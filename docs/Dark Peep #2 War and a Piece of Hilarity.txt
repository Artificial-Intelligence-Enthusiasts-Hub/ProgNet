War Spilled Over Into “Humor”
In a turn of events showcasing the profound effects of the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict
on the digital front, the website “Humor.co.il” recently faced a cyberattack. The KEP TEAM

for levity and laughter, is immune from the reach of hackers. The incident serves as a stark

emphasizing the need for heightened cyber vigilance.

REvil Resurfaces or Just a Shadow’s Trick?

9/12



A recent Telegram post that looks like from REvil, we are not sure, has left the cybersecurity
community in a dilemma: Is this the real deal Ransomware Evil “REvil” making a return, or is
it the work of a copycat, trying to ride on the infamous group’s fame? The message
suggests a possible alliance with Killnet and even jests about robbing banks across Europe.
While it’s laced with REvil’s characteristic audacity, only time will tell if this is genuinely their
work or an imitation act hoping to gain fame in the world of the Dark Web.

“powering down” for a brief 4-day getaway.
