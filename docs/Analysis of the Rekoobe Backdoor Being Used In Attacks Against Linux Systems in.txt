Korea

Rekoobe is a backdoor known to be used by APT31, a threat group based in China. AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)
has been receiving reports of the Rekoobe malware from tenants in Korea for several years, and will hereby share its brief analysis.
Additionally, the Rekoobe variants will be categorized along with a summary of the ones used to target Korean companies.

 
1. Overview
Rekoobe is a backdoor that targets Linux environments. It was first discovered in 2015, [1] and there is a case from 2018 where an updated
version of it was used in attacks. [2] Based on its supported architectures (x86, x64, and SPARC), Rekoobe in ELF format is primarily believed
to target Linux servers.

Known to have been created based on the source code of the open-source program Tiny SHell, which is publicly available on GitHub,
Rekoobe supports basic features as the name “Tiny” implies. [3] Aside from subsidiary features such as process name changing, it has only
three other features. It can download, upload, and execute commands from a C&C server. Due to its open-source foundation, categorizing
Rekoobe and similar variants can be challenging, but this post will analyze the generally known Rekoobe variants.

There is limited information available regarding how threat actors install Rekoobe on Linux systems and their specific targets. However,
Rekoobe is known for being a malware strain used by the Chinese threat group APT31. [4]

Generally, malware that target Linux servers focus on poorly managed servers or servers that are vulnerable due to not having been updated
to the latest version. It should be noted that there have been no confirmed cases of threat actors using Rekoobe to scan and launch brute-
force attacks on multiple Linux servers.

As a result, it is suspected that Linux servers that are primarily vulnerable due to not performing regular updates or having poor configurations
may be targeted, rather than systems with weak account credentials. Additionally, there have been reported cases of supply chain attacks
where a threat actor targeted a popular WordPress plugin and installed Rekoobe to gain control over compromised systems. [5]

 
2. Analysis of Rekoobe
Here, we will analyze one of the Rekoobe malware samples reported in Korea.

MD5: 8921942fb40a4d417700cfe37cce1ce7
C&C Server: resolv.ctmailer[.]net:80 (103.140.186.32)
Download URL: hxxp://103.140.186[.]32/mails

Rekoobe disguises itself by changing its process name to “/bin/bash”, which matches the name of a normal process. This makes it difficult for
users to detect its presence.  This is implemented by using the strcpy() function to change the arguments given upon executing the program.
Additionally, this particular feature is not present in the original Tiny SHell codebase.

Another notable difference between Rekoobe and Tiny SHell is the absence of command-line options for receiving the C&C server address or
password. Due to the lack of these options, the C&C server address is hard-coded in the malware.

P C&C URL or bind port number

S Change password

C C&C server address

Figure 2. Comparison between Tiny SHell and Rekoobe
Both Tiny SHell and Rekoobe utilize the HMAC SHA1 algorithm to generate an AES-128 key. This key is then used to encrypt the
communication data with the C&C server. The following is a brief summary of the communication process with the C&C server.

A. C&C -> Client: HMAC SHA1 generation
First, a 0x28-sized data packet is received from the C&C server. This packet is divided into two 0x14-byte segments, which are used as the IV
during the initialization of the HMAC SHA1 context. In addition, aside from the two 0x14-byte IVs that are transmitted during the initialization
process, a hard-coded password string, “0p;/9ol.”, is also used.

Figure 3. Hard-coded password used in key

generation
The generated HMAC SHA1 values serve as the AES-128 key. This key is used for encrypting data when sending it to the C&C server and
decrypting data received from the C&C server.

B. C&C -> REKOOBE: Integrity data
Next, 0x10-byte data is transmitted from the C&C server for integrity verification purposes. Rekoobe decodes this received data using the
previously set AES-128 key and performs an additional XOR operation. This process allows the malware to obtain the size of the subsequent
data it will receive. The subsequently transmitted data is used for integrity verification. It is 0x10 bytes and should have the same value as the
one shown below. Additionally, these values are the same as those designated in the Tiny SHell source code.

integrity check
C. REKOOBE -> C&C: Integrity data
Once the integrity verification process is complete, the malware reverses the process and sends the C&C server a 0x10-byte data segment
containing the same integrity data. When sending the data, it is also encrypted using the AES-128 key generated earlier from the HMAC SHA1
value.

D. C&C -> REKOOBE: C&C command
E. C&C -> REKOOBE: Additional data for each command
Once the previous steps are completed, a 1-byte command is received from the C&C server. Depending on the value of this 1 byte, three
different commands can be performed: file upload, file download, or reverse shell execution.

Command Number Command Type
1 Upload file

2 Download file

3 Reverse shell

Figure 6. Routine to connect to the C&C server and execute commands

Not only are there only three commands, but the structure of each command is simple as well. For example, when receiving a file download
command (0x02), the next packet received contains the path where the downloaded file should be written. The process only involves creating
a file in the specified path and writing the actual file data into it. The reverse shell command also has a simple format of redirecting the
standard input and output to the socket connected to the C&C server and executing /bin/sh.

3. Rekoobe Types
Although the analysis so far has focused on one particular sample, it is worth noting that Rekoobe is still being detected in numerous recent
samples. The similarities, differences, and characteristics of recently collected Rekoobe samples will be covered in this segment. The basic
structure of using an HMAC SHA1-based AES128 encryption algorithm for communication with the C&C server and the support for features
such as file download/upload and reverse shell remain consistent.

The major difference is the method of communication with the C&C server. The Rekoobe variant discussed above initially connects to a hard-
coded C&C server, but there are also variants that open ports and await connection from the C&C server in a bind shell form. This is possible
because Tiny SHell supports both methods.

Rekoobe is suspected to have a separate builder tool. One of the reasons for this assumption is the frequent appearance of malware that uses
the default string “replace with your password” instead of random password strings like the one covered above. Therefore, it is believed that
each malware is generated by a builder tool with the threat actor specifying a password for each attack. Unlike the passwords that use a
different string every time, the data used for integrity verification contrarily uses the same “58 90 AE 86 F1 B9 1C F6 29 83 95 71 1D DE 58
0D” like most other source codes.

 
4. Rekoobe Malware Used in Attacks Targeting Korea
The following are Rekoobe malware samples used in attacks targeting systems in Korea. Given that all the samples are based on the x64
architecture and in the form of reverse shell, it suggests that they were targeting Linux servers. The “mails” and “service” samples were
collected during a relatively similar time frame, and based on the almost identical passwords specified by the threat actor, it is presumed that
they were used by the same threat actor.

5. Conclusion
Rekoobe is a backdoor that can receive commands from a C&C server to perform various features such as downloading malicious files,
stealing internal files from a system, and executing reverse shell. While it may appear simple in structure, it employs encryption to evade
network packet detection and can perform a variety of malicious behaviors through commands from the threat actor.

Being based on an open-source code, Rekoobe can be used by other threat actors aside from the already identified Chinese threat group
APT31. It continues to be used in attacks targeting Linux servers, and cases of attacks against Korean systems are still being observed as
well.

To mitigate such security threats, it is crucial to examine vulnerable configuration settings and authentication credentials. Keeping relevant
systems up to date with the latest versions is also vital to protect against attacks of this nature. Also, V3 should be updated to the latest version
so that malware infection can be prevented.
