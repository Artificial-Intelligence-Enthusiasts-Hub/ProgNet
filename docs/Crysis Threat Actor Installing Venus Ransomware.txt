Crysis Threat Actor Installing Venus Ransomware
Through RDP

By Sanseo July 3, 2023

AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) has recently discovered that the
Crysis ransomware’s threat actor is also using the Venus ransomware in the attacks. Crysis
and Venus are both major ransomware types known to target externally exposed remote
desktop services. [1] Actual logs from the AhnLab Smart Defense (ASD) infrastructure also
show attacks being launched through RDP.

Aside from Crysis and Venus, the threat actor also installed a variety of other tools such as
Port Scanner and Mimikatz. If the infected systems are turned out to be a company’s internal
network, the network can also become a target by such tools, and there are actual cases.

 
1. Installing Ransomware Using RDP

Threat actors who use RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) as an attack vector generally scan
for systems where RDP is active and allows external access. Systems found during this
scanning process are subject to brute force or dictionary attacks. If a user has inappropriate
account credentials, then threat actors can easily take those very credentials.

Threat actors can use the obtained account credentials to log in to the system through RDP,
allowing them to gain control over the system in question and perform a variety of malicious
actions. The threat actor who installed the Venus ransomware likely used RDP as the attack
vector. This assumption is proved by the multiple malware types being generated by the
Windows Explorer process (explorer.exe) as shown below.

In attacks identified in the past, the threat actor first attempted to encrypt the infected system
using the Crysis ransomware, and after failing to do so, attempted encryption again using the
Venus ransomware.

Additionally, the threat actor used the same Crysis ransomware to continuously launch
attacks against other systems. One of the identified attacks employed the same tactic of
targeting an externally exposed RDP service. After the attack had succeeded, the attacker
accessed other systems through RDP and infected them with Crysis.

 
2. Malware Used in the Attack Process

The threat actor installs various malware types in the infected system. Installed tools are
scanners and account credential theft tools, most of them being created by NirSoft. It can be
assumed through this that the network of the infected system can also be targeted.

Table 1. Tools used in attacks
After the threat actor takes over the system via RDP, the above tools are used to scan the
network to check if the infected system is part of a specific network. If the system is part of a
specific network, then the ransomware can perform internal reconnaissance and collect
account credentials in order to also encrypt the other systems on the network. Mimikatz can
be used in this process. Using the collected account information, lateral movement can occur
to other systems within the network. In an actual attack case involving Crysis, the threat
actor used RDP for lateral movement into other systems within the network.

The threat actor ultimately executed Crysis to encrypt the system, and after recognizing
failure after a few hours, retried the attack using Venus. If the Crysis ransomware ran
correctly, the user would have seen the following ransom note.

3. Venus Ransomware

Among the files copied to the Download folder by the threat actor, Venus ransomware has
the name bild.exe_.

Overview Description
Extension .venus

Paths excluded from encryption “Tor Browser”, “Windows”, “dropbox”, “iexplorer”

Paths excluded from encryption “venus”, “README.txt”, “README.html”

Ransom note README.html

Table 2. Venus Ransomware overview
Venus first terminates various programs such as Office, email clients, and databases to
encrypt more files.

Table 3. List of target processes for termination
An icon for the .venus file extension is registered before the encryption process begins.
Because the encrypted files’ file extensions are changed to .venus, users see the files with
the following icon.

Figure 4. Encrypted files
The command used by Venus to delete volume shadow copies are as follows.

> cmd.exe /C wbadmin delete catalog -quiet && vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all
/quiet && bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff && wmic SHADOWCOPY DELETE

At this stage, the ransomware changes the desktop and displays the README file. The file
contains a message saying that the threat actors had stolen information from the system and
encrypted the files, urging the user to make contact within 48 hours.

4. Conclusion

Attackers have continuously been using RDP from the past in the initial compromise and
lateral movement processes. These attacks usually occur through brute force and dictionary
attacks against systems with inappropriate account credentials. In particular, many
ransomware operators use RDP as their main initial attack vector besides the Crysis threat
actors in this Venus ransomware incident.

Users can deactivate RDP when not in use to decrease the number of attack attempts. If
RDP is being used, it is advised to use a complex account password and to change it
periodically to prevent brute force and dictionary attacks. Also, V3 should be updated to the
latest version so that malware infection can be prevented.
