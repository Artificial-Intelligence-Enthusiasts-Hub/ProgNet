TALK TO AN EXPERT
Adversaries don’t work 9-5 and neither do we. At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with
Elite Threat Hunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to
threats within minutes.

We have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our
space – including the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.

Our Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat
Response and Advanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU
team.

In TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent
threat investigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what
recommendations we have going forward.

Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…

What did we find?

In December 2023, this blog post was revised based on insights from Proofpoint's
researcher, known as @Myrtus0x0. The malware under investigation has been identified as
'Latrodectus', which is believed to have been developed by the creators of IcedID.

In early November 2023, the eSentire Threat Response Unit (TRU) detected the presence of
DanaBot, a sophisticated banking Trojan renowned for its ability to pilfer banking credentials,
personal information, and hVNC (hidden Virtual Network Computing) feature (Figure 1).

This malware was being employed to deliver IcedID, a banking Trojan that has been active
since 2017 and is widely recognized for its various capabilities. Notably, since 2020, IcedID
has been linked to ransomware attacks, including those involving Egregor, Maze, and Conti.

In a recent case, we assess with high confidence that the initial infection for DanaBot
occurred via a drive-by download. The user was likely searching for a Webex installer and
visited an imposter website serving the payload. The archive payload is named Webex.zip
(MD5: 4be85751a07081de31f52329c2e2ddc8).

The archive contains the following files:

rash.docx (IDAT Loader encrypted file), MD5: 34b87976172e911e3e2ed6007252e7dc

4/17



sqlite3.dll – malicious side-loaded DLL, MD5: 4ca6db064effc1730299a0f20531e49c
webex.exe – legitimate binary, MD5: 1f166f5c76eb155d44dd1bf160f37a6a

Upon execution of webex.exe, it will side-load the malicious DLL (sqlite3.dll), decrypt and
decompress the contents of rash.docx file, perform injection into explorer.exe via Process
Doppelgänging, and decrypt and run the final payload. In our case, it’s DanaBot (MD5:
6ad1d4e1ca3f1784840364700f5a8a14).

We have observed DanaBot dropping the following files on the infected system under
%TEMP% folder:

10608194856200.exe (MD5: 0d0c437a39787127fc0fbf19efc747ab), the file is, what we
assess, an IcedID VNC module
c5cfe172.dll, IcedID loader (MD5: 350915536540a76d44ce12dc03450424)

Upon execution of the IDAT loader, two folders are created under %AppData%:

DownloadWordpadISR (folder that contains rash.docx and sqlite3.dll)
Custom_update (folder that contains IcedID payloads Update_* (for example,
Update_88d58563) and update_data.dat)

The persistence for DanaBot is created via Startup folder (T1547.001) for webex.exe binary.

IcedID Technical Analysis
After the IcedID payload decryption, it creates a copy of itself under “%AppData%\
Custom_update\ Update_{8-hexidecimal-characters}”. The 8 hexadecimal characters are
determined by the function in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Hexadecimal value generation

The payload retrieves the volume serial number of the infected machine via
GetVolumeInformationW API and multiplies the result with the seed value 0x19660D. The
returned result is then used as a part of the DLL filename appended after “Update_” as 8

hexadecimal characters.

The function then proceeds and enters the loop where it performs the multiplication with the
seed value with the result of each seeded value returned from the mw_seed function; it then
grabs the first byte from each calculated result and builds a 14-byte unique HWID string that
is sent to C2.

IcedID uses a CRC-32 hashing algorithm to calculate the hashes for the APIs used in the
binary (Figures 3-4).

Figure 3: CRC-32 API hashing function

Figure 4: CRC-32 calculated API hashes

The string decryption (Figure 5) is performed based on the following algorithm:

6/17



The function initializes using the first 4 bytes derived from the encrypted string.
Within prng_gen function, it generates a series of pseudo-random values based on the
first 4-bytes derived from the encrypted string.
For each byte in a certain range, it performs a bitwise XOR with the pseudo-random
value and a byte from the offset location in the encrypted string.

Figure 5: String decryption function

We wrote the script to decrypt the strings with IDAPython. You can access the script here.

The decrypted strings can be accessed here.

IcedID creates the hardcoded mutex “runnung". If the payload fails to create a mutex or if the
mutex already exists (indicated by the error code 183, which typically means
ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS), then the payload enters an infinite loop delay using
NtDelayExecution (1000 milliseconds of delay) (Figure 6).

This prevents multiple instances of infections on the same infected machine.

Figure 6: IcedID enters an infinite loop of delays if the mutex already exists

The campaign ID is generated using the hardcoded string in the binary; in our binary, it’s
“Novik”, and FNV hashing algorithm.

7/17



Figure 7: FNV hashing algorithm

Here is the implementation of the algorithm in Python:

def mw_fnv(input_str): 
   v3 = 0x811C9DC5 
   for char in input_str: 
       v3 = (v3 ^ ord(char)) * 0x1000193 
       v3 &= 0xFFFFFFFF   
   return v3 
fnv_hash = mw_fnv("Novik") # input your hardcoded string here 
print(fnv_hash) 

Upon successful infection, IcedID runs the following reconnaissance commands on the
infected host:

C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c ipconfig /all
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c systeminfo
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c nltest /domain_trusts
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c net view /all /domain
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c net view /all
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c net group "Domain Admin”
C:\Windows\System32\wbem\wmic.exe /Node:localhost
/Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get * /Format:List
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c net config workstation
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c wmic.exe /node:localhost
/namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 path AntiVirusProduct Get DisplayName | findstr /V
/B /C:dis
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c whoami /groups
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe  
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe

The results then are converted into base64-encoded strings and appended to the following
tags accordingly:

8/17



&ipconfig=
&systeminfo=
&domain_trusts=
&domain_trusts_all=
&net_view_all_domain=
&net_view_all=
&net_group=
&net_config_ws=
&net_wmic_av=
&whoami_group=

Figure 8 shows the function responsible for the following:

Decrypts and sets HTTP headers (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded).
Determines the request method (POST or GET) based on the input parameter a2,
decrypts the relevant method string, and prepares it for use.
Calls HttpOpenRequestA with parameters including the request method, URL, and
other settings. The request is opened using a handle provided by InternetOpenW.
Checks if HttpOpenRequestA successfully created a request handle.

If it's a POST request, it calculates the length of the request data and headers,
then sends the HTTP request with HttpSendRequestA using these lengths and
the base64-encoded data.
If it's a GET request, it sends the request without additional data.

Figure 8: HTTP Request Handler Function

The payload enumerates through the list of running processes using APIs such as
CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, Process32First, and Process32Next and appends the results to
the following tags:

&proclist=
“pid":
"proc":
"subproc":

The persistence is achieved via the scheduled task named “Updater”. The task runs at every
log on with the following command:

rundll32.exe "C:\Users\
<username>\AppData\Roaming\Custom_update\Update_88d58563.dll", scab

Previously, we mentioned IcedID deploying the VNC module. There are a few interesting
strings in the payload that we observed:

{%0.8X-%0.4X-%0.4X-%0.4X-%0.4X%0.8X}
%ProgramFiles%\
gw@SET TO TOP
%ProgramData%\
%LOCALAPPDATA%\

FOREGRAUND
%APPDATA%\
%ProgramFiles(x86)%\
/NOUACCHECK

hdesk

What did we do?
Our team of 24/7 SOC Cyber Analysts detected malicious network connections originating
from the rundll32.exe process, isolated the affected machine, and informed the impacted
customer.

What can you learn from this TRU Positive?
The use of drive-by downloads for initial infection shows the effectiveness of this
method for deploying malware, emphasizing the risk associated with unverified
downloads.
The execution of a legitimate binary to side-load a malicious DLL highlights advanced
techniques used by attackers to evade detection.

10/17



IcedID's approach to preventing multiple infections on the same machine using a
hardcoded mutex and entering an infinite loop if the mutex exists showcases a method
to avoid detection and potential interference with other malware.
The use of the FNV hashing algorithm to generate campaign IDs based on hardcoded
strings.
The execution of various system commands post-infection for reconnaissance
purposes underlines the importance of monitoring command line activity on
endpoints.Top of Form

Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU) Team:
Prioritize application installations from your organization’s library of approved
applications (if implemented).
Treat files downloaded from the Internet with the same vigilance as those delivered
through email. Assume files are potentially hostile regardless of the path that got you
there. Remember, a website hosting software advertised on a trusted search engine
does not inherit that trust.
Encouraging good cybersecurity hygiene among your users by using Phishing and
Security Awareness Training (PSAT) when downloading software from the Internet.
Protect endpoints against malware by:

Ensuring antivirus signatures are up-to-date.
Using a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool to
detect and contain threats.
