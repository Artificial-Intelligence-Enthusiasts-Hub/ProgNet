AgentVX and Taurus
aon.com/cyber-solutions/aon_cyber_labs/agentvx-and-taurus/

In an investigation occurring in 2021,  Stroz Friedberg Incident Response Services team (Stroz Friedberg) encountered
a new payload associated with the Taurus loader. Typically, the information security community sees this loader
associated with the Taurus Stealer malware. The Taurus Stealer has the ability to collect information from various web
browsers, including passwords, cookies, autofill forms and history. However, in this instance, Stroz Friedberg identified
a new payload named “AgentVX”. This payload contains several functions outlined below. On September 19th, 2022,
NSFOCUS Security Labs released an article attributing AgentVX to the group “Evilnum.” Since 2021, Stroz Friedberg
 has not seen publicly available information relating this loader and payload.  We are releasing this blog post to provide
additional threat intelligence on the AgentVX payload and release a script to assist with the automated decoding of the
Taurus loader.

Taurus Loader
In this investigation, the Taurus loader matched publicly available analysis and Minerva Labs posted analysis on it
earlier in 2021. The execution chain begins with a self-extracting archive. This archive drops the following files to
“%AppData%\BueedgFYHdzEt\”:

File Description

Andate.xlm Corrupt PE, used to build “Sapro.exe.com”

Calpestare.pptm Unused

Poi.xltx Obfuscated AutoIT loader is renamed to “x” and executed

Sapro.exe.com AutoIT executable used for injection of payload

Seguente.mpg Obfuscated batch file used to control the execution flow

Sta.xll Encrypted “AgentVX” payload that is injected into “Sapro.exe.com”

Upon execution, the malware executes “Seguente.mpg”, which conducts multiple kill-switch checks that are consistent
with the Taurus loader including:

Attempts to connect to the non-existent domain “QYLBUtMSCcIS.QYLBUtMSCcIS”
Checks for the existence of a file called “C:\aaa_TouchMeNot_.txt”
Checks to see if the system name is “DESKTOP-QO5QU33”. The information security community has written
about the name of this system multiple times.

When the checks pass, the malware continues execution to execute the obfuscated AutoIT script, “Poi.xlxt”. The AutoIT
script conducts additional checks like the above, including checking for the same system name of “DESKTOP-
QO5QU33”. If these checks pass, the malware injects a decrypted version of “Sta.xll” (AgentVX) into the newly created
“Sapro.exe.com” process.

The Taurus AutoIT loader, “Poi.xlxt”, obfuscates its strings by using an algorithm which takes an integer and an offset,
then converts the integer and offset to its ASCII value. Below is an example of an encoded string that uses an offset
value of 2:

Encoded String Decoded String

“74>89>112>102>42>51>56>56>43”,2 HWnd(166)

1/6



Performing the decoding manually for a sample is a very lengthy and cumbersome process. Stroz Friedberg has
released code to assist with automatic extraction and decoding of the Taurus AutoIT loader strings. Decoding of the
strings allows for quicker analysis of the Taurus loader, allowing an analyst to see de-obfuscated function calls to
kernel32 and commands to be run by the script.  The Python function described below will de-obfuscate AutoIT strings
manually:

def decodeTaurus(string, integer, delim): 
   res = '' 
   tab = string.split(delim) 
   for character in tab: 
           res = res + chr(int(character)-int(integer)) 
   return res

The execution chain of the self-extracting archive to AgentVX is described in the below figure, followed by a short
description of each step in the chain:

D Identification of start of encrypted pa yload
E Execution of Taurus AutoIT loader which is  renamed from “Poi.xlxt” to “x”
F Execution of AgentVX via injection into “Sapro.exe.com”  

AgentVX
Once the loading steps complete, the malware attempts to establish a connection to the Command and Control (C2)
server with the following details:

Type IOC

Domain cdn.nvbcloud[.]com

URI /timeout/voip.aspx

User- Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Agent Chrome/57.0.2987.133 Safari/537.36

AgentVX begins by dynamically resolving functions. The malware will gather fingerprint information to send to the C2
server, including:

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version
.NET version
Directory listing for “Program Files” and “Program Files (x86)” directories
Drive letters
OS version

2/6



Once the malware establishes C2 connectivity, it beacons out to the C2 every 6 seconds using the same details above.
It waits to receive a “task list” from the server. The task list contains one or multiple tasks to complete and options for
those tasks. The tasks within the task list can be any of the following:

Download and execute – this receives a payload from a server provided in the task options. The options allow for
the operator to save the payload to disk and execute it, or to inject it into another process memory using calls to:
NtMapViewOfSection, VirtualProtectEx, WriteProccessMemory, and ResumeThread. If the operator chooses
process injection, they can specify if they wish the payload to be injected into one of the following:

– %SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe
– %SystemRoot%\Syswow64\nslookup.exe  

If this task fails, the malware prints a debug string of “Download and execute failed.”

Execute – this receives a base64 encoded payload from the task options. If the payload is an executable, it writes
the executable to disk and names it a random number from 6 to 12 and appends a “.exe” on the end. If the
payload is a DLL, it allows the operator to choose one of the following to inject the payload into:

– %SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe
– %SystemRoot%\Syswow64\nslookup.exe  
– %SystemRoot%\System32\nslookup.exe  

Execute and setup persistence – this allows the operator to provide three base64 encoded payloads, at least one
of which must be an executable. The malware downloads and writes the executable to disk. The executable is
named with a random number between 6 and 12 and is given the “.exe” extension (i.e., 6.exe). It will set this
executable up with persistence by adding the following registry key:

– HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

<random_string> = <XXX_PATH_TO_EXECUTE_XYZ>

The other two payloads use hardcoded file names:

– Dbghelp.dll
– Pic.png  

Cleanup Persistence – this option removes the registry run key persistence set by the “Execute and setup
persistence” option.
Setup new module – This function receives a base64 encoded DLL which the malware parses for the following
exports:

– AgentVXModuleInitializer
– OnLoad  
– OnUnLo ad
– IsPersisten t
– GetModuleN ame
– GetMinimumVers ion
– ReadCommunication 

The malware checks its version and if the version is less than “1.6d.1”, it prints the debug string: “Bot version is too low
to install.”

Get running modules – this gets the list of running modules specific to the malware.

3/6



Execute Function – This allows the operator to specify another function of the malware to execute. In total, there
are 156 functions that the malware can execute. Below are examples of the capabilities that four of these
functions provide:

Manipulation of clipboard data
Collection of browser data from Firefox or Chrome. Only one of the browsers is targeted at a time. Stroz
Friedberg suspects this is a bug in the malware. During this process, the malware creates the folder:
%AppData%\XProfiles
File and directory upload and download
Collection of screenshots

Threat Intelligence
Stroz Friedberg captured an image of the threat actor’s malware administration panel for AgentVX. The panel shows
the title of “AgentVX from Cerberus” in the top left corner. Additionally, Stroz Friedberg observed the following
similarities during our analysis of the malware:

The BotID length and alphanumeric pattern matches what we observed in the threat actor’s control panel.

The malware shows the error message “Download and Execute failed” while the threat actor’s control panel
displays a task named “Download and Execute”.

The malware can execute various procedures which it refers to as “tasks”. The threat actor’s control panel shows
that “tasks” for bots can be updated.

In the malware, one particular task can have options such as EXE, MEMORY and NATIVE associated with it while
the threat actor’s control panel shows that a task has options of EXE, MEMORY and DISK.

Indicators of Compromise
Stroz Friedberg recommends alerting and blacklisting (where possible) the following indicators to help prevent and
detect the AgentVX malware:
