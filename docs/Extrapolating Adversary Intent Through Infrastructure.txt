Extrapolating Adversary Intent Through Infrastructure

Introduction
Adversary cyber operations require communication to victim networks in order to deliver
effects on objectives. When performed over public networks, competent adversaries rarely
(if ever) communicate directly from their “home” locations but use various proxied
infrastructure: servers denoted by IP addresses, or identified via domain names. While
there are many instances of adversaries using either pseudo-random or meaningless
strings for domains, or eschewing these items altogether and simply communicating directly
to an IP address, instances of deliberate adversary name choice can be revealing.

Looking at domain names as composite objects - consisting of multiple components such
as the domain registrar or where a domain resolves - allows us to track adversary activity
and infrastructure creation through tendencies and patterns. Just as with items such as
authoritative name servers or registration information, the very name chosen for a domain
has significance, and can identify fundamental adversary behaviors.

Adversaries typically leverage themes in domain creation that can indicate aspects of
attacker operations. This could include:

Blending in with likely “normal” traffic within targeted environments.
Mirroring services or functions targeted for operations, such as logon portals.
Matching target characteristics to facilitate interaction or lower suspicion when
identified.

By studying adversary naming choices, we can begin identifying various aspects of attacker
operations - from how initial access operations may take place through likely victimology
based on observations. In the following three examples, we will explore relatively recent
campaigns to identify how adversary naming choice and patterns can be used to gain
greater understanding of attacker goals and operations.

Sandworm and the 2018 Olympics
Reviewing the recent US Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment against six members of
Russian military intelligence (GRU) Unit 74455, commonly referred to as “Sandworm”,
shows several infrastructure items related to attacks on the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter
Olympics:

Msrole[.]com
Jeojang[.]ga

2/13



The items were used to spoof Microsoft services and the Korean Ministry of Agriculture,
Food, and Rural Affairs, respectively. As supported in the indictment and other technical
analysis, these items were leveraged as themes for infrastructure used to support phishing
activity and credential theft.

More interesting still, further analysis using DomainTools Iris indicates a wider campaign
with additional themes. For example, viewing Passive DNS (pDNS) information for
msrole[.]com identifies a series of IP addresses used during the run-up to the Olympics:

Most significant, and highlighted above, is the 27.102.102.30 address. Hosted in The
Republic of Korea (ROK, or South Korea), this address hosted msrole[.]com during the
period of action prior to the Olympic Destroyer incident during the Pyeongchang opening
ceremonies in February 2018. Analyzing this IP address and its history during the time prior
to the Olympic Destroyer incident reveals additional details:

3/13



In addition to mapping the movement of msrole[.]com over time, Passive DNS monitoring
via DomainTools Iris reveals additional items neither noted in the US DOJ indictment nor
previously disclosed as part of the OlympicDestroyer event:

Culturecommunication[.]ga
Starcraft2[.]cf
Swisstiming[.]cf

While “Culture Communication” is somewhat ambiguous, the other items seem
appropriately themed for the target event and country: Swiss Timing is the official
timekeeper of the Olympic Games (including the 2018 Winter Games) through 2032; while
StarCraft (both the original and its sequel) remains one of the most popular games (and
esport events) in ROK.

Irrespective of other observables (some of which are now unavailable over two years after
the events in question), the names used by the GRU operators in creating infrastructure
reveal degrees of intentionality. As already stated (without details) in the DOJ indictment,
actions included operations linked to the official Olympics timekeeper organization -
unearthing the specific domain confirms this observation. But the StarCraft spoof indicates
potentially wider targeting of ROK persons, leveraging the popularity of the game to create
a mechanism (whose precise functionality is indeterminate now) to further operations
against the ROK-hosted games.

4/13



While we have unearthed additional indicators of compromise (IOCs), more importantly
through analysis of infrastructure we identified a pattern in domain creation centered on a
combination of technology (Microsoft spoofing), culture (the StarCraft item), and event (the
2018 Olympics).

Energetic Bear and Airports
In October 2020, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a joint report on malicious actor targeting of
local government and related critical infrastructure entities in the United States (US). Linked
to an entity assessed by US government sources to be Russian state sponsored and called
variously Energetic Bear, Dragonfly, Crouching Yeti, or ALLANITE, the operations focused
on spoofing legitimate websites as a mechanism for gathering credentials to enable follow-
on intrusions.

First emerging in Spring 2020 with a compromise at San Francisco International Airport, this
specific campaign appears to have expanded significantly to include a number of other
locations and regions within the United States - often focused on airports.

5/13



Of interest in the Energetic Bear campaign though is the shift from credential theft via
strategic website compromise - seen in the code snippet found in the SFO website in
ESET’s Tweet - to more direct credential phishing. As listed in CISA Alert AA20-269A, the
attacker shifted operations from indirect credential capture to more direct forms through
website spoofing.

This behavior is reflected in domains observed in the campaign:

email.microsoftonline[.]services
columbusairports.microsoftonline[.]host

6/13



Additionally, CISA notes a pattern of infrastructure using the following domain name pattern
associated with Microsoft Azure cloud services:

        [City Name].westus2.cloudapp.azure[.]com

Reviewing pDNS data via DomainTools Iris shows that these items all link back to similar
infrastructure during their time of weaponization:

Primary domain themes - spoofing Microsoft - reflect the shift in adversary behavior. When
paired with exploit chaining as documented in a related CISA alert, overall the collection of
observed behaviors including domain themes demonstrate a significant overall change in
Energetic Bear tactics, techniques, and procedures. Identifying such developments as they
emerge allows defenders to appropriately adapt security measures and analysis of potential
incidents.

Kimsuky Infrastructure and Themes
On 27 October 2020, CISA released an extensive report covering activity associated with
the Kimsuky actor. Linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North
Korea), Kimsuky is responsible for multiple campaigns against ROK critical infrastructure
entities, Korean peninsula nuclear negotiation entities, and various targets in ROK, Japan,
and the United States.

In addition to coverage of Kimsuky intrusion techniques and behaviors, the CISA report
contains nearly one hundred network indicators in the form of domains and subdomains.
Reviewing the naming conventions used identifies three broad themes:

First, spoofing popular services, especially in ROK, for infrastructure creation. For example,
Kimsuky targets ROK web portal and search engine Naver in multiple instances, such as:

Help-navers[.]com            naver.com[.]se 
Helpnaver[.]com              naver.hol[.]es 
naver.co[.]in                naver.koreagov[.]com 
naver.com[.]cm               naver.onegov[.]com 
naver.com[.]de               naver.unibok[.]kr 
naver.com[.]ec               naver[.]cx 
naver.com[.]mx               naver[.]pw 
naver.com[.]pl               naverdns[.]co 

Similar activity surrounds Korean webportal Daum:

daum.net[.]pl                login.daum.kcrct[.]ml 
Daurn.pe[.]hu                login.daum.net-accounts[.]info 
daurn[.]org                  login.daum.unikortv[.]com 

Service spoofing such as the above can be used to either mimic pages for exploitation or
credential harvesting, or as a means to hide command and control (C2) communications.
However, geographic specificity in these particular cases indicate the domains in question
are almost certainly limited in application to Korean-language audiences. As such, while
these items are interesting in learning about Kimsuky activity, they are likely less significant
from a defensive action standpoint for non-Korean entities.

8/13



Second, and as observed in some of the domains above, Kimsuky features a pattern of
persistent service spoofing especially centered around webmail or cloud storage logon
pages. This is expressed through a pattern of subdomain creation reflected across multiple
domains, all hosted on the same infrastructure during use. As shown in DomainTools Iris
pDNS results, a familiar pattern emerges with mail-themed subdomains linked to generic,
IT-themed primary domains:

9/13



Reviewing items active in Kimsuky-related operations shows a persistent pattern. First, a
“generic” technical domain is used as a root item (e.g., “com-ssl[.]work” or “com-
vps[.]work”), followed by a common sequence of webmail or related subdomains:

Mail
Mail2
Drive
Onedrive
Login

The thematic basis behind these items (“e.g., “onedrive.sslport[.]work”) implies intentionality
as a mechanism for serving a spoofed logon page (in this specific example, for the
Microsoft OneDrive service) for credential gathering.

Third, and observed in the subdomains examined above, we can also glimpse potential
specific targets of Kimsuky campaigns as reflected in naming patterns and conventions. For
example, the following items appear to indicate targeted institutions:

Intranet.ohchr.account-protect[.]work

10/13



Smt.docomo.ne.jp-ssl[.]work
Rfanews.sslport[.]work
mail.rfa.sslport[.]work

The above items appear to mimic the legitimate domain naming patterns of the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (ohchr.org), Japanese
telecommunication company NTT Docomo (nttdocomo.co.jp), and Radio Free Asia
(rfa.org). Along with domains which reference subjects such as Korean unification, these
items allow us to expand our view of Kimsuky activities to include “soft” targets in consumer
communications, human rights causes, and similar entities beyond classic espionage goals.

Analyzing Kimsuky infrastructure activity allows defenders to glimpse not only attacker
methodologies but also potential targets - in terms of both targeted services and targeted
organizations. With this relatively minimal amount of information, defenders can better
understand Kimsuky motivations and appropriately vector resources for defensive and
monitoring purposes.

Conclusion
Examining the three separate campaigns above, as defenders we are able to infer
adversary intentionality and purpose based on little more than analysis of domain naming
schema. When combined with further research, such as additional pivots in DomainTools
Iris into SSL/TLS certificates, hosting infrastructure, and registration patterns, defenders
can leverage this knowledge to gain even greater understanding of attacker operations.

Yet even without significant additional information, minimal pivoting unearths items of
significance:

Sandworm activity targeting multiple areas of South Korean society and the 2018
Olympics in the run-up to Olympic Destroyer.
Energetic Bear shifting operations from passive credential collection via strategic
website compromise to more active credential phishing through spoofed domains.
Kimsuky operations targeting prominent commercial and non-government
organizations beyond traditional espionage targets via likely credential capture
resources.

Armed with this information, defenders can make nuanced, informed decisions about
adversary development. With such understanding in hand, defenders can appropriately
adjust security controls and visibility to match observed behaviors. While more robust
mechanisms for research and analysis exist to allow us to dig even deeper, simple
recognition of naming patterns and their implications can prove quite powerful in furthering
security operations.
