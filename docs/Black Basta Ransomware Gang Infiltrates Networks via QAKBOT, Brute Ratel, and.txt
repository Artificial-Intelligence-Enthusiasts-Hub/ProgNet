We analyzed a QAKBOT-related case leading to a Brute Ratel C4 and Cobalt Strike payload that can be attributed to the threat actors behind
the Black Basta ransomware.

Summary
QAKBOT’s malware distribution resumed on September 8, 2022 following a brief hiatus, when our researchers spotted several distribution
mechanisms on this date. The distribution methods observed included SmokeLoader (using the ‘snow0x’ distributor ID), Emotet (using the
‘azd‘ distributor id), and malicious spam that used the ‘BB’ and ‘Obama20x’ IDs.

A recent case involving the QAKBOT ‘BB’ distributor led to the deployment of Brute Ratel (detected by Trend Micro as
Backdoor.Win64.BRUTEL) —  a framework similar to Cobalt Strike — as a second-stage payload. This is a noteworthy development because
it is the first time we have observed Brute Ratel as a second-stage payload via a QAKBOT infection. The attack also involved the use of Cobalt
Strike itself for lateral movement. We attribute these activities to the threat actors behind the Black Basta ransomware.

The rise of Brute Ratel and other C&C frameworks

1/13



Brute Ratel is a commercial (paid) Adversary Emulation framework and a relative newcomer to the commercial C&C Framework space, where
it competes with more established players such as Cobalt Strike.

Adversary Emulation frameworks like Brute Ratel and Cobalt Strike are marketed to penetration testing professionals (Red Teams) for use in
legitimate penetration testing activities in which organizations seek to improve their ability to detect and respond to real cyberattacks. These
frameworks are used to provide hands-on keyboard access from remote locations to emulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
used by attackers in network intrusions.

On top of Cobalt Strike’s legitimate use cases, it has gained notoriety for its illicit usage and near omnipresence in high-profile, human-
operated ransomware attacks during the past few years. It serves as a common second-stage payload from Botnets such as QAKBOT
(TrojanSpy.Win64.QAKBOT), IcedID (TrojanSpy.Win64.ICEDID), Emotet (TrojanSpy.Win64.EMOTET), and Bumblebee
(Trojan.Win64.BUMBLELOADER), among others. Unfortunately, several versions of Cobalt Strike have been leaked over the past couple of
years, accelerating its malicious use by cybercriminals.

As a result of its popularity compared to Brute Ratel, its detection coverage is greater than that of the latter. This makes Brute Ratel and other
less established C&C frameworks an increasingly more attractive option for malicious actors, whose activities may remain undetected for a
longer period.

Brute Ratel has recently attracted greater interest from threat actors in the cybercriminal underground, where versions of the framework are
actively traded and cracked versions circulated. It is unknown how Brute Ratel was initially leaked, but its developers have acknowledged the
leak on Twitter.

A summary of the campaign’s procedure
The campaign commences via a SPAM email containing a malicious new URL being sent to potential victims. The URL landing page presents
the recipient with a password for a ZIP file.

Sandbox and security solution evasion
The use of password-protected ZIP files at this stage is likely an attempt to evade analysis by security solutions.

Mark of the Web evasion

The ZIP file contains a single .ISO file. The use of an ISO file is an attempt to defeat the “Mark of the Web (MOTW),” which tags files as being
downloaded from the internet. It subjects these files to additional security measures by Windows and endpoint security solutions.

The ISO file contains a visible LNK file that uses the “Explorer” icon and two hidden subdirectories, each containing various files and
directories. By default, on Windows operating systems, hidden files are not displayed to the user. Figure 5 illustrates what the user sees when
the “Show hidden files” setting is enabled.

Command-line interface - Execution sequence
QAKBOT uses obfuscation across two script files, a JavaScript (.js) file and a Batch Script (.cmd) file, likely in an effort to conceal suspicious-
looking command lines.

Initial QAKBOT C&C server communication
The C&C Infrastructure is geographically distributed across compromised hosts residing in predominantly residential Internet Service Provider
(ISP) broadband networks.

The following countries are where the C&C servers reside:

Afghanistan
Algeria
Argentina
Austria
Brazil

Bulgaria
Canada
Chile
Colombia
Egypt
India
Indonesia
Japan
Mexico
Mongolia
Morocco
Netherlands
Qatar
Russia
South Africa
Taiwan
Thailand
Turkey
United Arab Emirates
United Kingdom
United States
Vietnam
Yemen

These ‘Tier 1’ C&C Servers are considered disposable by the QAKBOT operators and are replaced frequently (nearly every time there is a
new distribution of the malware), though some persist across multiple QAKBOT malware configurations.

 
Automated reconnaissance commands

 
Just six minutes after the initial C&C communication, and with the QAKBOT malware now running inside an injected process (wermgr.exe),
 automated reconnaissance in the infected environment is performed via the execution of multiple built-in command line tools. The execution of
these command lines is in the following order:

Order Process Command Line

1 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\net.exe net view

2 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ARP.EXE arp -a

3 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ipconfig.exe ipconfig /all

4 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\nslookup.exe nslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain_fqdn>

5 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\net.exe net share

6 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ROUTE.EXE route print

7 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\NETSTAT.EXE netstat -nao

8 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\net.exe net localgroup

9 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\whoami.exe whoami /all

Table 2. The order of execution for the built-in command lines

This activity is visible in Trend Micro Vision One™, which detects the suspicious usage of these built-in Windows commands.

QAKBOT drops Brute Ratel
Five minutes after the automated reconnaissance activities are completed, the QAKBOT-injected wermgr.exe process drops the Brute Ratel
DLL and invokes it via a rundll32.exe child process with the “main” export function.

Second, the SharpHound utility is run via Brute Ratel in an injected svchost.exe process to output JSON files that are ingested into
BloodHound (that describes the Active Directory Organisational Units, Group Policies, Domains, User Groups, Computers, and Users). The
files are then packed into a ZIP file in preparation for exfiltration. The entire process is scripted and takes less than two seconds to complete.

 

 Figure 10. Outputting JSON files via svchost.exe

Brute Ratel drops Cobalt Strike
Interestingly, the actors chose to leverage Cobalt Strike for lateral movement. The first of several beacon files are dropped onto the same
infected endpoint running Brute Ratel C4, with the first being:

C:\Users\Public\Name-123456.xls

This beacon file is executed on the same host running the Brute Ratel C4 using the following command:

rundll32 C:\users\public\Name-123456.xls,DllRegisterServer
 

The actor drops the other beacon files and copies these to administrative shares on other hosts on the network, again using filenames bearing
XLS attachments.

C:\Users\Public\abcabc.xls
C:\Users\Public\abc-1234.xls
C:\Users\Public\Orders_12_34_56.xls
C:\Users\Public\MkDir.xls

The commands used to copy the files are as follows:

C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C copy C:\users\public\fksro.xls 
\\<HOST>\C$\users\public\abcabc.xls  

The following list is the beacon C&C Servers:

hxxps://fewifasoc[.]com | 45.153.242[.]251
hxxps://hadujaza[.]com | 45.153.241[.]88
hxxps://himiketiv[.]com | 45.153.241[.]64

The threat actors were then evicted from the environment before any final actions could be taken. We assess based on the level of access and
discovery activity that the likely final actions would have been a domain-wide ransom deployment.

QAKBOT ‘Obama’ to Brute Ratel
 

8/13



In another, more recent, incident, Trend Micro Research spotted QAKBOT using the “Obama” distributor ID prefix (i.e. “Obama208”) also
dropping Brutel Ratel C4 as a second-stage payload.

In this case, the malware arrives as a password-protected ZIP file delivered via HTML smuggling, which allows the attacker to “smuggle” an
encoded malicious script into an HTML attachment or web page. Once the user opens the HTML page in the browser, the script is decoded
and the payload is assembled. 

Figure 11. QAKBOT distributors use password protection to defeat network and sandbox security scans
Once the ZIP file is decrypted using the password provided in the HTML attachment, the user is presented with an ISO file. The malicious files
are contained in the ISO file, which is used as a Mark of the Web bypass. Inside, an ISO file bears the following directory structure:

 Figure 12. ISO file directory structure

Since QAKBOT’s return, we have observed multiple varieties in the execution chain, from scripting languages to file extensions and the use of
export function names and ordinals. For this infection, the following variation was used:

9/13



 Figure 13. The

variation used for the infection
The infection plays out with the same TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) described in the first kill chain in this blog. However, one
notable difference was observed in the C&C configuration, which used DNS over HTTPS (DoH) vs a more traditional HTTPS C&C Channel.
 The C&C servers observed used HTTPS with Let’s-Encrypt.

By using DoH, attackers can hide DNS queries from C&C domains. If SSL/TLS traffic is not being inspected using man-in-the-middle (MitM)
techniques, DNS queries to the C&C server will therefore go unnoticed.

performing C&C Communication via DNS over HTTPS (DoH). The threat was contained before any final actions could be taken.

Figure 15. Brute Ratel and Cobalt Strike Infrastructure used in QakBot to Black Basta Intrusions (click the image for a larger version of it)
Based on our investigations, we can confirm that the QAKBOT-to-Brute Ratel-to-Cobalt Strike kill chain is associated with the group behind the
Black Basta Ransomware. This is based on overlapping TTPs and infrastructure observed in Black Basta attacks. It is not the first time that we
have observed intrusions via QAKBOT leading to Black Basta.

Conclusion and security recommendations
Users can thwart new QAKBOT variants and other threats that spread through emails by following some of these best practices:
Verify the email sender and content before downloading attachments or selecting embedded links from emails.
Hover the pointer above embedded links to show the link’s target.
Check the sender’s identity. Unfamiliar email addresses, mismatched email and sender names, and spoofed company emails are some
of the signs that the sender has malicious intent.
If the email claims to come from a legitimate company, verify if they actually sent it before taking any action.

Organizations should take note of the trending use of Cobalt Strike in attacks, living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins), and red team or
penetration-testing tools, i.e. Brutel Ratel C4, to blend in with the environment.

Users can also protect systems through managed detection and response (MDR), which utilizes advanced artificial intelligence to correlate and
prioritize threats, determining if they are part of a larger attack. It can detect threats before they are executed, thus preventing further
compromise.

The constant resurgence of new, more sophisticated variants of known malware, as well as the emergence of entirely unknown threats,
demand solutions with advanced detection and response capabilities such as Trend Micro Vision One, a technology that can provide powerful
XDR capabilities that collect and automatically correlate data across multiple security layers — from email and endpoints to servers, cloud
workloads, and networks. Trend Micro Vision One can prevent attacks via automated protection, while also ensuring that no significant
incidents go unnoticed.
