Qakbot Malware Disrupted in International Cyber Takedown (DOJ National Press Release)

Information for Victims
Beginning on August 25, 2023, law enforcement gained access to the Qakbot botnet,
redirected botnet traffic to and through servers controlled by law enforcement, and instructed
Qakbot-infected computers to download a Qakbot Uninstall file that uninstalled Qakbot
malware from the infected computer. The Qakbot Uninstall file did not remediate other
malware that was already installed on infected computers; instead, it was designed to
prevent additional Qakbot malware from being installed on the infected computer by
untethering the victim computer from the Qakbot botnet.

Hash value for the Qakbot Uninstall file (SHA-256):

7cdee5a583eacf24b1f142413aabb4e556ccf4ef3a4764ad084c1526cc90e117

As a result of this operation, the FBI and the Dutch National Police have identified numerous
account credentials that were compromised by the Qakbot actors. The FBI has provided
those credentials to the website Have I Been Pwned, which is a free resource for people to
quickly assess whether their access credentials have been compromised in a data breach or

1/2



other activity. The Dutch National Police have also set up a website that contains information
about additional compromised credentials. You can check to see if your credentials were
compromised at the following websites:

This webpage will be updated as more resources become available. Victims are encouraged
to report the cybercrimes with their local FBI field office or the Internet Crime Complaint
Center (IC3) at ic3.gov.
