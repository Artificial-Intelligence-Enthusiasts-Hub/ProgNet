Babuk, an advanced ransomware strain, was publicly discovered in 2021. Since then, Avast
has blocked more than 5,600 targeted attacks, mostly in Brazil, Czech Republic, India, the
United States, and Germany.

Today, in cooperation with Cisco Talos and Dutch Police, Avast is releasing an updated
version of the Avast Babuk decryption tool, capable of restoring files encrypted by the
Babuk variant called Tortilla. To download the tool, click here.

Babuk Ransomware Decryptor 
In September 2021, the source code of the Babuk ransomware was released on a Russian-
speaking hacking forum. The ZIP file also contained 14 private keys (one for each victim).
Those keys were ECDH-25519 private keys needed for decryption of files encrypted by the
Babuk ransomware. 

The Tortilla Campaign 
After brief examination of the provided sample (originally named tortilla.exe), we found out
that the encryption schema had not changed since we analyzed Babuk samples 2 years
ago. The process of extending the decryptor was therefore straightforward. 

The Babuk encryptor was likely created from the leaked sources using the build tool.
According to Cisco Talos, a single private key is used for all victims of the Tortilla threat
actor. This makes the update to the decryptor especially useful, as all victims of the
campaign can use it to decrypt their files. As with all Avast decryptors, the Babuk
Ransomware Decryptor is available for free. 

Babuk victims can find out whether they were part of the Tortilla campaign by looking at the
extension of the encrypted files and the ransom note file. Files encrypted by the
ransomware have the .babyk extension as shown in the following example:

The ransom note file is called How To Restore Your Files.txt and is dropped to every
directory. This is how the ransom note looks like:

Babuk victims can download the Babuk Decryptor for free:

the NoMoreRansom project. 

We would like to thank Cisco Talos and the Dutch Police for the cooperation.
