Key points
Silent Push explores the extent of the Gamaredon Group’s fast flux operation.

300+ new apex domain IOCs discovered from a single Gamaredon domain.

Proprietary fingerprinting techniques used to expose the deployment of new attacker
infrastructure using wildcard A records

Background
Gamaredon - also known as Primitive Bear, Actinium or Shuckworm - are a Russian
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group that has been active since at least 2013,
historically across the US and the Indian Subcontinent, and more recently in Ukraine,
including reported attacks on Western government entities:

Gamaredon are a highly-belligerent threat group who deviate from the standard-hit and-run
tactics used by other APT groups, by propagating sustained attacks that are both heavily
obfuscated and uniquely aggressive.

Gamaredon TTPs
The group uses spear phishing and social engineering to deliver malware hidden within MS
Word documents:

Using MS Word combats static analysis by hosting the payload on a template that is
downloaded from an attacker-controlled server, once the document is opened and the user
has met one or more conditions - such as geographic location, device type and system
specification - prior to delivery.

A large amount of Gamaredon subdomains used in spear phishing attacks are linked
to the TLD .ru, registered via REGRU-RU and contain the number 71.

Use of fast fluxing
Gamaredon operates with an innumerable amount of IP addresses, and uses wildcard A
records in place of definable subdomains to evade detection in a technique known as fast
fluxing.

A large group of IPs are associated with a single Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN),
and rotated through an attack at an extremely high frequency via automated DNS resource
record (RR) amendments in the zone file.

Fast fluxing is used by APT groups to circumvent traditional methods of threat detection that
rely on threat feeds containing full domain names, including subdomains.

Rather than relying on lists of isolated IOCs, organizations need to deploy countermeasures
that track the underlying infrastructure that accommodates an attack - apex domains,
ASNs, registrars, authoritative nameservers etc. - and extrapolate correlative datasets that
allow security teams to identify patterns in attacker behaviour - ASN and IP diversity data,
naming conventions etc.

In order to defend themselves against fast flux TTPs, organizations need to identify and
block apex domains, regardless of the subdomain. Let’s take a look at how we used Silent
Push to do just that…

Deep dive: samiseto[.]ru

Every investigation begins with a series of observables. Several online sources have
reported recent attempts by Gamaredon to inject malware, using an MS Word template,
from the following domains:

Twitter post announcing malware hosted on samiseto[.]ru

Checking Virus Total confirms that the domains have been flagged as malicious, largely due
to the domains being reported on Twitter as post-breach intelligence:

We took one of the above domains - encyclopedia83.samiseto[.]ru (hosted on REGRU-RU)
- and analysed it by cross-referencing WHOIS information, IP diversity data, and reverse
lookups that laid bare a fresh list of domain IOCs:

Enriching encyclopedia83.samiseto[.]ru

We discovered 98 A records associated with *samiseto[.]ru, that were used in constant
rotation:

A record lookup for samiseto[.]ru

Further analysis revealed that IP addresses are used for no more than 4 days before being
substituted by a fresh IP (along with new subdomains), helping the threat actors to evade
detection and rendering most isolated IOCs obsolete upon discovery:

High IP diversity score

To extract actionable IOCs, we then created a list of all the IP addresses that a subdomain
of samiseto[.]ru has ever pointed to and applied a reverse lookup to uncover all domains
associated with those IPs, before matching the domains to threat activity using a series of
key indicators.

The results returned a list of 375 apex domains, which we used to populate our
Gamaredon early detection feed, available to Silent Push Enterprise customers

Use of wilcard records
We noticed that any string combination added before .samiseto[.]ru pointed to
5.44.42[.]154. After running a dig command, we were able to ascertain that attackers are
using a wildcard A record to point to the aforementioned domain:

IP diversity and ASN analysis
Using IP diversity data, we established that samiseto[.]ru has pointed to 15 IP addresses
within a 30-day period, all of them bar one being hosted on the the Russian ASN GIR-AS,
RU (207713), with the remainder hosted via Kazakhstan on IT-GRAD, KZ (212819):

Whilst the majority of IPs over a 90-day period were traced back to GIR-AS RU, we
discovered that DIGITALOCEAN US, the New York-based cloud services organization, was
also used:

Using Silent Push to combat Gamaredon’s fast flux techniques
Our Threat Analysts used IP/ANS diversity data and advanced DNS fingerprinting
techniques to reveal the extent of Gamaredon’s fast flux infrastructure, and populate an
early detection feed with hundreds of unique malicious apex domains, using a single
reported subdomain as the target IOC.

Silent Push Enterprise users are able to ingest curated threat feeds containing IOCs related
to the Gamaredon group’s fast flux infrastructure using the tags #russo, #gamaredon and
#apt.

The Silent Push Community Edition also contains many of the lookups that we used in our
research. Sign up here for free.
