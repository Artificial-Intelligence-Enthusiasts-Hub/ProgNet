Ducktail is a malware family that has been active since the second half of 2021 and aims to
steal Facebook business accounts. WithSecure and GridinSoft have covered Ducktail
attacks: the infostealer spread under the guise of documents relating to well-known
companies’ and brands’ projects and products. Both public reports attribute the Ducktail
attacks to a group that presumably hails from Vietnam. We have analyzed a recent campaign
that ran between March and early October 2023 and targeted marketing professionals. An
important feature that sets it apart is that, unlike previous campaigns, which relied on .NET
applications, this one used Delphi as the programming language.

Infection
The campaign saw the bad actor send out an archive containing images of new products by
bona fide companies along with a malicious executable disguised with a PDF icon. When
started, the malware would open a real, embedded PDF file that contained the job details.

The attack was tailored to target marketing professionals looking for a career change. The
choice of victims and the distinctive means used by the threat actor led us to assume early
on that the campaign was about spreading a new version of Ducktail.

The malware would install a browser extension capable of stealing Facebook business and
ads accounts, likely for subsequent sale.

Ducktail and the malicious extension
We examined a large number of archives from the latest campaign: in each case, a copy of
Ducktail was emailed in the name of a major clothing company.

The contents of the malicious archive

If opened by an interested victim, the malicious file saves a PowerShell script named
param.ps1 and a PDF decoy locally to C:\Users\Public. The script uses the default PDF
viewer on the device to open the decoy, pauses for five minutes, and then terminates the
Chrome browser process.

While the script stands by, the parent executable saves a malicious library named libEGL.dll
to C:\Users\Public\Libraries\ and then loads it. When launched, the library goes over every
LNK file that it finds in:

C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\,
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar\,

and on the desktop, altering the launch string for all Chromium-based browsers (Google
Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave) by adding the following code: --load-
extension="C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User
Data\fjoaledfpmneenckfbpdfhkmimnjocfa"

Some of the library strings required for the malicious code to run are encrypted with the AES-
CBC key “gnghfn47n467n43b” and the initialization vector “dakfhskljh92384h”.

In addition to launching the library, the parent file saves malicious browser extension files to
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User
Data\fjoaledfpmneenckfbpdfhkmimnjocfa. The extension disguises itself with the Google
Docs Offline icon and description text, while the directory that features in the path
(fjoaledfpmneenckfbpdfhkmimnjocfa) is used by the bona fide extension NordVPN. It is worth
noting that other variants of the malware may use different paths to host the extension.

extension (right)

The core exception script is obfuscated. It constantly sends the details of all open browser
tabs to the command-and-control (C&C) server, and if detecting Facebook-related URLs,
checks for ads and business accounts to try and steal them. In particular, the extension
snatches cookies and details of accounts that the victim is signed in to on the device. To
bypass two-factor authentication, the extension uses Facebook API requests and Vietnam’s
2fa[.]live service, which offers various auxiliaries for generating one-time access codes,
among other things. This is probably how the hackers log in after the user’s authentication
session has expired. Stolen credentials and cookies are forwarded to a C&C server
registered in Vietnam.

Malicious file usage flowchart

In this campaign, in addition to the main script, the malware would save to the extension
folder a script named jquery-3.3.1.min.js, a corrupted version of the core script from prior
attacks.

DuckTail attack geography
According to our telemetry, cybercriminals most often attacked users in India. Our solutions
also stopped infection attempts on devices of users in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Germany,
Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Jordan, Pakistan, Vietnam, UAE, USA, Peru and Chile.
