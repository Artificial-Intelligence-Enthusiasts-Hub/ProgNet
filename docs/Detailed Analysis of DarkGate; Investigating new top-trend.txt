— Privilege Escalation using CVE-2021–1733 or Process Hollowing

— Persistence Management for DarkGate itself

Darkgate needs to be kept track as features are continuously added and detection bypasses occur.

Introduction
Recently, cybercriminals had a new interest in loader/botnet malware called DarkGate. DarkGate has
been developed since 2017 and is being sold as MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service) by a user named
RastaFarEye, who is active in underground forums such as Exploit.in and XSS.is.

DarkGate was not widely used until 2021, although it was first released in 2018. However, DarkGate has
gained demand by updating new features such as Loader, Miner, Remote Control, and Info-stealer. Also,
they keep applying anti-analysis or bypass detection by monitoring the analysis report of DarkGate.

Figure 2. Patch note of DarkGate related to anti-analysis (Exploit. in)

DarkGate is sold as Malware-as-a-Service at XSS.is and Exploit.in, priced at $1,000 per day, $15,000 per
month, and $100,000 per year. They set a limit of 10 clients per month to keep their project secret but
recently increased to 30 due to demand increases.

Figure 3. Notice of increase in sales limit (Exploit.in)

Various threat actors such as TA577, Ducktail, UNC2975, and UNC5085 buy and utilize Darkgate in their
attacks, which makes DarkGate distribute in various forms. Not only the well-known methods such as
torrent or phishing mail but recently, some abuse the search engine’s AD system to make their phishing
site appear on top of the results to make victims access it and download DarkGate. DarkGate’s various
functions and detection bypass methods are continuously updated due to the active activities of creators
and purchase attack groups, so periodic tracking of function updates is necessary.

Information of RastaFarEye
The contact information revealed by RastaFarEye is as follows,

Figure 4. Banned RastaFarEye account profile (Exploit.in)

Currently, on the Exploit.in, RastaFarEye has been banned after receiving a report from a user for not
notifying that Packing (also called Crypto) is not applied by default when selling DarkGate. Nevertheless,
since RastaFarEye has an account on XSS.is, we are expecting that they will continue their action in
XSS.is.

Detailed Analysis
In this section, we describe the structure of DarkGate and detailed analysis of its features. First, we will
explain the process of how DarkGate is distributed and installed, and then we will explain the functions
that DarkGate has.

The analysis mentioned in our report is based on the analysis of the files below. Based on the
configuration settings previously published by Trellix, this sample is identified as V5.

SHA256: 1fb6b8bed3a67ee4225f852c3d90fd2b629f2541ab431b4bd4d9d9f5bbd2c4b7

1. Distribution Type
DarkGate is mostly distributed in two forms; VBScript or Windows Installer Package(MSI). In the recent
version of DarkGate, actors prefer MSI form since Windows deprecated VBScript.

Figure 5. Execution Flow of DarkGate in VBScript Form (downloaded via PAPERTEAR)

DarkGate, distributed in VBScript form, was delivered through messengers such as E-mail or Skype.
Those cases try to trick victims by making the dropper/downloader look like a document file such as
using an LNK file, or adding spaces like “filename.pdf<spaces>www.skype.vbs". When the victim
executes it, it downloads the Autoit script file and Autoit launcher from the server. Autoit script contains
the XOR encrypted bytecode, which will be decrypted and injected into other processes. The VBS file
that uses this method is named PAPERTAR, which is used by UNC2975.

Not much different from VBScript, recent DarkGate has an additional stage to execute Autoit script using
DLL Side-loading to bypass the anti-virus detection.

Figure 6. Execution Flow of DarkGate in MSI Form

In the DLL Side-loading stage, pure EXE files in the wild and malicious DLL file pairs such as windbg.exe
and malicious dbgeng.dll or KeyScrambler.exe and KeyScrambler.dll are used. Malicious DLL reads
`data.bin`, which is extracted from MSI, and gets an additional payload to decrypt `data2.bin`, which
contains AutoIt launcher and Autoit script. The rest of the process is the same as VBScript.

AutoIT script executes bytecode by callback of EnumWindows to execute DarkGate. The structure of the
bytecode is shown below.

   90   nop
   E9 B9 03  00 00 jmp MZ_HEADER

MZ_HEADER:    4D   dec ebp  ; ‘M’ - DOS header magic 1    5A   pop edx  ; ‘Z’ - DOS header magic 
2    45   inc ebp  ; Restore stack status    52   push edx  ;    E8 00 00 00 00 call $  ; push 
eip    58   pop eax  ; eax = MZ_HEADER + 0x9    83 E8 09  sub eax, 0x9 ; eax = MZ_HEADER    50   
push eax  ; function call argument set    05 00 B0 00 00 add eax, 0xb000 ; eax = PE_LOADER = 
MZ_HEADER + 0xb000    FF D0  call eax  ; PE_LOADER(MZ_HEADER);    C3   ret…PE_LOADER:    … ; Load 
and Execute the PE data

Executed code extracts and decrypts the encrypted DarkGate in the script.au3 file and execute it.

2. Characteristics of DarkGate

3/13



In this section, we describe the characteristics of DarkGate.

Custom BASE64
DarkGate encodes important constant strings in binary or data in C2 communication with Base64.
However, DarkGate uses Base64 different table shown below.

zLAxuU0kQKf3sWE7ePRO2imyg9GSpVoYC6rhlX48ZHnvjJDBNFtMd1I5acwbqT+=

Configuration
DarkGate loads configuration saved in binary. In the case of the C2 server address, it is encoded in
custom Base64. Other DarkGate settings are stored as plain text in the binary or encoded through
Custom Base64. Plain DarkGate settings are formed as follows,

0=23511=Yes2=Yes3=No5=No4=100...

In each line, based on the equal sign, the setting key value is on the left, and the value assigned to the
setting key is on the right. The meaning of the values stored in each setting key value is as shown in the
table below, and there are a total of 30 values.

Table 1. DarkGate Configurations

Note that some of the settings can be changed or deprecated by updates of DartGate. In the case of
“Unknown”, in DarkGate v4 and v5 versions, the purpose of the use is not found or the type of storage
and use are different.

Vaccine Detection
DarkGate detects installed anti-virus into ten types listed below.

Table 2. Targeted vaccine list

In addition to the vaccines included in the above 10 categories, DartGate detects additional vaccines as
shown below, but the actual malicious actions performed do not change.

Avira, Trend Micro, McAfee, SUPER AntiSpyware, Comodo, ByteFence, Search & Destroy, 360
Total Security, Total AV, IObit Malware Fighter, Emsisoft, QuickHeal, F-Secure, G Data
In the case of IObit Malware Fighter, DarkGate kills monitor.exe and smBootTime.exe repeatedly.

Initialize
If option 1 in DarkGate configuration is Yes, to maintain continuity, perform one of the following actions
depending on the type of installed vaccine.

1. Register the LNK file that runs the malicious AU3 script as AutoIt3.exe in the startup program.
2. Register the LNK file to Run the Register.

If Bitdefender (1), Quick Heal (6), Kaspersky (9), or KES (10) mentioned above are installed and the LNK
file or registry that runs DarkGate does not exist, DarkGate shuts down the infected computer. If the
Bitdefender (1) exists, it uses NtRaiseHardError with the STATUS_HOST_DOWN error code to cause a

4/13



BSOD on the infected computer. According to the author’s post, it appears to have been implemented to
copy to a safe path and shut down the device when it is recognized as being detected by an antivirus.

Figure 7. Patch note of DarkGate persistence (Exploit.in)

C2 Communication
DarkGate uses HTTP POST requests to communicate with the C2 server. At this time, a custom Base64
table different from the one mentioned above is used for the data. The process of how DarkGate creates
the final body data for C2 is as follows.

1. Calculate `MD5(<Username> + <Computer Name> + <Product ID> + <Processor Name>)`
2. HEX encodes and applies substitute cipher to hash value (Substitute cipher table:

0123456789ABCDEF -> abcdefKhABCDEFGH)
3. Add every byte in step 2’s result.
4. Set the random seed with step 3’s result, and mix Custom Base64 table based on the random

seed.

Here, the data to be sent is encoded using the newly created Base64 table, and the string calculated in
step 2 is attached to the encoded data and sent together.

Request & Response
After all initial processes are completed, DarkGate periodically requests commands from the C2 server.
DarkGate transmits data in the following format. Note that the entire data is encrypted using the newly
created Base64 table.

1000|<Elapsed time since execution(sec)>|<Version of DarkGate>|<Permission>|22|

Then C2 identifies the client through the data and sends and controls the data as follows.

<4 digits command id><encrypted data>

The command is executed according to the received 4-digit number, and if data is required according to
the command, it is encrypted and transmitted through a newly created Base64 table.

3. DarkGate Commands
We now talk about the malicious actions that DarkGate can do. Because there are too many commands
that C2 can send, we categorized those commands for better explanation. Note that each command's
availability or command ID can be different between versions of DarkGate.

Keylogging
Keylogging executes immediately after initial setup, regardless of the C2 command. The results are
saved in a file in DD-MM-YYYY.log format, and the storage path varies depending on the version. C2 can
retrieve or delete stored keylogs as needed.

Steal Credentials
We can see that software created by NirSoft is used to steal various types of information. The existence
of lol.exe used in the 1011 and 1012 commands could not be confirmed in the sample, but usage of
/shtml and /stext argument in command among the software made by NirSoft and the skype.txt file name.
It can be assumed that it is SkypeLogView that steals Skype information.

Table 6. Commands related to stealing credentials

Remove Data/Backups
DarkGate performs various malicious actions by utilizing programs or processes related to the browser.
Here, the above function appears to exist to delete APPDATA related to the browser used and left behind
by the malicious code. It is also believed that there is a function to delete restore points to prevent
restoration to the time before infection.

Table 7. Commands related to removing data/backups

Privilege Escalation
DarkGate attempts to escalate privileges in two ways. One method is using PsExec to obtain SYSTEM
privileges(CVE-2021–1733), and the other method is the Process Hollowing method.

Table 8. Commands related to privilege escalation

Crypto Mining
Analysis of related binary was not possible because additional downloaded data could not be received.
Besides, we could get a clue by analyzing through information existing in DarkGate. Cryptocurrency
mining supported by DarkGate uses XMRig to support mining using CPU and GPU and to mine Monero.

Inspect Network
These functions trigger proxies to steal internet communication by setting up these registers.

GUI Control
DarkGate supports remote control through the display. Attackers can use virtual display via Hidden VNC
or Hidden AnyDesk, or use the originally installed display. It also can hide the process by running on top
of the browser process.

Table 11. Commands related to remote display

Reverse Shell
DarkGate also supports the use of traditional reverse shells. However, interaction with the reverse shell
must be done through DarkGate and can be transmitted through command 1467. The shell executed
here uses the shell written in the environment variable COMSPEC.

Table 12. Commands related to reverse shell

Run & Manage Processes
DarkGate supports various ways to execute code or programs. Not only just launching them, but also
DarkGate supports Code Injection, Process Hollowing, and PPID spoofing to avoid detection.

Table 13. Commands related to processes

Managing DarkGate
Attackers can enable the test mode of some functions or debug messages to check DarkGate status.
Also, it is possible to update or remove DarkGate remotely.

Table 14. Commands related to the DarkGate setting

ETC
Depending on the system situation, there are functions supported by DarkGate to interrupt the user or
maintain operation. To terminate the monitor, it uses the SC_MONITORPOWER message in
SendMessageA. Disabling sleep mode uses SetThreadExecutionState to prevent sleep mode.

Table 15. ETC commands

Conclusion
DarkGate is a malware that, when installed on a target computer, allows attackers to perform
various commands such as information theft, cryptocurrency mining, and execution of arbitrary
programs.
Darkgate first appeared in 2017 and is sold only to a small number of attack groups in the form of
Malware-as-a-Service through underground forums.
DarkGate continues to update it by adding features and fixing bugs based on analysis results from
security researchers and vendors.
On the fact that the structure and function of malware are continuously changing, it is expected that
tracking these changes will be necessary to prevent damage.
