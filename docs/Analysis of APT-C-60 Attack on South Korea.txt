#ThreatBook Security Incident Analysis Report

Summary
APT-C-60 is disclosed by domestic security vendors in 2021. It is reported that the earliest
attack time can be traced back to 2018 and the attack targets human resources and trade-
related institutions including China. Recent monitoring by ThreatBook Intelligence Research
and Response Team found that the Group has been active since December 2021. In June
this year, the Group launched targeted attacks on targets in S. Korea. With analysis of the
attacks, the findings are as follows:

The targets of this batch of attacks include Dr. Bernhard Seliger, the representative of
the Hanns Seidel Stiftung, and politicians who may be related to the 2022 Pyeong
Chang Peace Forum.
Two time nodes of this attack: attack on the politicians related to the 2022 Pyeong
Chang Peace Forum in early February 2022; targeted attack on Dr. Bernhard Seliger in
mid-June 2022. Both are spear-mail type attacks.
The network assets used by attacker for payload hosting attack and C&C
communication include public free cloud storage sites (such as bitbucket.org,
statcounter.com) and attacker private C&C assets. Trojan back link address is to
involve multiple url addresses of these two types.
ThreatBook extracts multiple related IOCs though the traceability analysis of related
samples, IPS, and domain names, which can be used for threat intelligence detection.
TDP, TIP, API, OneDNS, OneEDR of ThreatBook have all supported the detection of
this attack activity and group.

 

Details
On June 20, 2022, the spear-mail delivered to seliger@hss.de is as follows. The attacker
pretended it to be a Korean graduate student’s thesis defense to induce the target person to
download malicious files hosted on cloud.mail.ru.

The downloaded file is a rar compressed file, containing bait file and malicious lnk files. The
bait files related to the thesis are as follows (The Chinese environment of the office causes
the Korean to display abnormally).

图片无替代文字
According to the machine ID in the Lnk file attribute information: desktop-iag9k61, we also
found attack on the early stage of the Pyeong Chang Peace Forum in February 2022 by
APT-C-60. The bait file used is as follows.

In the two attacks, the bitbucket.org site used for payload hosting and file uploading
included user IDs: grand9_neat, Miravos, sorakas. Storage files related to the current
attack have been deleted.

Sample Analysis
The payload execution process in the attack is as follows. Starting from the downloaded
compressed file, the persistence payload is to be divided into three parts: Lnk file with
malicious download, downloader Trojan (mssysmon.db) with file information acquisition and
download execution, remote-control Trojan (TaskControler.dll) with file stealing, plug-in
loading, and shell function. Subsequent sections are to analyze the three types of
components.

Malware Lnk
Taking “Online questionnaire-Exploring ways to cooperate with North Korea.docx.lnk” as an
example, the sample information is as follows

图片无替代文字
The command-line of Lnk file is as follows. Call mshta to execute remote javascript.

图片无替代文字
Javascript resource jumps through the html index code.

图片无替代文字
Obfuscated javascript code after the jump is as follows.

This js code downloads the next-stage malicious resource from the C&C server , decrypts it
and then moves it to %appdata%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\UserData\Temp\mssysmon.db.

图片无替代文字
From the download file retrieval code, the existing default download file extensions include
“.dib”, “.bmp”. Currently C&C can only download bmp files.

By jacking the COM object whose CLSID is 603D3801-BD81-11d0-A3A5-00C04FD706EC,
the persistence of the landing Trojan is realized. The CLSID is bound to the service named
“shared task scheduler”, which is related to Windows scheduled tasks, and its registered dll
component is loaded when os starts.

mssysmon.db
Taking “mssysmon.db” as an example to analyze, the sample information is as follows.

图片无替代文字
Analyze the landing mssysmon.db file, which is dll file, and the core function is provided by
tdstart export function. Before running Trojan, control the unique instance running by creating
an event object named “673304C7B2797C3676B6”.

图片无替代文字
Decrypt the C&C configuration, which contains multiple URL address. The Trojan heartbeat
interval is 6 hours.

图片无替代文字
The Trojan creates the %AppData%\Microsoft\HTML Help directory as the directory for
subsequent plug-in distribution and log storage. The Trojan acquires the host name,
username, os version, and uses AEC encryption to send it to C&C server to go online. AES
key is “8394M8YRRNK2EJRA” in the previous decryption configuration file.

图片无替代文字
Traverse c:\Program Files\ directory, acquire file directory information, and send it to the C&C
server. C&C target address includes two as follows: http://162.222.214.50/temp/sourcea.php,
https://c.statcounter.com/12733057/0/f9b868f1/1/.

Traverse the %AppData%\Microsoft\HTML Help directory, delete the .mui file and load
msiobj.dll file. If the msiobj.dll file does not exist, then download it again. The download
address includes: http://185.207.206.108/premium/P1/HTBXTDQJJHMI.bmp,
https://bitbucket.org/grand9_neat/well/downloads/19132.bmp,
https://bitbucket.org/grand9_neat/well/downloads/19164.bmp.

图片无替代文字
The loading logic in the %AppData%\Microsoft\HTML Help directory is as follows. Rename
the downloaded and decrypted msiobjs.dll to msiobj0.dll, and then load and call
msiobj0.dll!ExtFunc. if it fails, change the dll extension to mui, and delete the mui file.

TaskControler.dll
Taking “TaskControler.dll” as an example to analyze, the sample information is as follows.

图片无替代文字
The Trojan is a 64-bit dll component developed by C++. TaskControler.dll!extension provides
core function.

图片无替代文字
In the initialization phase of the C++ object, start “83a078f58a078f7a88f37g0gf8a873a8” to
perform the “xor 2 -1” operation to obtain the RC4 key
“90b149c69b149c4b99c04d1dc9b940b9”, which is to be used for the encryption and
decryption of the communication field in the subsequent C&C communication.

图片无替代文字
Before running the Trojan, control the unique instance running by using the mutex
“9ABKD3409ABACL6SGHDG404HNJ0”.

图片无替代文字
Open the %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Vault\UserProfileRoamings directory. If it does not
exist, create the directory and set it to be hidden.

图片无替代文字
After that, the Trojan traverses the
%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Vault\UserProfileRoamings directory ， and runs the attack
payload in this directory according to the file extension.

Decrypt C&C 160.20.147.118. Send https://api.ipify.org/ request to obtain the internet IP.
Acquire information of host and user into the core Trojan work logic. When it is detected and
judged that the system has been started for more than 6 hours, the main thread is to go
online with C&C, set a ten-minute heartbeat interval, and schedule working thread by event
object signals.

图片无替代文字
The working thread is composed of five independent threads which respectively complete
the corresponding functions: task request, result feedback, screen monitoring, file stealing,
RAT.

图片无替代文字
The debugging environment Trojan online packet is as follows.

图片无替代文字
The data in the body with the form of "a001=*&a002=*&a003=*&a004=*" is partially parsed
as follows.

图片无替代文字
There are also post data packets of “b001=*&b002=*&b003=*&b004=*”,
“c001=*&c002=*&c003=*&c004=*” type in the Trojan communication, which respectively
represent to parse the URL issued by the C&C for downloading action and file uploading.

In the file uploading part, there are some differences in the processing of screenshot files
and file content: the screenshot files are encoded by base64 and converted to decimal
strings; the file content is first encrypted with RC4 and then converted to decimal strings.

图片无替代文字 图片无替代文字
By parsing C&C commands, the RAT distribution thread can achieve the functions such as
file directory traversal, disk information acquisition, process termination, DLL loading,
screenshot, downloading, process execution, file or directory deletion and cmd shell.

图片无替代文字 图片无替代文字
The full RAT parsing is as follows.

图片无替代文字
Support encrypted file download. The download file landing path is temp%\wcts66889.tmp,
which needs to be decrypted by AES. AES128 key={21 A4 47 12 68 5A 8B A4 29 85 78 3B
67 88 39 99}。

图片无替代文字
The C&C receives shell, transfers it through the local named pipe “\\.\pipe\async_pipe”, and
then executes it starting with cmd.

Association Analysis
This sample is basically the same as the execution process of the landing payload in the
previous APT-C-60 attack. The third-stage component TaskControler.dll is the same as the
historical attack with same export function and same code behavior and communication
process. The following figure is a screenshot of the historical attack time analysis of the APT-
C-60, in which the forgery payload component directory and payload traversal loading logic
in the DLL payload export function “extension”, “%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\” are
exactly the same. Therefore, it is more credible to attribute this attack sample to APT-C-60.
