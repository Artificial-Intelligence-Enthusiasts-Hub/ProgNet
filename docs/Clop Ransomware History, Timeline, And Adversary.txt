What is Clop Ransomware
The infamous Clop ransomware, mainly known as Cl0p, targets various industries and
organizations, extorting data for a considerable ransom. It advances actively with new
emerging campaigns. The Clop ransomware is associated with the Russian threat group
TA505, which primarily operates as a (RaaS) ransomware-as-a-service. It is also seen that
the threat group has been using various zero-day exploits for its campaigns, which include
the latest Moveit Transfer exploitation. The ransomware is primarily Cryptomix ransomware,
making its first appearance in 2019.

History
Clop ransomware mainly targets victims through spear-phishing campaigns, primarily
focusing on the banking, healthcare, and finance sectors. The banking sector experiences
the highest number of campaigns. On the contrary, the threat group avoids targeting the
healthcare sector out of humanitarian considerations. However, the healthcare sector is still
affected by its campaigns. The ransomware is also specific in targeting countries such as the
USA, Canada, and most parts of the Asia Pacific. The most affected countries are the USA,
Canada, and India, all falling victim to these campaigns.

The ransomware is observed exploiting numerous zero-day vulnerabilities with different
variations. Installing DEWMODE, a webshell, was initially detected on FTA servers by exploiting
zero-days. Recently, it was also observed exploiting the MOVEIT Transfer vulnerability,
which is an MFT with a SQL injection vulnerability. These exploits were primarily used to
exfiltrate data from databases and install webshells, granting the threat actors complete
control over the affected endpoints. In a new campaign launched by the threat group, they
are seen exploiting GOAnywhere (MFT) using a zero-day vulnerability.

The ransomware actively targets various organizations, and it has been observed since late
2020 that the threat actors have compromised over 100 companies. In collaboration with
Fin11, a financially motivated threat group, they exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the File
Transfer Appliance (FTA) of Kiteworks (formerly known as Accellion). It is important to note
that no data was encrypted; however, the threat actors threatened to expose millions of user
data on the black market. The Clop ransomware was primarily used to exfiltrate the data.
Additionally, the threat actors maintain a blog providing updates on their recent activities.
They also operate a market selling data from various organizations for financial gain.

Clop Ransomware Timeline
1. February 2019: First noticed in the wild with large-scale spear phishing.
2. January 2020: Fin11 deployed Clop ransomware on the File Transfer Appliance (FTA)

of Kiteworks, formerly Accellion.
3. April 2020: The Clop ransomware threat group gained access to a pharmaceutical

company and leaked their user data.
4. November 2021: Maritime services in Singapore fell prey to the Clop ransomware,

exfiltrating sensitive information regarding commercial details and employee data,
including bank details.

5. November 2021: Security researchers discovered Clop ransomware exploiting the
SolarWinds vulnerability, breaching several organizations.

6. April 2022: Security researchers discovered several MOVEit Transfer servers were
compromised, which had sensitive information.

7. June 2023: Several companies from various sectors were compromised, including US
federal agencies, BBC, hospitals, and EY.

Clop Ransomware Infection chain

2/10



The infection chain of the Clop ransomware involves the following stages:

1. Initial Access: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application T1566 - Phishing The initial
access is achieved through spear-phishing victims, often accompanied by the SDBot
and FlawedAmmy RAT. The ransomware also exploits various applications using zero-
days and known CVEs for gaining initial access. Additionally, compromised RDP
credentials are utilized as another entry point.

2. Execution: T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell T1059.003 -
Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell T1129 - Shared
Modules The ransomware predominantly utilizes native APIs and command
interpreters like Windows PowerShell and Visual Basic macros for executing
commands.

3/10



3. Persistence: T1505.003 - Server Software Component: Web Shell T1546.011 - Event
Triggered Execution: Application Shimming The ransomware ensures persistence by
being executed during system autostart. It also modifies system processes to evade
detection and maintain persistence.

4. Privilege Escalation: T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation T1548.002 - Abuse
Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control To escalate privileges, the
ransomware employs commonly exploited techniques, including UAC bypass and
leveraging publicly available CVEs.

5. Defense Evasion: T1055 - Process Injection T1070 - Indicator Removal T1574.002 -
Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading The ransomware utilizes sophisticated
defense evasion techniques. It masquerades as a legitimate process by using valid
known signatures. It terminates security controls present on the endpoint and employs
process injection to evade detection. Furthermore, it clears the event logs on the
infected system.

6. Discovery: T1018 - Remote System Discovery The ransomware scans the endpoint for
various files to encrypt and exfiltrate. It also searches for other endpoints connected to
the network and identifies processes to check for security controls, terminating them if
found.

7. Command and Control: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol T1105 - Ingress Tool
Transfer Clop ransomware predominantly utilizes Cobalt Strike for its command and
control operations. It frequently sends beacons to actively monitor the infected
systems.

8. Impact: T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact The ransomware encrypts data using a
1024-bit RSA and RC4 key. The encrypted data may be exfiltrated for sale on dark
markets, unless the victims comply with the threat actor's demands. Additionally, all
shadow volumes are deleted to prevent data recovery.

Clop ransomware targetting the MOVEIT Transfer vulnerability
Clop ransomware specifically targets the MOVEIT Transfer vulnerability, an application
designed to facilitate efficient management of file transfer operations within organizations.
The threat actors took advantage of a SQL injection vulnerability present in the web
application of MOVEIT Transfer. They exploited this vulnerability by installing a webshell
known as LEMURLOOT. Furthermore, the webshell incorporated various libraries from Moveit
and primarily focused on enumerating and retrieving data from the underlying databases.
This exploit not only enabled the threat actors to exfiltrate sensitive data but also gave them
the ability to execute malicious code. The situation is particularly worrisome as it has been
observed that more than 2000 servers are still utilizing the vulnerable version of the MOVEIT
Transfer application, rendering them active targets for the threat actor.
