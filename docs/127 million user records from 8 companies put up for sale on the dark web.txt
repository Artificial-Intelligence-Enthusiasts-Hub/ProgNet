The same individual sold 620 million user accounts from 16 other companies earlier this week.

An individual who earlier this week was selling 620 million user records stolen from 16 companies has now put up a second batch of hacked
data totaling 127 million, originating from eight companies.

The data is currently being sold on Dream Market, a dark web marketplace where crooks sell an assortment of illegal products, such as user
data, drugs, weapons, malware, and others.

The individual selling the data goes by the name of Gnosticplayers, and it's currently unclear if they're the one/ones who hacked the 24
companies, or just a third-party who purchased the data from the real hacker and is now re-selling it for a bigger profit.

According to tech news site TechCrunch, who first reported this new batch of hacked accounts going for sale on Dream Market, Gnosticplayers
is asking for roughly four bitcoin, which is about $14,500 in fiat currency. Prices vary depending on the quality of the user data and the difficulty
in cracking password hashes.

This second batch of hacked accounts includes data from the following companies:

Of the companies listed above, Houzz had already come clean about its data breach last week. The other seven companies did not publicly
reveal any security breaches before the publication of today's ads.

This new batch of stolen databases comes after earlier this week, the same Dream Market user was selling the following user databases from
16 other companies:

Animoto, MyFitnessPal and MyHeritage previously disclosed breaches last year. DataCamp, 500px, Dubsmash, EyeEm, Artsy, 8fit, and
CoffeeMeetsBagel confirmed this week that they've been breached as well, giving credence to the seller's boast that this is real data and not
just a scam.

These 16 databases are no longer available for sale now. Gnosticplayers said he took them down after buyers complained that a prolonged
sale would eventually lead to some of these databases leaking online, and becoming available to everyone.

More updates to follow as we're still looking at the data.
