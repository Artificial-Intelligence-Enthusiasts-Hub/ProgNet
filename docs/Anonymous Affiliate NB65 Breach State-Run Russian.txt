The data leaked by the Anonymous affiliate group contains 4,000 files and more than 900,000
emails from Russian state-run television and radio broadcaster VGTRK (aka All-Russia State
Television and Radio Broadcasting Company).
NB65 (Network Battalion 65) is a hacker group linked with the Anonymous hacktivist
collective. The group claims to have breached the servers of Russian state-run television
and radio broadcaster called the “All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting
Company” (VGTRK).

Anonymous’ Twitter account (@YourAnonTV) also tweeted about the hack on their handle
this week, revealing that hackers have leaked around 800 GB of data online.

Anonymous-linked group ‘NB65’ ( @xxNB65 ) released via #DDoSecrets over 20 years
and 900K emails from VGTRK, a Russian, state-owned broadcaster which operates 5
national TV stations, 2 international networks, 5 radio stations, and over 80 regional TV
and radio networks.

Hackers Leak 786GB Worth of Data
VGTRK is Russia’s largest media corporation and manages dozens of national and regional
television and radio stations and online channels in Russia and other languages. According
to NB65, they hacked the All-Russia State TV a few days after Anonymous
announced hacking of the Central Bank of Russia and leaked 22GB worth of data online.

What Data Was Stolen?
According to a tweet from Emma Best, journalist, and co-founder of a non-profit
whistleblower organization DDoSecrets, the data provided by the hackers is more than 800
GB, and the total comes to 786.2GB after “de-duplication” and sorting.

Best wrote that apart from over 900,000 emails, the data contains more than 4,000
documents stolen from VGTRK’s cloud service. The files mostly comprise media clips and
assets. It is worth noting that its primary assets include TV channels Russia-1, Russia 24,
and RTR Planeta.

On the other hand, @YourAnonNews, one of the largest social media representatives of the
Anonymous movement urged people to download the data from the DDoSecrets website via
torrent and translate the leaked emails.
