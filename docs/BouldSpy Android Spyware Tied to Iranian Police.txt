BouldSpy: Android Spyware Tied to Iranian Police
Targets Minorities

Lookout

Researchers at the Lookout Threat Lab have discovered a new Android surveillance tool
which we attribute with moderate confidence to the Law Enforcement Command of the
Islamic Republic of Iran (FARAJA). Named BouldSpy for the “BoulderApplication” class
which configures the tool’s command and control (C2), we have been tracking the spyware
since March 2020. Starting in 2023, the malware has drawn the attention of security
researchers on Twitter and by others in the threat intelligence community characterizing it as
an Android botnet and ransomware. While BouldSpy includes ransomware code, Lookout
researchers assess that it is unused and nonfunctional, but could indicate ongoing
development or an attempt at misdirection on the part of the actor.

Based on our analysis of exfiltrated data from C2 servers for the spyware, BouldSpy has
victimized more than 300 people, including minority groups such as Iranian Kurds, Baluchis,
Azeris, and possibly Armenian Christian groups. The evidence we have gathered implies that
the spyware may also have been used in efforts to counter and monitor illegal trafficking
activity related to arms, drugs, and alcohol. 

We believe FARAJA uses physical access to devices, likely obtained during detention, to
install BouldSpy to further monitor the target on release. In our research, we obtained and
reviewed a large quantity of exfiltrated data that included photos and device

communications, such as screenshots of conversations, recordings of video calls, as well as
SMS logs. Our analysis also revealed photos of drugs, firearms, and official FARAJA
documents that indicate potential law enforcement use of the malware. However, much of
the victim data points to its broader usage, which indicates targeted surveillance efforts
towards minorities within Iran. Notably, much of the malware’s activities occurred during the
height of the Mahsa Amini protests in late 2022.

Recovered exfiltration data from BouldSpy’s C2 server indicates that initial infection for some
victims takes place in close proximity to Iranian police stations or border patrol checkpoints,
where detention and physical access to mobile devices could be obtained.
We believe BouldSpy to be a new malware family based on the relatively small number of
samples that we’ve obtained, as well as the lack of maturity around its operational security,
such as unencrypted C2 traffic, hardcoded plaintext C2 infrastructure details, a lack of string
obfuscation, and failure to conceal or remove intrusion artifacts. Until now, to the best of our
knowledge the apps that we discovered and described in this article were never distributed
through Google Play.

BouldSpy represents yet another surveillance tool taking advantage of the personal nature of
mobile devices. The spyware is especially concerning given Iran's human rights track record.
Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security and Lookout Life customers are protected from this threat. 

Deployment and capabilities
The first locations exfiltrated from the victims are, with few exceptions, concentrated near
Iranian provincial police stations, Iranian Cyber Police stations, Law Enforcement Command
facilities, and border control posts. Based on this, we theorize that a victim’s device is
confiscated once detained or arrested, and then subsequently physically infected with
BouldSpy.

Recovered exfiltration data hints that victims came into contact with Iranian law enforcement.
The FARAJA actor provides user friendly features on its C2 panel to perform device
management of victims and build new custom BouldSpy malware applications, with the
malware operator able to choose between a default package name of
“com.android.callservice” (posing as an Android system service related to handling phone
calls), or can trojanize various legitimate applications by inserting the
“com.android.callservice” package. By setting up operations in this way, Iranian police
officers or other personnel that have low technical skills can easily generate new malware
samples, which makes it easier to ramp up deployment operations with minimal training.

Some of the apps BouldSpy impersonates include CPU-Z, a mobile CPU benchmarking tool,
Currency Converter Pro, a Persian-language interest calculator, and an app named Fake
Call which is a prank app that generates fake phone calls or text messages. In April 2023,
we also acquired a sample that trojanized Psiphon, a popular VPN app that has over 50
million downloads. 

Given the likelihood of physical installation as the initial vector for BouldSpy, it’s possible that
BouldSpy victims had legitimate versions of these apps installed when their devices were
confiscated, and that those apps were trojanized in order to avoid detection by the victim.

Technical analysis

Persistent background activities

4/9



Most of BouldSpy’s surveillance actions happen in the background by abusing Android
accessibility services. It also relies heavily on establishing a CPU wake lock and disabled
battery management features to prevent the device from shutting down the spyware’s
activities. As a result, victims could expect their device battery to drain much faster than
normal. Once installed, the spyware will seek to establish a network connection to its C2
server and exfiltrate any cached data from the victim’s device to the server.

 
These actions occur when the user opens the app, or when the device is booted or rebooted.
To make sure it can take actions frequently and consistently, BouldSpy uses a background
service to handle most of the surveillance functionality. As illustrated in the below figure, the
service restarts itself when its parent activity is stopped by either the user or the Android
system.

When the activity is stopped with an “onDestroy()” call, a new Intent is created which restarts
“MainService.” MainService handles most of BouldSpy’s surveillance functionality.

Insecure C2 communication
We found that BouldSpy has the ability to encrypt files for exfiltration, but uses unencrypted
web traffic between victim devices and the C2. This insecure implementation by the threat
actor makes network analysis and detection easier by exposing the whole C2 communication
in clear text.

This is a screenshot of plaintext C2 traffic we observed. It’s a POST request to C2 server
192.99.251[.]51 containing plaintext commands and associated job IDs, status, exfil (in the
“data[]” field), whether the job was successful, and the app module (such as “Messages” or
“LocationManager”) executing the data collection.

Ability to run additional code
BouldSpy also has the ability to run arbitrary code, and download and run additional custom
code from the C2, or run code within other apps as needed. This gives the malware
additional options, such as the ability to improve its collection capabilities, introduce
functionalities, or set up persistence in other apps.

SMS commands
Aside from the normal C2 via a web server, BouldSpy can also receive commands via SMS
from a control phone, which is a fairly unique feature. This enables the spyware to surveil
victims even in poorly-developed regions that lack internet availability, but are still reachable
over standard cell networks.

SMS commands follow a format starting with asterisk (*) and ending with the hashtag/pound
sign (#) with arbitrary text between them. The commands usually start with a three-digit
number and are split into separate parameters which are separated by asterisks. The known
commands are listed in the table below.

Command Function Parameters

760 Takes Uses four parameters. These are the number of shots to take,
photos the duration (unused), the wait time between shots, and
from device whether to use the front or back camera. For example, the
cameras command *760*3*6*30*1# would take three photos from the

front camera and wait 30 seconds between shots.

770 Records Uses three parameters which are the number, duration, and
from the wait time between recordings. For example, *770*2*30*40#
microphone takes two 30-second recordings with a 40-second delay

between recordings.

780 Gets the Uses no parameters, but has unused placeholders. A known
device example is *780*1*1#.
location

790 Enables or Uses just one parameter to enable or disable the device Wi-Fi.
disables An example is *790*2# which enables Wi-Fi. *790*1# disables
Wi-Fi Wi-Fi.

140 Change C2 This uses one long parameter consisting of seven parts. An
address example command setting the new C2 to 192.99.251[.]51:3000

looks like this: *140*119209925105130001#

BouldSpy samples ship with ransomware code borrowed from an open source Android
ransomware project named CryDroid. However, Lookout researchers assess this code as
unused and nonfunctional. This code might be a sign of an ongoing development or a false
flag artifact to misdirect analysts.

Command and Control Infrastructure
Lookout found BouldSpy C2 servers at IP addresses 192.99.251[.]51, 192.99.251[.]50,
192.99.251[.]49, 192.99.251[.]54, 84.234.96[.]117, and 149.56.92[.]127. Of these, only
192.99.251[.]51 and 84.234.96[.]117 are currently active. A common feature of these is the
use of port 3000 to access the C2’s administration panel, which requires authentication.
From analyzing these servers, we were able to uncover the following victim information:

66,000 call logs
15,000 installed apps
100,000 contacts
3,700 user accounts

7/9



3,000 downloaded files
9,000 keylogs
900 locations
400,000 text messages
2,500 photos

 
We believe that there are likely more victims and associated data collected because
exfiltration data on C2 servers are often cleared.
