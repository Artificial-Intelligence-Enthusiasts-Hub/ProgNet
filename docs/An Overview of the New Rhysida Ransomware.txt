current Rhysida ransomware samples’ encryption routine.

workbench alerts for Rhysida and its components.

Introduction
On August 4, 2023, the HHS’ Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3)
released a security alert about a relatively new ransomware called Rhysida (detected as
Ransom.PS1.RHYSIDA.SM), which has been active since May 2023. In this blog entry, we
will provide details on Rhysida, including its targets and what we know about its infection
chain.

Who is behind the Rhysida ransomware?
Not much is currently known about the threat actors behind Rhysida in terms of origin or
affiliations. According to the HC3 alert, Rhysida poses itself as a “cybersecurity team” that
offers to assist victims in finding security weaknesses within their networks and system. In
fact, the group’s first appearance involved the use of a victim chat support portal.

Who are Rhysida’s targets?
As mentioned earlier, Rhysida, which was previously known for targeting the education,
government, manufacturing, and tech industries, among others — has begun conducting
attacks on healthcare and public health organizations. The healthcare industry has seen an

1/13



increasing number of ransomware attacks over the past five years.  This includes a recent
incident involving Prospect Medical Holdings, a California-based healthcare system, that
occurred in early August (although the group behind the attack has yet to be named as of
writing).

Data from Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN) shows a similar trend, where
detections from May to August 2023 show that its operators are targeting multiple industries
rather than focusing on just a single sector.

The threat actor also targets organizations around the world, with SPN data showing several
countries where Rhysida binaries were detected, including Indonesia, Germany, and the
United States.

Figure 2. The Rhysida ransomware infection chain
Rhysida ransomware usually arrives on a victim’s machine via phishing lures, after which
Cobalt Strike is used for lateral movement within the system.

Additionally, our telemetry shows that the threat actors execute PsExec to deploy PowerShell
scripts and the Rhysida ransomware payload itself. The PowerShell script (g.ps1), detected
as Trojan.PS1.SILENTKILL.A, is used by the threat actors to terminate antivirus-related
processes and services, delete shadow copies, modify remote desktop protocol (RDP)
configurations, and change the active directory (AD) password.

Interestingly, it appears that the script (g.ps1) was updated by the threat actors during
execution, eventually leading us to a PowerShell version of the Rhysida ransomware.

Rhysida ransomware employs a 4096-bit RSA key and AES-CTR for file encryption, which
we discuss in detail in a succeeding section. After successful encryption, it appends the
.rhysida extension and drops the ransom note CriticalBreachDetected.pdf.

This ransom note is fairly unusual — instead of an outright ransom demand as seen in most
ransom notes from other ransomware families, the Rhysida ransom note is presented as an
alert from the Rhysida “cybersecurity team” notifying victims that their system has been

4/13



compromised and their files encrypted. The ransom demand comes in the form of a “unique
key” designed to restore encrypted files, which must be paid for by the victim.

Impact Rhysida ransomware Ransomware encryption

Table 1. A summary of the malware, tools, and exploits used by Rhysida
A closer look at Rhysida’s encryption routine 
After analyzing current Rhysida samples, we  observed that the ransomware uses
LibTomCrypt, an open-source cryptographic library, to implement its encryption routine.
Figure 3 shows the procedures Rhysida follows when initializing its encryption parameters. 

 

Figure 3. Rhysida’s parameters for encryption
Rhysida uses LibTomCrypt’s pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) functionalities for
key and initialization vector (IV) generation. The init_prng function is used to initialize PRNG
functionalities as shown in Figure 4. The same screenshot also shows how the ransomware

5/13



uses the library’s ChaCha20 PRNG functionality.

Figure 4. Rhysida’s use of the “init_prng” function
After the PRNG is initialized, Rhysida then proceeds to import the embedded RSA key and
declares the encryption algorithm it will use for file encryption:

It will use the register_cipher function to “register” the algorithm (in this case, aes), to
its table of usable ciphers.
It will use the find_cipher function to store the algorithm to be used (still aes), in the
variable CIPHER.

Afterward, it will proceed to also register and declare aes for its Cipher Hash Construction
(CHC) functionalities. 

Based on our analysis, Rhysida’s encryption routine follows these steps:

1. After it reads file contents for encryption, it will use the initialized PRNG’s function,
chacha20_prng_read, to generate both a key and an IV that are unique for each file.

2. It will use the ctr_start function to initialize the cipher that will be used, which is aes
(from the variable CIPHER), in counter or CTR mode.

3. The generated key and IV are then encrypted with the rsa_encrypt_key_ex function.
4. Once the key and IV are encrypted, Rhysida will proceed to encrypt the file using

LibTomCrypt’s ctr_encrypt function.

Figure 5. Rhysida’s encryption routine
Unfortunately, since each encrypted file has a unique key and IV — and only the attackers
have a copy of the associated private key — decryption is currently not feasible.

How can organizations protect themselves from Rhysida and other
ransomware families?
Although we are still in the process of fully analyzing Rhysida ransomware and its tools,
tactics, and procedures (TTPs), the best practices for defending against ransomware attacks
still holds true for Rhysida and other ransomware families.

Here are several recommended measures that organizations implement to safeguard their
systems from ransomware attacks:

Create an inventory of assets and data
Review event and incident logs
Manage hardware and software configurations.
Grant administrative privileges and access only when relevant to an employee's role
and responsibilities.
Enforce security configurations on network infrastructure devices like firewalls and
routers.
Establish a software whitelist permitting only legitimate applications
Perform routine vulnerability assessments
Apply patches or virtual patches for operating systems and applications
Keep software and applications up to date using their latest versions
Integrate data protection, backup, and recovery protocols
Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) mechanisms
Utilize sandbox analysis to intercept malicious emails
Regularly educate and evaluate employees' security aptitude

Deploy security tools (such as XDR) which are capable of detecting abuse of legitimate
applications
