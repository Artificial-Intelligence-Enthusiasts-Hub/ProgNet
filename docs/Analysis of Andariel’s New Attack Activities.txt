5. Conclusion  

The Andariel threat group which usually targets Korean corporations and organizations is
known to be affiliated with the Lazarus threat group or one of its subsidiaries. Attacks against
Korean targets have been identified since 2008. Major target industries are those related to

1/24



national security such as national defense, political organizations, shipbuilding, energy, and
communications. Various other companies and institutes in Korea including universities,
logistics, and ICT companies are also becoming attack targets. [1] (this report only supports
the Korean version)

During the initial compromise stage, the Andariel threat group usually employs spear
phishing, watering hole, and supply chain attacks. Additionally, there are cases where the
group abuses central management solutions during the malware installation process. [2] A
notable fact about the group is its creation and use of various malware types in its attacks.
There are many backdoor types, including Andarat, Andaratm, Phandoor, and Rifdoor used
in the past attacks, as well as TigerRAT [3] and MagicRAT [4] which have been detected for
the past few years.

AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) is continuously monitoring the attacks
of the Andariel threat group. This blog post will cover details surrounding the recently
identified attacks deemed to be perpetrated by the Andariel group. Note that because the
malware strains and C&C servers identified in past attack cases were not used in the
aforementioned attacks, there is no direct connection. Thus, in order to identify the
connection between the recent attacks and the Andariel threat group, this post will first
analyze the cases of attacks by the Andariel group in the first half of 2023. Then the analysis
will be used to identify the possible link between the attacks and the threat group. Details
confirmed in the past attack cases will be included if necessary.

One characteristic of the attacks identified in 2023 is that there are numerous malware
strains developed in the Go language. In an attack case where Innorix Agent was used, a
Reverse Shell developed in Go was used. Black RAT was used in attacks targeting Korean
companies afterward. Such trends continued into the recent cases, where other malware
strains developed in Go such as Goat RAT and DurianBeacon are being used in attacks.
Besides the Go version, DurianBeacon has a version developed in the Rust language as
well.

Figure 1. Source code information of DurianBeacon developed in Go
Because the initial distribution case could not be identified directly, this post will conduct an
analysis based on the malware strains used in the attacks. Note that various malware types
are being used in the attacks. When a name given by the malware creator can be confirmed,
the said name will be used. If not, the names of similar malware types or AhnLab’s detection
name will be used.

1. Past attack cases

2/24



1.1. Cases of Innorix Agent abuse

In February 2023, ASEC shared the case where the Andariel threat group distributed
malware to users with a vulnerable version of Innorix Agent in the blog post “Distribution of
Malware Exploiting Vulnerable Innorix: Andariel.” [5] The Innorix Agent program abused in
distribution is a file transfer solution client program. According to the post regarding the
vulnerability by the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), the affected versions were
found to be INNORIX Agent 9.2.18.450 or earlier, which were advised to be applied with the
security update. [6] (this content only supports the Korean version)

Figure 2. Malware being distributed using Innorix Agent which had been vulnerable in the
past
An investigation of the malware strains used in the attacks based on past attack cases
revealed that multiple Korean universities were infected with malware strains. Most malware
types used in the attacks were backdoors, and no previously identified type was present.
However, because there is a connection with other malware strains used in the past or those
used in subsequent attacks, a brief summary of their characteristics will be given.

1.1.1. NukeSped variant – Volgmer

As covered in the ASEC Blog before, this malware strain uses the following 0x10 byte key in
the process of communicating with the C&C server to encrypt packets. The key value in
question is the same as the one employed in Volgmer used by the Hidden Cobra (Lazarus)
threat group, as stated in a report by the United States Cybersecurity & Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA). [7] (page currently unavailable)

Key: 74 61 51 04 77 32 54 45 89 95 12 52 12 02 32 73

Volgmer was also used in comparatively recent attacks. It runs by reading the configuration
data saved in the registry key “HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Security” and
uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with the C&C server. Such characteristics are highly
similar to the type mentioned in the CISA report in the past, which means that the malware

3/24



continues to be used in attacks with no significant variants being released. While the same
key value was used in both the malware mentioned in this post and Volgmer, there is a
difference: the malware used in the current attack cases uses the key value to encrypt the
packets used to communicate with the C&C server. Meanwhile, Volgmer uses the value to
decrypt the encrypted configuration data saved in the registry.

Accordingly, it is not entirely accurate to categorize the above malware strain as a type of
Volgmer, so it was categorized as a variant of NukeSped instead. The malware is a
comparatively simple backdoor that only provides basic features. Notably, the Batch script
used in the self-deletion process is similar to the one used in NukeSped types in the past.

Figure 3. Batch script used in the self-deletion process
1.1.2. Andardoor

Developed in .NET, this malware is a backdoor that uses the name TestProgram. Based on
AhnLab’s detection name, it is classified as Andardoor. It is notable for being obfuscated
using the Dotfuscator tool. It offers various features for controlling the infected system, such
as file and process tasks, executing commands, and capturing screenshots. SSL encryption
is used for communication with the C&C server. For the server name, it designated the
“clientName” string.

Figure 4. SSL communications routine with the C&C server
1.1.3. 1th Troy Reverse Shell

4/24



1th Troy is a Reverse Shell malware developed in Go. The following string included in the
binary shows that the malware has the simple name of “Reverse_Base64_Pipe” and the
malware’s creator classified the malware as “1th Troy”.

G:/Code/01__1th Troy/Go/Reverse_Base64_Pipe/Client/client.go

Being a Reverse Shell that only provides basic commands, the commands supported include
“cmd”, “exit”, and “self delete”. They support the command execution, process termination,
and self-deletion features respectively.

Figure 5. Reverse Shell with a simple structure
1.2. Cases of attacks against Korean corporations

The Andariel group also distributed malware in March 2023 in its attacks against the Korean
defense industry and an electronics device manufacturer. The method of initial compromise
has not yet been identified, but logs of the mshta.exe process installing TigerRat and the
mshta.exe process being terminated were confirmed through the AhnLab Smart Defense
(ASD) infrastructure. This means that the malware strains were installed through a script-
type malware with the spear phishing attack method.

Figure 6. Mshta process

installing TigerRat
Malware strains used in attacks were generally backdoor types. TigerRat, which has been
used by the Andariel group since the past, was also included.

1.2.1. TigerRat

TigerRat is a RAT-type malware with its name given by KISA [8] and has been consistently
employed by the Andariel threat group since 2020. It is known to be generally distributed
through malicious document files containing macros that are attached to spear phishing

5/24



emails, or through watering hole attacks. [9] There are also cases where the Andariel group
targeted Korean corporations that use vulnerable versions of VMware Horizon and launched
Log4Shell vulnerability attacks to install TigerRat. [10]

Besides offering basic features such as file tasks and executing commands, TigerRat is a
backdoor that supports other various features such as collecting information, keylogging,
capturing screenshots, and port forwarding. One of its characteristics is that there is an
authentication process upon the first communication session with the C&C server. In past
versions, the string shown below disguised as SSL communications was used in the
authentication process. Depending on the malware version, either the string “HTTP 1.1
/member.php SSL3.4” or “HTTP 1.1 /index.php?member=sbi2009 SSL3.3.7” must be sent to
the C&C server, and the string “HTTP 1.1 200 OK SSL2.1” should be sent in return for
authentication to be successful.

Figure 7. String used in the authentication process for the C&C server – past version
However, in the recently identified NukeSped type, the following random strings 0x20 in size
are used. These strings are thought to be the MD5 hash for “fool”
(dd7b696b96434d2bf07b34f9c125d51d) and “iwan” (01ccce480c60fcdb67b54f4509ffdb56).
It seems that the threat actor used random strings in the authentication process to evade
network detection.

Figure 8. String used in authentication to the C&C server – latest version
C&C request string: dd7b696b96434d2bf07b34f9c125d51d
C&C response string: 01ccce480c60fcdb67b54f4509ffdb56

 
1.2.2. Black RAT

Black Rat is a backdoor-type malware that is likely created by the threat actor. Like other
malware strains, it was developed in Go. While the 1th Troy Reverse Shell identified in the
previous case only supports a basic command execution feature, Black Rat provides many
additional features such as downloading files and capturing screenshots.

6/24



Figure 9. Features supported by Black RAT

Examining the following string included in the binary shows that the malware creator
classified the malware as a RAT type and named it Black.

I:/01___Tools/02__RAT/Black/Client_Go/Client.go

 
1.2.3. NukeSped variants

A typical NukeSped-type backdoor was also used in this attack. Supported features include
network scanning, process and file lookup, file upload/download, and command execution.
The names of the APIs to be used are encrypted as shown below. These are decrypted and
the API names are taken from somewhere else. A key with a size of 0x26 is used for
decryption.

7/24



Figure 10.

Obfuscated API string
Key value used for decryption: i<6fu>-0|HSLRCqd.xHqMB]4H#axZ%5!5!?SQ&

This NukeSped variant also uses a Batch script for self-deletion, but it is slightly different
from the one used in the previous attacks.

Figure 11. Batch script used in the self-deletion process
There are two types of identified NukeSped variants: Reverse Shell and Bind Shell types.
Both listen to port number 10443. This NukeSped variant has an authentication process
before communicating with the C&C server like TigerRat. Yet whereas TigerRat disguised the
process as SSL communications, NukeSped disguised it as HTTP communications. Thus,
after sending the following POST request, an accurately matching HTTP response must be
received for the malware to commence communications with the C&C server.

8/24

2. Cases of Recent Attacks

ASEC is monitoring attacks of the Andariel group and has recently identified cases of Innorix
Agent being abused to install malware. Unlike past cases where Innorix Agent was
downloading malware strains, the recent case directly creates the malware file, so it is not
certain whether the attacks are vulnerability attacks or if Innorix Agent was simply abused.

Malware strains identified in these attacks are not those that had been used by the Andariel
group in the past, but aside from the fact that Innorix was used in the attacks, the current
attack is similar to past attack cases in that the attack targets are Korean universities. While
the attack was being perpetrated, attack cases against Korean ICT companies, electronic

9/24



device manufacturers, the shipbuilding industry, and the manufacturing industry were
identified as well. Analysis showed that there was a connection with the malware strains
used in attack cases where Innorix was abused.

This part will analyze each attack case and malware strains used in the attacks. Afterward, a
summary will be given of the conclusion that the same threat actor is behind these attacks
and the basis behind the claim, as well as the relationship between the current attacks and
past attack cases of the Andariel threat group.

 
2.1. Cases of Innorix Agent abuse

2.1.1. Goat RAT

In recent attacks against Korean universities, there were cases where Innorix Agent installed
malware strains. Innorix Agent installed the malware strains under the name “iexplorer.exe”.
This is one of the names that has been often used by the Andariel group.

Figure 13. Using Innorix Agent to install Goat RAT

E:/Projects/Malware/6_Goat_23/Goat/anti-vacci ne.go
E:/Projects/Malware/6_Goat_23/Goat/command.go  

Although the recent version is obfuscated unlike the Go-based backdoor-type malware used
in past attacks, basic file tasks, self-deletion features, etc. can be identified. There are also
logs where the following commands were executed.

> cmd /c tasklist
> cmd /c ipconfig  /all

10/24



Figure 14. Obfuscated function name
2.2. Cases of attacks against Korean corporations

2.2.1. AndarLoader

Aside from the attack cases where Innorix Agent was abused, ASEC identified another type
of attack in a similar period of time. While the initial distribution route has not yet been
ascertained, the malware strains used in the attacks were obfuscated with a tool called
Dotfuscator like the .NET malware strains classified as Andardoor. Another common trait is
that both types use SSL communications with the C&C server. Unlike Andardoor which used
“clientName” when connecting to the C&C server, this attack case used the string “sslClient”.

Figure 15. SSL connection process with the C&C server
Whereas Andardoor had most of its features already implemented, this malware strain only
has a downloader feature to download and execute executable data such as .NET
assemblies from external sources. Out of the commands sent from the C&C server, the
commands shown below can be used to execute or terminate the received code. Behaviors
performed by the threat actor using AndarLoader include installing Mimikatz in the infected
system, which has been confirmed through a recorded log.

11/24



At the time of analysis, the C&C server was unavailable for access and the part in charge of
the actual features could not be investigated, so no direct similarity with Andardoor could be
confirmed. However, the use of the same obfuscation tool or the similarities in the
communication process with the C&C server led AhnLab to categorize this malware as the
AndarLoader type.

Command Feature
alibaba Execute the downloaded .NET assemblies

facebook Execute the downloaded .NET method

exit Terminate

vanish Self-delete and terminate

Table 1. List of commands that can be executed
Among the commands given by the treat actor that AndarLoader executes, there is a
command to terminate the mshta.exe process. The fact that AndarLoader was installed via
PowerShell and the mshta.exe process was involved leaves the possibility that this is a
spear phishing attack like the cases of attacks covered above.

Figure 16. Commands executed by AndarLoader
Additionally, logs of the mshta.exe process connecting to the C&C server can be found in
systems infected with AndarLoader.

12/24



Figure 17. Network communications log
The domain kro.kr was used as the C&C and download URLs. This is a domain generally
used by the Kimsuky threat group. Also, the fact that Ngrok was installed for RDP connection
during the attack process shows how the case is similar to the attack pattern of the Kimsuky
group.

Figure 18. Log

showing the installed Ngrok being executed
2.2.2. DurianBeacon

13/24



While investigating the AndarLoader malware, AhnLab identified that a malware strain
named DurianBeacon was also used in the attack process. There are two versions of
DurianBeacon, one developed in Go and the other developed in Rust. Both are backdoors
that can perform malicious behaviors by receiving the threat actor’s commands from the
C&C server.

A. Go Version

Examining the following strings included in the binary indicates that the malware creator
named this malware strain DurianBeacon.

G:/Dev/Go/DurianBeacon/Command.go
G:/Dev/Go/DurianBeacon/SSL.go  
G:/Dev/Go/DurianBeacon/Utils.go
G:/Dev/Go/DurianBeacon/main.go 

The Go version of DurianBeacon uses the SSL protocol to communicate with the C&C
server. After initial access, it sends the infected system’s IP information, user name, desktop
name, architecture, and file names before awaiting commands. When a command is sent, it
returns a result. Supported features besides collecting basic information about the infected
system include file download/upload, lookup, and command execution features.

Figure 19. Features supported by

DurianBeacon

14/24



Because the SSL protocol is used, communications packets are encrypted. The following
packet structure is used internally.

Offset Size Description
0x00 0x04 Command number

0x04 0x04 Size of the command argument

0x08 Variable Command argument

Table 2. Command packet structure of DurianBeacon
The features corresponding to each command code are as follows.

Command Feature
0x00 Hibernate

0x01 Interval

0x02 Execute commands (return results)

0x03 Look up directories

0x04 Drive information

0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08 Upload files

0x09, 0x0A, 0x0B Download files

0x0C Create directories

0x0D Delete files

0x0E Run commands

0x0F Terminate

Table 3. List of DurianBeacon commands
After executing commands, the malware sends the success status or the command
execution results to the threat actor’s C&C server. The response is also similar to the
command packet.

0x00 0x04 Response number

0x04 0x04 Size of the command execution results

0x08, 0x09, 0x0A Download files (error, success, etc.)

0x0B, 0x0C Create directories (failure or success)

0x0D, 0x0E Delete files (failure or success)

0x0F, 0x10 Run commands (failure or success)

Table 5. DurianBeacon’s response list
B. Rust Version

Investigation of related files revealed that the Rust version of DurianBeacon was also used in
attacks.

PDB information: C:\Users\Anna\Documents\DurianBeacon\target\x86_64-pc-windows-
msvc\release\deps\DurianBeacon.pdb

DurianBeacon supports packet encryption using XOR aside from SSL to communicate with
the C&C server, using the key 0x57.

16/24



Figure 20. Rust version of DurianBeacon supporting XOR encryption
The packet structure and commands are also the same as the Go version. The Rust version
of DurianBeacon sends the keyword “durian2023” alongside the infected system’s IP
information, user name, desktop name, architecture, and file names before awaiting
command. When a command is sent, it returns the results.

Figure 21. Communications packet of the Rust version – test
3. Connections to recent attack cases

The above section covered the recently identified two cases where universities in Korea
were attacked through abusing Innorix Agent and where malware strains were installed in
Korean corporations through presumably spear phishing attacks. This part will explain why
AhnLab considers the same threat actor to be behind both types of attacks.

First, there are cases in AhnLab’s ASD logs where Durian, Goat RAT, and AndarLoader were
collected together in a similar period. The system in question is thought to be the threat
actor’s test PC because the path name of AndarLoader was as follows.

17/24



AndarLoader collection path: d:\01__developing\99__c#_obfuscated\runtime
broker.exe

There are also cases where the C&C servers of backdoor-type malware strains were the
same. When the threat actor used Innorix Agent to install malware, Goat RAT was mainly
employed, but there is a significant portion where other malware strains were installed. While
such malware samples could not be collected, there are recorded communications logs with
the C&C server. Also, the URL in question was the same as the DurianBeacon C&C server
URL used in other attacks.

Figure 22. C&C communications log of the malware installed through Innorix Agent
Finally, there was a log where DurianBeacon installed AndarLoader. This means that these
attacks happened around a similar time period, and the attacks might be related to each
other as the installation processes and the C&C server URLs used tend to be similar.

Figure 23. Log showing DurianBeacon creating AndarLoader
4. Connections to past attack cases of the Andariel group

The recently identified two attack cases are likely done by the same threat actor. This section
will cover the relationship between these attacks and the Andariel threat group.

A. Attack Targets

18/24



Attacked universities, the national defense industry, electronic device manufacturers,
ICT companies, etc. in Korea.

B. Attack Methods

Abused Innorix Agent like in past cases
Probably employed spear phishing method like in past cases
Similarities between the path and file names used when installing the malware strains

C. Malware Types Used

Malware strains developed in Go were used
Similarities between Andardoor and AndarLoader
Malware types similar to the Infostealer used in previous attacks were identified

First, there are the facts that the industries and sectors that became attack targets were the
same as the targets identified in past attack cases and the same attack methods used in
previous attacks were employed in recent cases. AhnLab identified cases where Innorix
Agent was used. While not confirmed, many logs showed circumstances of spear phishing
attacks.

The file name “iexplorer.exe” used to install malware has been identified from Andariel’s past
attack cases to the present. Besides “iexplorer.exe”, names including the “svc” keyword such
as “authsvc.exe” and “creditsvc.exe” has been continuously used. Also, aside from
“mainsvc.exe” and “certsvc.exe”, there are cases where similar names such as “netsvc.exe”
and “srvcredit.exe” were used.

As covered in the corresponding section, AndarLoader was obfuscated with the trial version
of Dotfuscator, the tool used in Andardoor in previous attacks. It also uses SSL encryption to
communicate with the C&C server, again showing similarities with past attack cases. Two
other malware strains developed in Go were used as well. These align with the trend of
malware strains developed in Go such as 1th Troy Reverse Shell and Black RAT
continuously being used since the early part of this year.

Finally, there is also the system thought to be the threat actor’s test PC and Infostealer
strains presumably created by the threat actor during the attack process. In fact, the Andariel
group in the past installed malware strains responsible for stealing account credentials
during the attack process, exfiltrating account credentials saved in Internet Explorer,
Chrome, and Firefox web browsers. Such malware strains are command line tools that
output the extracted account credentials via command lines. It seems that the threat actor
used a backdoor to send the results to the C&C server.

19/24



Figure 24. Infostealer identified in past attack cases
The Infostealer used in the recent attacks has a similar format. The only difference is that it
only targets web browsers and steals account credentials and histories. Additionally, unlike
the past cases where results were outputted by command lines, the recent version saves the
stolen information in the same path under the file name “error.log”.

20/24



Figure 25. Infostealer identified in recent attack cases
5. Conclusion

The Andariel group is one of the highly active threat groups targeting Korea along with
Kimsuky and Lazarus. The group launched attacks to gain information related to national
security in the early days but now carries out attacks for financial gains. [11] The group is
known to employ spear phishing attacks, watering hole attacks, and vulnerability exploits for
their initial infiltration process. There have also been cases where it used other vulnerabilities
in the attack process to distribute malware strains.

Users must be particularly cautious about attachments to emails with unknown sources or
executable files downloaded from websites. Users should also apply the latest patch for OS
and programs such as internet browsers and update V3 to the latest version to prevent
malware infection in advance.
