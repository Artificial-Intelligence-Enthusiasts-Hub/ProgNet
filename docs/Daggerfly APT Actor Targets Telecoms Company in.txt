MgBot modular malware framework

MgBot is a well-designed modular framework that is actively maintained. The components of
the framework are the following:

MgBot EXE dropper
MgBot DLL Loader
MgBot Plugins

The MgBot plugins that were deployed in this activity have numerous capabilities that can
provide the attackers with a significant amount of information about compromised machines.
Among the unique plugins that were deployed during this activity were:

Network scanner – innocence.dll
Capabilities include: arp scan, http scan, determining the type of server (e.g.
SQL, WebLogic, Redis, etc.) it is running on.

A Chrome and Firefox infostealer that can gather information such as bookmarks and
browsing history – bkmk.dll
Logging module – famdowm.dll

Based on the open-source easylogging++, which can carry out basic logging,
track performance and more.

QQ messages infostealer – qmsdp.dll
Based on this blog, which details how a chat tool message database was cracked
by hackers.

1/6



Active Directory enumeration – ceeeb.dll
Collects the following information from Active directory:

Members info
Computers 
Local Admins
Remote Desktop Users
Dcom Users

Password dumper – cpfwplgx.dll
Drops a file to call the MiniDumpWriteDump API to dump a process memory.

QQ Keylogger – kstrcs.dll
Keylogger that targets QQEdit.exe and QQ.exe processes.

Screen and clipboard grabber – cbmrpa.dll
Captures clipboard and drag and drop data and saves it to a file.

Outlook and Foxmail credentials stealer – maillfpassword.dll
Audio capture – prsm.dll

Captures audio from the infected system.
Uses COM objects IMMDeviceEnumerator, IAudioCaptureClient.

Process Watchdog – ansecprocesskeep.dll
Registered as service AnsecProcessKeep.
Confirmed to be a watchdog that keeps a process running.
The process name is found in an .ini file.

All of these capabilities would have allowed the attackers to collect a significant amount of
information from victim machines. The capabilities of these plugins also show that the main
goal of the attackers during this campaign was information-gathering.

Daggerfly’s development of these previously unseen plugins demonstrates that the attack
group is continuing to actively develop its malware and the tools it can use to target victim
networks.  

Continuation of a Trend
Telecoms companies will always be a key target in intelligence gathering campaigns due to
the access they can potentially provide to the communications of end-users.

Symantec’s Threat Hunter team also spotted some other recent activity targeting telecoms
companies that was linked with moderate confidence to the threat actor Othorene (aka
Gallium), in what appeared to be a continuation of an intelligence-gathering campaign first
reported on by SentinelOne under the name Operation Tainted Love in March. SentinelOne
reported that in that campaign Othorene was targeting telecoms companies in the Middle
East.

2/6



Othorene has been active since around 2014, and it is believed to be a relatively small group
that has a strong focus on the surveillance of individuals. There are some indications that
Othorene may have links with the APT41 (aka Blackfly, Grayfly) APT group also. Overlap of
both personnel and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) among Chinese APT groups
is not uncommon, and can mean that attributing activity to one group with high confidence is
difficult.

In the activity Symantec saw, we found three additional victims of the same campaign that
SentinelOne detailed, located in Asia and Africa. Two of the three were subsidiaries of the
same Middle Eastern telecoms firm. The attackers had been active on victim networks since
November 2022. Symantec saw attackers dumping credentials and scanning the network
using NbtScan.

The main malware (pc.exe dubbed mim221) in this campaign was used to dump credentials,
and it had the same password as the malware used in the activity documented by
SentinelOne. The attackers also moved laterally across victims’ networks, used Scheduled
Task for persistence, and dumped SAM and System hives from the registry. There were
indications that the attackers may have exported the Active Directory database on victim
machines, and they were also able to gain access to domain controllers, giving them deep
access to victim networks.

Indicators of Compromise
If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect
and block that file.
