The APT28 intrusion set (aka. Sofacy, PawnStorm, Fancy Bear), associated to the Russian
GRU and famous for its cyber espionage and sabotage campaigns, was observed using
multiple phishing techniques to target the Ukrainian civil society. These techniques include
using HTTP webhook services such as as Pipedream and Webhook, as well as

1/10



compromised Ubiquiti routers to steal victims’ credentials. On one occasion, APT28 was
seen using the “Browser in the Browser” technique to display a fake login page to the victim,
purporting to decrypt a document.

The majority of retrieved phishing webpages target the UKR.NET webmail service, which is
popular among Ukrainian society. However, APT28 could use the same techniques against
other webmail services used by western civil society which supports Ukraine.

This small blogpost aims at presenting the different techniques used by APT28 to create
their spear phishing webpages, as well as ways to detect them, including IOCs and YARA
rules.

Technique 1: Man in the browser
During their investigations, Sekoia.io TDR analysts identified a file named CDS Daily Brief
23.03.2023.html, impersonating the Ukrainian security think tank Centre for Defence
Strategies. The centre provides online daily briefings on the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. The
retrieved decoy document trick the victim into click on a button to decrypt the page content,
which is presumably secured by a UKR.NET technology.

Clicking on the button displays fake login window. This window contains an iframe that
embeds a fake UKR.NET login webpage hosted on robot-876.frge[.]io – which was
deactivated during the investigation and was already published by Google TAG. The
intention here is to trick the user into entering their credentials.

This is the only known phishing case from APT28 that we know of where the intrusion set
uses an HTML attachment with the Man in the Browser technique to trick the user into
entering its credentials. Although the code and the technique was copied from the mrd0x
original blogpost dating back to 2022, the analysed document is currently only detected by
one antivirus engine on VirusTotal (eScan) at the time of writing.

Technique 2: Use of HTTP debugging / webhook services by APT28
A second technique that we observed used by APT28 since more than a year is the use of
public HTTP debugging / webhook services in their phishing webpages to retrieve stolen
credentials, as shown below:

Therefore, APT28 operators don’t need to setup any extra script or infrastructure to collect
the credentials, but only to setup a webhook page on the service and wait to receive
credentials from the victim. During the investigation, we identified two services abused by
APT28, PipeDream.com and Webhook.site, both receiving HTTP requests without any user
inscription.

This technique was at least on two phishing webpages operated by APT28, the first one
targeting UKR.NET, and the second one targeting Yahoo.com, as shown below:

This is the first time we see a state-sponsored threat actor use these services for phishing
operations. While this technique remains effective, from a security perspective, there is a
concern that some services might allow access to hooks created by simply by
specifying the hook identifier. This implies that anyone accessing the phishing page can
view stolen credentials by looking at the specific hook.

Technique 3: Use of compromised Ubiquiti Routers by APT28.
The aforementioned technique is only applicable to accounts with 1FA authentication, as the
webhook service lacks the capability to interact with the UKR.NET servers for validating the
second factor and retrieving authentication cookies or tokens. For 2FA accounts, APT28
created dedicated webpages hosted on *.frge[.]io domains that interact with a Python script
running on compromised Ubiquiti routers.

Here is an extract from the HTML code of a phishing webpage that points to a compromised
Ubiquiti router ( 174.53.242.108):

The Python script, which was leaked on Twitter, interacts with the UKR.NET API to
authenticate the user and bypass 2FA. Interestingly, as the UKR.NET service uses
RecaptchaV2 during the authentication process, the Python script contains code to bypass
the captcha by using the anti-captcha.com service API with the customer key equal to
acbb64c3de5ea5e5936df4a1eecf1235.

The script enables two other interesting features. The first one is that it activates IMAP
access via the UKR.NET API for the compromised mail account and saves the generated
password from UKR.NET, which will be used for this access, to a file as shown below.
Embedding IMAP access to the mailbox is a known trick that allows APT28 operators to
automate mail exfiltration.

Another interesting feature embedded in this script is that it deletes the last emails received
from noreply@ukr.net. Sekoia.io analysts assess this is almost certainly done to cover up
changes to the mailbox security settings. It is also highly likely a technique to prevent the
user from being alerted to a new access to the mailbox.

Through the use of heuristics, Sekoia.io discovered five different Ubiquiti routers hosting the
Python script. All of them were already compromised by the same SSH rootkit, as
indicated by their unusual SSH banners. This rootkit is based on the openssh-backdoor-kit
open-source project. This rootkit has already compromised hundreds of Ubiquiti
routers, as evidenced by the returned SSH banners. It is unclear whether this rootkit is

6/10



used by APT28 or another threat actor who is also looking for shells on embedded devices.
So far, no other compromised SOHO brands or VPS instances were matching our heuristics
on the APT28’s 2FA phishing script.

Update: An attentive reader said that it is likely that APT28 took over the routers by exploiting
the SSH backdoor, as the backdoor has been already analyzed and its passwords published.
Moreover, one of the backdoored sshd sample was known on VT since 2018.

As demonstrated in our FLINT report on CVE-2023-23397, APT-28 recently used
compromised Ubiquiti Edge devices, based on EdgeOS, as operational boxes to serve
Responder instances on 445. Attackers seem to find EdgeOs, which is based on the
Debian fork Vyatta, particularly interesting due to its default password, WAN access, and
Aptitude package management capabilities. These features make it easy for them to deploy
their scripts.

Links to APT28
Sekoia.io analysts link their campaigns to APT28 with high confidence based on two
artefacts.

APT28 uses the getforge service since 2022, which produces the frge[.]io domain names. In
2022, APT28 used this service to exploit the Follina vulnerability and drop its CredoMap
stealer. This service allows for free hosting of static web pages and is no longer maintained
by the company that created it. Sekoia.io analysts think that APT28 may see this as a good
opportunity to host web pages without the risk of being taken down.

The final point pertains to the use of HTTP webhooks and mocking-free services in APT28’s
operations. They appear to use these services to host payloads and retrieve victim data
because getforge doesn’t allow to host dynamic webpages. Moreover, these services are
free, legit and do not require specific infrastructure setup. Although we currently only see
APT28 using these services, it is possible that other intrusion sets may follow, as was the
case with the use of pastebin-like services to host payloads.
