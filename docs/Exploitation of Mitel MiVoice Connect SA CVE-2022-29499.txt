In April 2022, telecommunications company Mitel published a security advisory on CVE-
2022-29499, a data validation vulnerability in the Service Appliance component of MiVoice
Connect, a business communications product. The vulnerability, which was unpatched at
time of publication, arose from insufficient data validation for a diagnostic script and
potentially allowed an unauthenticated remote attacker to send specially crafted requests to
inject commands and achieve remote code execution. CVE-2022-29499 has a CVSSv3
score of 9.8.

On June 23, 2022, security firm Crowdstrike published an analysis on a ransomware
intrusion attempt that had targeted CVE-2022-29499 — which at the time of detection was
an undisclosed zero-day vulnerability — as an initial access vector. Over the past two weeks,
Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response (MDR) has also observed a small number of
intrusions that have leveraged CVE-2022-29499 as an initial access vector.

There is currently no indication that a large number of these appliances are exposed to the
public internet, and we have no evidence that this vulnerability is being targeted in wider-
scale ransomware campaigns. We are conscious of the fact, however, that the proliferation of
ransomware in general has continued to shape risk models for many organizations, and that
network perimeter devices are tempting targets for a variety of attackers.

Affected products
CVE-2022-29499 affects MiVoice Connect deployments (including earlier versions 14.2) that
include the MiVoice Connect Service Appliances, SA 100, SA 400 and/or Virtual SA.
Vulnerable firmware versions include R19.2 SP3 (22.20.2300.0) and earlier, and R14.x and
earlier. See Mitel product security advisory 22-0002 and their security bulletin for additional
information.

Mitigation guidance
Mitel MiVoice Connect customers who use vulnerable versions of the Service Appliance in
their deployments should update to a fixed version of the appliance immediately. Mitel
released patches for CVE-2022-29499 in early June 2022; organizations that have not
updated the firmware on their appliances since before that timeframe should apply fixes as

1/2



soon as possible. Appliances should not be exposed to the open internet. Administrators
should also review network filters for these devices and employ the principle of least
privilege.

Rapid7 customers
InsightVM and Nexpose customers can assess their exposure to CVE-2022-29499 with a
remote, version-based vulnerability check in the July 8, 2022 content release.
