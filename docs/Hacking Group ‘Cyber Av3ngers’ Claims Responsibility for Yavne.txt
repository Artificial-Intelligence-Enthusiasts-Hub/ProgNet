Their claim raises questions about the security of utilities and the need for advanced cybersecurity
measures.

Yavne’s Ongoing Electrical Crisis
Residents in Yavne have been dealing with frequent power outages2 affecting various neighborhoods. The
Electric Company has been quick to apologize, attributing the outages to “high voltage faults” and “damaged
infrastructure.” However, these explanations have done little to quell the residents’ frustrations.

Mayor’s Response and Public Outcry
Mayor Roi Gabbai has publicly criticized the Electric Company and the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure for
their lack of action3. “There is a serious fear of injury to the body and soul…the power outages put residents who
have ventilators and life-saving drugs in danger,” warned the mayor.

The Official Position vs. ‘Cyber Av3ngers’ Claim
While the Electric Company is attributing the issue to infrastructure problems, the ‘Cyber Av3ngers’ claim adds
another layer to the unfolding drama. Their assertion leads us to ponder: Are these power outages mere
technical glitches, or is there something more sinister at play?

The Financial Impact
According to the Mayor of Yavne, the frequent power outages have caused property damage amounting to
millions of shekels. Given the financial toll and the endangerment to lives, it becomes crucial to ascertain the true
cause behind these incidents.
