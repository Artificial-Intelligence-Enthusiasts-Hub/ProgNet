Uptycs Threat Research

The hacker collective called GhostSec has unveiled an innovative Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) framework
called GhostLocker. They provide comprehensive assistance to customers interested in acquiring this service
through a dedicated Telegram channel. Presently, GhostSec is focusing its attacks on Israel. This move represents a
surprising departure from their past activities and stated agenda.

GhostSec (aka Ghost Security) is a hacktivist group that emerged as an offshoot of Anonymous. They primarily
focused on counterterrorism efforts and monitoring online activities associated with terrorism. They gained
prominence following the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris and the rise of ISIS.  Previously dedicated to tracking
and disrupting ISIS-related online propaganda, they notably collaborate more closely with law enforcement and
intelligence agencies than their predecessor, Anonymous.

The recent turn of events raises questions about the group's current motivations and objectives.

GhostSec hacker group's cyber attacks on Israel: Historical overview
GhostSec is one of the five hacktivist groups that make up "The Five Families," alongside four other hacking
collectives as listed below.

Our threat intelligence teams have been consistently monitoring this hacker group that, over the past year, has been
responsible for cyberattacks against Israel in support of Palestine. 

Recent history of GhostSec activity:

In May 2022, the HRVAC website in Israel was hacked, resulting in the release of personal and credential data
In June 2022, the hacker group targeted telecommunication and electricity industries with successful hacks
In July 2022, the focus of the attacks was on energy and sewage systems industries
In August 2022, military data and railway system API data were exposed in a data leak
In September 2022, PLC devices became the target of the attacks
In April 2023, the focus of the attacks was on the water pump Industry
In May 2023, unauthorized access to PLC devices resulted in a data leak
In October 2023, there was an attack on water pumps alongside the deployment of GhostLocker ransomware

During November 2023, this group continuously launched cyber attacks on Israel in response to alleged war
crimes

In Figure 2, above, click on the image to view larger and zoom. This shows a timeline of Telegram communications
captured from GhostSec by the Uptycs Threat Research Team. The GhostSec communications appear to lend
support to Palestine and encourage a variety of cyberattacks on Israel, including IoT attacks on infrastructure. In one
Telegram post in October 2023, they show an unknown clip of what could be a news article or statement from Israel,
which they hold up as an indicator that “Israel is worried,” to demonstrate the power of their GhostLocker RaaS and
rally sales. 

In addition to Israel, GhostSec has targeted various other regions using different hashtags, as depicted in the
following two figures. 

In Figure 3 see a list and map displaying the countries that have been impacted by GhostSec's infections.

Threat intelligence
The hacker group promotes their Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) through a Telegram channel, offering it at an
initial price of $999. If the offer is missed, they incrementally raise the price to $4999. This Telegram channel
currently boasts approximately 688 members.

ransomware

These options are presented as follows:

Directories to encrypt - either a directory or a drive letter for encrypting files.
Kill processes - Terminate any processes, such as MS Office or targeted process
Disable services - Deactivate or disrupt any services, including antivirus (AV) or endpoint detection and
response (EDR).
Ransom amount - The ransom amount is the sum demanded by attackers for the release of encrypted data or
compromised systems. Flexible
Session ID - The session ID is used to establish a connection with the victim's machine.

6/18



Delay - The delay serves to postpone execution, aiding in avoiding detection by antivirus (AV) and endpoint
detection and response (EDR) systems.

Figure 6 – Web panel of ransom builder

The following options are presented as checkboxes:

Self-deleted - Delete the binary from victim machine
Remove background - Remove desktop background
Privilege escalation - It is the act of obtaining elevated access or permissions beyond what is typically allowed,
potentially leading to unauthorized control or access.
Persistence - Prevent from terminated/Idle process

Watchdog process - It is responsible for automatically restarting the binary if it is unexpectedly terminated,
either due to antivirus (AV) interference or an exploit.

 

Technical analysis
Stage 1 is an x64 executable binary file compiled by Python compiler Nuitka. 
Nuitka is a tool for compiling Python code to machine code for improved perfo rmance and the creation of standalone
executables. Nuitka is not a traditional compiler in the sense of converting Python to a completely different language
or binary code like C or C++ compilers. Instead, it optimizes and translates Python code into C, which is then

compiled into machine code. Unlike the commonly used Python compilers like PyInstaller and Py2exe, Nuitka, a less
commonly employed compiler, excels in terms of creating smaller compiled file sizes and enhancing resistance
against reverse engineering. This makes the Ghostlocker ransomware significantly more potent and capable.

Figure 7 – Nuitka compiler strings in

stage 1

Stage 1  drops several files in a new folder in path <%TEMP%/onefile_%PID%_%TIME%> where "PID" represents
the process ID of malware, and the folder name also includes a timestamp indicating the moment of execution. The
dropped files include dependent .pyd and dll’s  along with stage 2 executable (has same name as stage 1)

Figure 8 – Dropped

files in %temp% folder

The stage 1 file creates a child process of stage 2 using CreateProcess API. The stage 2 binary is also compiled
using Nuitka. We can  observe many strings such as nuitka_version etc indicating Nuitka compiler.

Figure 9 – Nuitka compiler strings in stage 2

The stage 2 binary is the actual ransomware executable which on execution encrypts files and appends extension
.ghost. 

 
By extracting the python script we can look at the contents inside to know what activities it is performing. It looks like
the builder has created a python script based on the options given like( kill services, watchdog etc) and compiled it to
executable using Nuitka compiler

Functions in script

Main function execution flow
The following Figure 10 illustrates the primary function of the Python script.

Figure 10 – Main function of script

Explanation of each function step-by-step
1. Copy self to startup directory

Figure 11 – startup code

2. Download watchdog: Download watchdog which starts the locker if in case it exits because of AV or any other
issue

Figure 12 – Download watchdog

When watchdog.exe is downloaded, it is launched and it drops wuachost.exe and creates its childprocess. The main
motive of  wuachost.exe is to launch the startup of stage 2 locker with admin rights. Both watchdog.exe and
wuachost.exe are Cpython compiled binary using Nuitka.

Figure 19 – Enumerating folder

Encryptfile:  Encrypts file with the given key  and appends extension “.ghost”.

Figure 20 – Encryption code

Encryption:

It employs a Fernet implementation (https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) to provide 128-bit AES-CBC
encryption for the entire contents of a specific file.

Fernet.generatekey() is used to generate a key which is sent to the hacker before encryption via
sendDB().

The key is now used to encrypt the data and generate cipher text. Cipher text or encrypted data
generated is URL-safe base64-encoded and is called or referred to as Fernet token.

Earlier, such similar ransomware were found named Cryptonite and Cyrat where ransomware code was written in
python and fernet module was used in encryption. An open source is also available related to python based
ransomware using Fernet Pyransom.

It deposits a ransom note named "Readme.html."

Conclusion
The cybersecurity landscape is continually  marred by a substantial and dynamic threat known as ransomware. The
emergence of Ransomware-as-a Service (RaaS) models, exemplified by GhostLocker, underscores the growing
sophistication of cybercriminals. These pernicious threats frequently set their sights on both individuals and
organizations, inflicting severe disruptions and financial setbacks. To shield against ransomware, it is imperative to
adopt a comprehensive defense strategy. This strategy should encompass resilient backup systems, effective
security software, user training, and a proactive incident response plan.

Precautions

Utilize trustworthy antivirus and anti-malware solutions, ensuring they are regularly updated.

 

Maintain current security patches for operating systems and software to stay protected.

 

Inform users/employees about the risks associated with clicking on unfamiliar links or downloading
questionable attachments.

 

Enforce robust email filtering to prevent malicious attachments and links from infiltrating your system.

 

Consistently observe network traffic for any abnormal or questionable behaviors.

 
Frequently back up essential data and store it in an offline location to safeguard against ransomware
encryption.
