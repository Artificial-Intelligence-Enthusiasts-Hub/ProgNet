CISA has published an additional malware analysis report associated with malicious
Barracuda activity. The report provides analysis on four malware samples, including:  

WHIRLPOOL – WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security
(TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2) server. 

For more information, including indicators of compromise and YARA rules for detection, see

SEASPY and WHIRLPOOL Backdoors MAR-10454006.r4.v2.CLEAR 

End of August 9, 2023 update 

CISA has published three malware analysis reports on malware variants associated with
exploitation of CVE-2023-2868. CVE-2023-2868 is a remote command injection vulnerability
affecting Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) Appliance, versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006.

1/2



It was exploited as a zero day as early as October 2022 to gain access to ESG appliances.
According to industry reporting, the actors exploited the vulnerability to gain initial access to
victim systems and then implanted backdoors to establish and maintain persistence.

CISA analyzed backdoor malware variants obtained from an organization that had been
compromised by threat actors exploiting the vulnerability.

Barracuda Exploit Payload and Backdoor – The payload exploits CVE-2023-2868,
leading to dropping and execution of a reverse shell backdoor on ESG appliance. The
reverse shell establishes communication with the threat actor’s command and control
(C2) server, from where it downloads the SEASPY backdoor to the ESG appliance.
The actors delivered the payload to the victim via a phishing email with a malicious
attachment.
SEASPY – SEASPY is a persistent and passive backdoor that masquerades as a
legitimate Barracuda service. SEASPY monitors traffic from the actor’s C2 server.
When the right packet sequence is captured, it establishes a Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) reverse shell to the C2 server. The shell allows the threat actors to
execute arbitrary commands on the ESG appliance.
SUBMARINE – SUBMARINE is a novel persistent backdoor executed with root
privileges that lives in a Structured Query Language (SQL) database on the ESG
appliance. SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts—including a SQL trigger, shell
scripts, and a loaded library for a Linux daemon—that together enable execution with
root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup. CISA also analyzed
artifacts related to SUBMARINE that contained the contents of the compromised SQL
database. This malware poses a severe threat for lateral movement.

the exploit payload, SEASPY, and SUBMARINE backdoor, see the following Malware
