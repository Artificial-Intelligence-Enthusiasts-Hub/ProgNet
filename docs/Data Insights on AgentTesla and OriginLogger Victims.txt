Key takeaways
AgentTesla (also known as OriginLogger) remains a prevalent commodity stealer,
being daily distributed, mainly via email attachments;
  
The primary method for exfiltrating data remains the usage of mail servers, although
Telegram utilization is increasing;
  
Available infection telemetry suggests that the most targeted countries are the United
States, China and Germany.

Malware as a Service
AgentTesla is a Windows malware written in .NET, designed to steal sensitive information
from the victim's system. It’s considered commodity malware given its accessibility and
relatively low cost. Commodity malware poses a significant threat as it enables less

sophisticated cybercriminals to conduct various types of cyberattacks without requiring
extensive technical knowledge. AgentTesla has been a persistent and widespread threat
since its emergence in 2014.

Also known as Negasteal, it was rebranded to OriginLogger (also known as AgentTesla v3 –
and beyond) in 2019. This change followed revelations by Krebs on Security in October
2018, spotlighting one of the suspected actors behind the malware, a Turkish individual –
while writing this blog post, another suspected author was revealed, a second Turkish
individual, which appears to be the actual author of the malware. The first disclosure led to
the sudden suspension of AgentTesla sales shortly thereafter. By March 2019, the
developers announced via their Discord customer support server that they were shutting
down the shop due to legal trouble but also prompted an alternative product, OriginLogger:

“If you want to see a powerful software like Agent Tesla, we would like to suggest you
OriginLogger. OriginLogger is an AT-based software and has all the features.”

OriginLogger is in fact a variant of AgentTesla, since they share the same code base.
Consequently, existing detection methods for AgentTesla are effective for identifying
OriginLogger, frequently causing OriginLogger samples to be classified as belonging to the
AgentTesla family. Similar to AgentTesla, OriginLogger operates as a licensed-based
Malware as a Service (MaaS), maintaining a presence on the clear web, using suggestive
websites such as agenttesla[.]com and originpro[.]me. Figure 1 presents the current face of
the OriginLogger website.

The website offers time-limited licenses for purchase, spanning up to six months. These
licenses grant customers access to the malware builder, enabling them to customize their
own instance of AgentTesla, including the configuration of the data exfiltration method.

With AgentTesla and OriginLogger sharing so many similarities, distinguishing between them
individually becomes quite challenging. Throughout this article, we refer to both as
AgentTesla for simplicity's sake, except when we are comparing them.

Widespread Infostealer
Since its rebranding, the malware has undergone regular updates, with the most recent one
occurring in November. It has been consistently ranked among the top charts for the most
widespread and prevalent malware, as evidenced by platforms such as ANY.RUN,
Unpac.Me, and MalwareBazaar.

Typically, AgentTesla campaigns involve phishing emails carrying malicious attachments,
oftentimes involving malware loaders down the infection chain, such as GuLoader and
PureCrypter, or as the initial infection vector, such as PrivateLoader. After all infection stages
are executed on the victim's system, the final payload initiates actions to sustain persistence,
aiming to harvest credentials, keystrokes, clipboard data, and screenshots for as long as
possible. More specifically, it harvests a wide array of sensitive information from browsers,
VPN clients, mail clients, FTP clients, VNC clients, Microsoft applications, and social media
apps. Further details regarding tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) can be found
here, here and here. This exfiltration of data can be accomplished through various protocols:
SMTP, FTP, and HTTP – which encompass the Telegram and Discord APIs, both later
introduced on the OriginLogger variant in August 2020 and October 2022 respectively.
Finally, the data is sent unencrypted to the threat actor’s server and remains there also
unencrypted.

For the past 3 months, Bitsight identified more than 1500 AgentTesla configurations (which
can be roughly translated to campaigns), extracted from samples originating from several
diverse sources, including spam campaigns. About 75% of these configurations primarily
utilize email accounts for data exfiltration, although the use of the Telegram API holds a
significant share, around 14% (Fig. 2). The last observation of a configuration using HTTP
exfiltration was in December 2022.

Exfiltrated Data Analysis
Bitsight obtained access to 3 months of victim data from about 210 campaigns of the
malware. Between October and December 2023, at least 5300 computers were
compromised. From those, we're also able to identify about 2000 IP addresses, which allow
us to geographically map their location (Fig. 3) – although these IPs are only OriginLogger
victims since IP grabbing functionality was not available in AgentTesla (older versions). The
available visibility over infected systems suggests that the most targeted country is by far the
United States, followed by China and Germany.

When looking at the types of data exfiltrated by AgentTesla, passwords were the most
commonly collected, with almost all campaigns aiming to harvest it, as figure 4 shows.

Figure 5 depicts a word cloud of the top domains for stolen credentials. The results are
consistent with expectations given the geographical distribution of infections since the
majority are from US companies, some are Chinese, such as qq.com and 163.com, and
there are also Russian, Turkish and Greek companies, including government entities.

However, this domain data reveals more the nationality of the victims rather than the country
where their computer is connected from. When we look at the most common country top
level domains (ccTLD), this data point presents a view (Fig. 6) quite different from the world
map view of victims location (Fig. 3), where it suggests that most victims have most likely ties
with European countries (Turkey, Italy, Russia, Poland, Greece, Romania, Germany and
Spain)

Logs exploitation

8/9



When all the mentioned data, also referred to as “logs” in the cybercriminal world, is
collected by a financially motivated threat actor, it’s either exploited or sold for further
exploitation. For direct exploitation, threat actors generally use authentication information
(cookie or password credentials) to transfer money, cryptocurrencies or any other valuable
asset from the victims’ accounts to their own. Beyond direct exploitation, these actors use
the acquired data for other profit-driven schemes, such as ransomware attacks – often
resulting in data breaches, as in the Uber’s case – and business email compromise (BEC)
attacks. The latter involves cybercriminals manipulating or impersonating trusted individuals
within a company via email to deceive employees into taking actions that compromise
security or financial integrity. For instance, the threat actor intercepts an email between two
parties involved in a transaction and modifies financial documents to direct funds to their
bank accounts. As a matter of fact, AgentTesla malware has been utilized by a syndicate of
Nigerian fraudsters to reroute financial transactions from corporate organizations, including
oil and gas companies in South East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.

Wrap-up
In conclusion, AgentTesla, a Windows malware operating under a Malware as a Service
model, has proven to be a persistent threat since 2014. Its rebranding as OriginLogger and
widespread campaigns highlight its adaptability and pervasiveness. Recent data analysis
reveals thousands of victims, primarily in the United States, China, and Germany, with vast
amounts of credentials exfiltrated. The stolen data not only poses a direct financial threat but
also fuels ransomware and business email compromise attacks. In the landscape of evolving
cyber threats, while addressing the threat posed by malware as a service models is an
important part of securing digital environments, it's also important to complement efforts
against these specific threats with a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. This strategy
should encompass a multi-layered defense approach, proactive threat detection, employee
awareness programs, and continuous adaptation to effectively be defended against a
spectrum of cyber risks.
