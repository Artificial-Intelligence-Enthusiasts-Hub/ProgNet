Ransomware group Ransomed.vc claims to have successfully breached Sony Group and is
threatening to sell a cache of data stolen from the Japanese company.

While its claims remain unverified, Cyber Security Connect reports that the relative
ransomware newcomer “has racked up an impressive amount of victims” since bursting onto
the scene last month.

“We have successfully compromissed [sic] all of sony systems,” the group claimed on both
the clear and dark nets. “We won’t ransom them! We will sell the data. Due to Sony not
wanting to pay. DATA IS FOR SALE.”

In response to claims it’s been hacked, Sony has said it’s “investigating the situation”.

According to Cyber Security Connect, the group has posted some proof-of-hack data,
although it says this is “not particularly compelling information on the face of things”.

It includes what appear to be screenshots of an internal log-in page, an internal PowerPoint
presentation, several Java files, and a file tree of the leak which seemingly includes fewer
than 6,000 files.

The group listed a “post date” of September 28, after which if nobody purchases the data, is
presumably when Ransomed.vc will publish the data wholesale.

Ransomed.vc is said to be both a ransomware operator and a ransomware-as-a-service
organisation.

It claims to be a “secure solution for addressing data security vulnerabilities within
companies”, and also to be operating “in strict compliance with GDPR and Data Privacy
Laws”.

“In cases where payment is not received, we are obligated to report a Data Privacy Law
violation to the GDPR agency!” the group says.

Most of the Ransomed.vc’s members reportedly operate out of Ukraine and Russia.

VGC has contacted Sony for comment on this report and will update it if we hear back from
the company.

In 2011, Sony’s PlayStation Network suffered a massive breach that resulted in the personal
details of approximately 77 million accounts being compromised and the service being taken
offline for 23 days.

Sony initially estimated the hack would cost it more than $100m, and it was forced to
apologise not only to players, but developers whose game launches were disrupted or
whose online services were left unavailable.

Sony eventually faced as many as 55 class action lawsuits and agreed to offer compensation
for those affected, including free games.

“You are the lifeblood of the company,” PlayStation‘s US boss Jack Tretton said at the time.
“Without you, there is no PlayStation. I want to apologise personally. It’s you that causes us
to be humbled and amazed by the support you continue to give.”

To Sony’s third-party publishing partners, Tretton said: “I know the outage has been costly.
We wouldn’t be where we are without you”. He added: “We are committed more than ever to
making sure the PlayStation experience is entertaining and secure for everybody”.
