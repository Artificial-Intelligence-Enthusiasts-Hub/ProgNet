Backchannel Diplomacy: APT29’s Rapidly Evolving Diplomatic
Phishing Operations

mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt29-evolving-diplomatic-phishing

Key Insights
APT29’s pace of operations and emphasis on Ukraine increased in the first half of 2023 as Kyiv launched
its counteroffensive, pointing to the SVR’s central role in collecting intelligence concerning the current
pivotal phase of the war.
During this period, Mandiant has tracked substantial changes in APT29’s tooling and tradecraft, likely
designed to support the increased frequency and scope of operations and hinder forensic analysis. 
APT29 has used various infection chains simultaneously across different operations, indicating that distinct
initial access operators or subteams are possibly operating in parallel to service different regional targets
or espionage objectives.

Threat Detail
During the lead up to Ukraine's counteroffensive, Mandiant and Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) have
tracked an increase in the frequency and scope of APT29 phishing operations. Investigations into the group’s
recent activity have identified an intensification of operations centered on foreign embassies in Ukraine. Notably,
as part of this activity, we have seen phishing emails targeting a wide range of diplomatic representations in Kyiv
including those of Moscow’s partners, representing the first time we have observed this cluster of APT29 activity

pursuing governments strategically aligned with Russia. Based on the timing and focus of APT29’s Ukraine-
focused operations, we judge they are intended to aid Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) in intelligence
collection concerning the current pivotal phase of the war. 

APT29’s increased phishing activity in Ukraine has occurred alongside an uptick in the group’s more routine
espionage operations against global diplomatic entities. Across these malware delivery operations, APT29
continues to prioritise European Ministries of Foreign Affairs and embassies, but it has also sustained operations
that are global in scope and illustrative of Russia’s far-reaching ambitions and interests in other regions. The
current secondary focus is concentrated in Asia, with governments in Türkiye (formerly known as Turkey), India,
and other regions of vital strategic importance to Moscow such as Africa factoring into its 2023 priorities. We
judge that Russia’s war in Ukraine has almost certainly shaped APT29’s espionage priorities, but it has not
supplanted them. 

We track this diplomatic-focused phishing activity as operationally distinct from APT29’s ongoing initial access
operations targeting cloud-based Microsoft products. Although APT29’s cloud-focused exploitation may lead to
the compromise of diplomatic entities, variance in the scale, quality and targeting patterns of the two lines of
effort indicate that they are highly likely distinct initial access clusters operating with different priorities and levels
of capability. However, we continue to see significant overlap in post-compromise methods across both lines of
effort, indicating that multiple initial access teams may hand-off to a centralized exploitation team once inside a
victim environment.

Figure 1: APT29’s distinct initial access clusters
Alongside the increased pace of operations and changes in targeting, we have also seen a major shift in the
group’s tooling and tradecraft. APT29 has rebuilt several of its tools and has made repeated iterative
modifications to its existing malware delivery chain, likely to ensure its operational longevity despite long-term
persistent use. We assess that several of these changes are highly likely specifically designed to sidestep
research methods and tools commonly used by the threat intelligence community to track their operations,
indicating that operational security priorities continue to factor heavily into APT29’s tooling decisions.

APT29’s Evolving Approach to Malware Delivery
Starting in 2021, APT29 adopted a tactic called HTML smuggling in its malware delivery operations, hiding its
first-stage JavaScript dropper in malicious HTML attachments we call ROOTSAW (also known as EnvyScout).
As detailed in previous research by Mandiant, CERT-Polska, Palo Alto Networks and others, ROOTSAW has
been a constant feature of APT29's operations over the past two years and has been the primary vehicle to
decode and deliver the group’s next stage malware.  Upon opening the archive file, victims are presented with
either a Windows shortcut (LNK) file or a legitimate software binary, that when opened, executes an
accompanying DLL, leading to commodity backdoors such as BEACON or BRC4 (Brute Ratel C4) executing on
the system. 

2/23



ROOTSAW’s central and continued role in APT29 operations has spurred changes to the malware delivery
chain over time. The most visible change has been the move away from HTML attachments as the initial
infection vector, with APT29 shifting to hosting its first-stage payloads on compromised web services such as
WordPress sites. Migrating the first-stage payload server side has likely provided APT29 a greater degree of
control over its malware delivery chain and allowed the group to be more judicious about the exposure of its
later-stage capabilities. For example, to prevent detection of malware in environments not intended for
compromise, APT29 has implemented various forms of filtering in its first-stage payloads and has removed
staged malware from compromised servers shortly after operational use. Notably, these efforts have also
prevented payloads being acquired by public malware repositories and other common security research tools,
helping to avoid detection and extend the operational lifespan of its newer malware variants.

Figure 2: APT29’s diverse first-stage delivery methods
As shown  the following campaigns tracked throughout the first half of 2023 detail, APT29 has made continuous,
iterative efforts to introduce additional obfuscation and anti-analysis components into its operations. The group
has experimented with various obfuscation techniques such as the use of JavaScript Obfuscator, delivery and

execution guardrails, hosting decryption keys server side, and delivering decoy documents when victim profiling
checks fail. In this accelerated period of tooling evolution, the group has also begun to rotate in novel malware
delivery tools and techniques instead of its mainstay first-stage payload. 

March 2023: Earthquake-Themed Türkiye Campaign
In March 2023, Mandiant identified a new APT29 phishing campaign targeting Türkiye. The phishing waves
impersonated the Turkish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and included a phishing link accompanied by
content related to the February 2023 earthquake that struck southern Türkiye. 

The first wave, conducted in early March, used a phishing link generated by a URL shortening service
“https://tinyurl[.]com/mrxcjsbs” to redirect victims to a ROOTSAW dropper hosted on an actor-controlled
compromised website “https://www.willyminiatures[.]com/e-yazi.htm/?v=bc78a8d162c6”.

When visited, the URL downloaded the ROOTSAW dropper "e-yazi.htm" (MD5:
a3067a0262e651e94329869f43a51722) to drop additional files onto the victim machine, including a
malicious ISO, "e-yazi.iso" (MD5: eeded26943a7b2fdef7608fb21bbfd66).
This is the first time Mandiant has seen APT29 introduce an additional layer of obfuscation to its
phishing links using a URL shortening service. 

The second wave, victims were directed to an actor-controlled compromised website
“https://simplesalsamix[.]com/e-yazi.html” to download the ROOTSAW dropper "e-yazi.html" (MD5:
b051e8efb40c2c435d77f3be77c59488). 

The second ROOTSAW sample dropped similar decoy content and a malicious ZIP file, e-yazi.zip
(MD5: 854e5c592e93b69b8ab08dbc8a0b673f), that contained second-stage downloaders and an
additional ROOTSAW dropper file.

In both waves, APT29 incorporated a new version of ROOTSAW with added user-agent based anti-analysis
guardrails. This variant checks the user-agent of the device, looking for Windows operating systems that do not
contain “.NET” and contain the value “Windows NT”. As a result, if the victim is running a non-Windows based
operating system or the request is made through .NET, the server will deliver a decoy PDF file. In the second
wave, this PDF file was identical to the version contained in the malicious ZIP payload. This filtering tactic is
likely used to identify automated downloaders and non-compatible victim devices, further reducing the odds of
exposing malware in non-compromise contexts. Each payload within the new ROOTSAW variant is obfuscated
using a unique key, although the deobfuscation routine remains the same.

March 2023: European Diplomatic-Focused Phishing Campaigns
In an additional phishing campaign in March 2023, APT29 targeted various diplomatic missions in Europe.
Notably, in the two weeks that lapsed between the Turkey campaign, further changes were identified resulting in
two new variants of ROOTSAW that shifted the newly added anti-analysis guardrails server side.

5/23



In the first wave, emails contained a PDF attachment (MD5: 1485b591e654327c1d032a901940b149)
inviting victims to a drink reception following an event on the “Future of International Economic Relations”
from the Embassy of Spain. The PDF contains a link to an actor-hosted ROOTSAW variant hosted at
“https://parquesanrafael[.]cl/note.html”, ultimately leading to the deployment of MUSKYBEAT (also known
publicly as QUARTERRIG).

This version of ROOTSAW sends the victim’s user-agent to the compromised server using an HTTP
GET request “https://parquesanrafael[.]cl/note.php?ua=<value>”.  The server then performs filtering
based on an actor-defined denylist, finally returning a decryption key for the payload if the tests are
successfully passed. 
If these tests fail, ROOTSAW drops a corrupt file, rather than exposing the embedded decoy file like
in previous versions.  

In the second wave, APT29 delivered an additional new variant of ROOTSAW (MD5:
0d5b12c50173a176b0a8ba5a97a831d8), containing both user-agent and IP filtering, but ultimately leading
to the same MUSKYBEAT downloader. 

This version conducts an additional check by obtaining the victim’s IP address through a request to a
public API service “https://api.ipify[.]org/?format=json”.

 April 2023: Old Wine in a New Bottle
In April 2023, APT29 continued to modify its standard malware delivery chain, introducing a new technique for
malware delivery. In this operation, APT29 re-used one its frequent diplomatic event-themed lure documents
spoofing the Czechia Embassy (more commonly known as the Czech Republic) that invited targets to a wine
tasting event on April 13, 2023. The document contained a link to the phishing website
“https://sylvio[.]com[.]br/form.php”, which delivered either an ISO or a ZIP archive to the victim. 

Rather than using ROOTSAW, victims were delivered a malicious ISO or ZIP file directly from the
compromised web server if they successfully passed the server-side filtering checks. 
The decision to remove the HTML smuggling stage of the infection chain was likely intended to further
reduce the number of forensic artifacts left on the host that are prone to detection or later analysis.

May 2023: Ukraine Foreign Embassy-Focused Campaigns
In May, in the lead up to Ukraine’s counteroffensive, APT29 conducted two distinct phishing waves targeting a
wide range of diplomatic representations in Kyiv, including those of Moscow’s partners. Each campaign adopted
separate intrusion chains similar to those seen in March and April 2023. 

6/23



In the first wave in early May, an repurposed advert for a BMW sale in Kyiv was circulated, directing victims
to an actor-controlled server at “https://resetlocations[.]com/bmw.htm”, which delivered a weaponized ISO
file, "bmw.iso" (MD5: e306333093eaf198f4d416d25a40784a).

The version of ROOTSAW used in this campaign shares similarities to variants used in March
against Türkiye. Depending on user-agent filtering, the ISO or a decoy image of the BMW would be
displayed.

In the second wave mid-May, an invite for a charity concert in Kyiv with a mistyped filename
“Invintation.zip” (MD5: 38719acc6254b7ff70dc8a7723bd8e92) was sent to targets, likely also using a copy
of a legitimate document.  

Similar to the April wine-themed campaign, payloads were hosted directly on actor-controlled
infrastructure that used user-agent filtering to deliver either a ZIP file with decoy PDF documents
(MD5:38719acc6254b7ff70dc8a7723bd8e92), or a ZIP file containing a second-stage payloads
(MD5:1aee5bf23edb7732fd0e6b2c61a959ce) to victims.

June 2023: Split ROOTSAW Campaign

8/23



In late June, Mandiant identified an additional APT29 phishing campaign with a new variant of ROOTSAW to
target a European government. Phishing emails were sent from a compromised North American government
email address and crafted to appear as an invitation to a public holiday celebration from Norwegian embassy
personnel. Two different delivery mechanisms were used in this campaign, a PDF (MD5:
b4141aa8d234137f0b9549a448158a95) containing a link to an actor-hosted ROOTSAW variant, and emails with
an attached Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) file (MD5: 295527e2e38da97167979ade004de880) rather than the
typical HTML payload.

Notably, although APT29 used a compromised WordPress server to host the ROOTSAW payload, non-
valid targets received a generic HTTP 404 error rather than the traditional WordPress 404.  
Mandiant has identified that once APT29 removes the server side functionality, the compromised
WordPress site will start displaying the correct WordPress 404 error indicating that the file was not found.
We therefore suspect that organisations compromised by APT29 to deliver malware will likely not find logs
for this activity within WordPress, although they may exist within other services such as the underlying web
server. 
The ROOTSAW variant contained in the SVG file is similar to those first identified in 2021, indicating that
the threat actor may have only recently adopted SVG files for its HTML smuggling technique. Consistent
with other cases where APT29 has introduced new delivery methods for ROOTSAW, the group reverted to
a primitive ROOTSAW payload without anti-analysis techniques or other forms of hardening.

July 2023: ICEBEAT Campaign
In July, APT29 continued to experiment with new ROOTSAW delivery mechanisms and victim filtering
capabilities in an operation deploying a new downloader ICEBEAT to target European diplomatic entities. Emails
were sent purporting to be an invite from a non-specified German embassy for an Ambassador’s farewell
reception. Of note, ICEBEAT’s use of the open source Zulip messaging platform for command and control (C2)
follows a pattern of past APT29 downloaders using legitimate services for command and control including
Dropbox, Firebase, OneDrive and Trello.

For the first time in this campaign, ROOTSAW was contained within a PDF document. When opened, the
PDF document writes an HTML file to disk, that when launched, writes a follow-on ZIP file to disk and
beacons to an actor controlled domain “https://sgrfh[.]org.pk/wp-content/idx.php?n=ks&q=
<execution_path>” to profile victim information. 
Victims who met filtering requirements were delivered a Save the date decoy PDF document (MD5:
50f57a4a4bf2c4b504954a36d48c99e7) and delivered the next-stage downloader ICEBEAT that is
responsible for downloading follow-on capabilities from the Zulip messaging service. 
In instances where the victim did not meet filtering requirements, a separate benign decoy document
referencing German Unity Day (MD5: ffce57940b0257a72db4969565cbcebc) was delivered in place of
ICEBEAT.

Malware Choices Possibly Reflect Distinct APT29 Subteams 
Beyond the continued adaptation of APT29’s malware delivery chain, Mandiant has also observed dedicated
efforts to update and evolve the group’s later-stage malware into multiple variations, increasing the quantity and
quality of tooling used across its campaigns. At least six distinct downloaders have been identified during the
first half of 2023: 

11/23



BURNTBATTER is an in-memory loader responsible for decrypting and executing a payload from disk into
a running process. BURNTBATTER has been witnessed loading the SPICYBEAT downloader via a
position-independent shellcode dropper called DONUT.
DONUT is a publicly available tool that creates position-independent shellcode that loads .NET
assemblies, PE files, and other Windows payloads from memory and runs them with parameters.
SPICYBEAT is a downloader written in C++ responsible for downloading a next-stage payload from either
DropBox or Microsoft's OneDrive.
MUSKYBEAT is an in-memory dropper that decodes the next-stage payload and strings using RC4 and
executes in the current process.
STATICNOISE is a downloader written in C responsible for downloading and executing the final-stage
payload in memory.

DAVESHELL is shellcode that functions as an in-memory dropper relying on reflective injection. Its embedded
payload is mapped into memory and executed. DAVESHELL is based in the public available repository.

12/23



As noted in the June 2023 campaign, we have also witnessed APT29 operating various infection chains
simultaneously within a single campaign, suggesting that distinct initial access operators or subteams may be
operating in parallel to service different regional targets or espionage objectives. Although we have been unable
to ascertain the specific logic behind decisions about which malware delivery approach to use or when to
introduce new later-stage malware variants, we judge with low confidence that they are likely driven by mission-
specific parameters such as targets or operational objectives.

The first use of new capabilities are typically reserved for targets inside Ukraine or diplomatic entities
associated with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or European Union (EU) member states, areas
of likely heightened strategic importance given Moscow’s need to understand political and military
dynamics surrounding its war in Ukraine.
Upon first use of new tactics or tools in higher risk environments, we have observed APT29 incorporate
these new tools into its broader operations with minimal changes, pointing to the group’s possible changing
risk calculus after first exposure. 
Patterns of controlled first-use possibly extend back to the emergence of APT29’s diplomatic-focused
phishing cluster in 2021. In May 2021, during Russia’s initial troop-build up around Ukraine, Mandiant
identified an APT29 operation using ICEBREAKER, a modified variant of BOOMMIC (also known as
VaporRage) embedded in software mimicking an installer for a legitimate Ukrainian government
application. As detailed by SentinelOne, multiple aspects of the malware delivery chain were likely tailored
for a highly-targeted operation against Ukrainian government entities.

Conclusions
The increased scope and frequency of APT29's diplomatic-focused spear phishing campaigns in the first half of
2023 has compelled the initial access team to make repeated modifications to its long-standing malware delivery
chain. Efforts to move capabilities server side, introduce anti-analysis components, and deliver decoy
documents in non-compromise contexts have likely helped the group extend the shelf-life of its ROOTSAW-
centred concept of operations. Even with this unprecedented pace of change, the group has remained highly
operational security conscious, and has taken repeated steps to circumvent the methods that security
researchers use to track and respond to its activity. 

APT29's increased operational tempo has also exposed patterns of operations that likely reflect different initial
access operators or subteams supported by a centralized development team. More generally, these patterns
likely reflect a growing mission and pool of resources dedicated to collecting political intelligence and that group
will almost certainly continue to pose a high severity threat to governments and diplomatic entities globally.

Protecting The Community
As part of our efforts to combat serious threat actors, TAG uses the results of our research to improve the safety
and security of Google’s products. Upon discovery, all identified websites and domains are added to Safe
Browsing to protect users from further exploitation. TAG also sends all targeted Gmail and Workspace users
government-backed attacker alerts notifying them of the activity and encourages potential targets to enable
Enhanced Safe Browsing for Chrome and ensure that all devices are updated. Where possible, Mandiant sends
victim notifications via the Victim Notification Program. We are committed to sharing our findings with the
security community to raise awareness, and with companies and individuals that might have been targeted by
these activities. We hope that improved understanding of tactics and techniques will enhance threat hunting
capabilities and lead to stronger user protections across the industry.
