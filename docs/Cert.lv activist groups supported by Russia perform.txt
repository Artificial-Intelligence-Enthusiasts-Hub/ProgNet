On Monday, the 4th of September, activist groups supported by Russia performed
wide-scale cyber attacks on Latvian state finance and healthcare institutions, as
reported by Cert.lv.

So far there have been phishing attacks performed on e-mails of users in state
administration.

Cert.lv invites users to check and make sure their e-mail authorisation system uses a
multi-factor authentication.

There are also reports about web defacement using vulnerabilities in targeted systems, as
well as possible destructive (encrypted ransomware) attacks on Latviaâ€™s healthcare sector.
