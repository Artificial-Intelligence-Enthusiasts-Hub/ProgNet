Further Insight into the Hacktivist Operation Targeting NATO and
Affiliated Nations

Key Findings
 

1/17



NoName057(16) is a pro-Russian hacktivist operator / group, which has claimed
responsibility for repeated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against entities
in perceived anti-Russian countries since March 2022.

NoName057(16) back-end infrastructure is hosted in Russia and likely operated by
individual(s) with experience in systems design / maintenance.

DDoS attack targeting instructions include timestamps that align with Moscow Standard
Time.

Recent targets have included entities with infrastructure hosted in Czechia, Denmark,
Estonia, Germany, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

The majority of DDoS attack infrastructure used in NoName057(16) campaigns is
assigned to two interlinked hosting providers; MIRhosting and Stark Industries.

A limited number of netblocks are used in the DDoS attacks, providing a potential
mitigation / defense opportunity

 

Introduction
 

NoName057(16) attacks have targeted government / military departments in Ukraine and
NATO countries, as well as organizations from core sectors such as finance, freight, and
media.

 

Recent reporting (Avast, SentinelLabs) has revealed that NoName057(16) relies upon a
“volunteer” system (rather than a botnet of infected hosts), in which the “volunteers” are
rewarded financially for contributing attack infrastructure. This system is managed via two
Telegram channels (@noname05716 and @nn05716chat).

 

In this blog post we will examine two elements of NoName057(16)’s infrastructure; the
management infrastructure sitting behind the known C2 servers, and the attack infrastructure
which is purportedly donated by their “volunteers”. In doing so we will seek to understand
how the operation functions, and provide information for cyber defenders to protect their
interests from future attacks.

Infrastructure
 

The starting point for this analysis is the current C2 server used to coordinate
NoName057(16)’s campaigns; as previously reported by SentinelLabs - 31.13.195.87
(NETERRA, BG). According to our records this server became operational on 19 December
2022.

 

Two Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains, registered with No-IP, currently resolve to
31.13.195.87:

 

tom56gaz6poh13f28[.]myftp.org

zig35m48zur14nel40[.]myftp.org

 

The DDoS tool (DDOSIA) receives targeting information from the /client/get_targets URL
path on either of these domains (over HTTP on TCP/80).

 

Examining network telemetry for 31.13.195.87, we observe a high volume of outbound
connections to TCP/5001 of 87.121.52.9 (NETERRA, BG).

 

The use of TCP/5001 is notable as this port was used for communications with the previous
C2 server (77.91.122.69), which was active until 16 December 2022.

 

When '87.121.52.9:5001/client/get_targets' was accessed, we noted that the same targeting
information was returned, as observed on the C2 domains. It is therefore plausible that the
published C2 servers are mirrors of 87.121.52.9.

 

3/17



Figure 1: Targeting Information

 

Pivoting to examine network telemetry for 87.121.52.9, we observe a number of interesting
communications.

 

Telegram
 

Regular connections are made to api.telegram[.]org, potentially indicative of Telegram bot
interactions. It is possible that these connections relate to updates made to the Telegram
channels associated with NoName057(16)’s DDoS campaigns.

 

CLOUDASSETS, RU
 

A high volume of traffic is observed to two IP addresses assigned to CLOUDASSETS, RU
(AS212441).

 

109.107.184.11

 

Connections are made to TCP/27017 of 109.107.184.11, this port is commonly associated
with MongoDB. It is likely that data transferred from the attack infrastructure is stored in a
database hosted on this IP address.

4/17



 

185.173.37.220

 

Connections are made to TCP/5672 and TCP/6379 of 185.173.37.220, these ports are
commonly associated with RabbitMQ and Redis respectively. This host is therefore likely
used to store events / commands from the operator(s) of this infrastructure.

 

It is plausible that further operator hosts sit beyond this IP address, to either update or read
messages from the RabbitMQ bus, however due to the geolocation of 185.173.37.220 further
upstream insights are not available.

 

In addition to the outbound connections, inbound traffic to local ports TCP/5051 and
TCP/9100 was observed, sourced from 91.142.79.201 (also CLOUDASSETS, RU). Pivoting
on 91.142.79.201, additional traffic was also observed sourced from this IP to TCP/9100 of
31.13.195.87 (the original C2 server).

 

TCP/9100 is commonly associated with Prometheus Node Exporter, a platform used for
collecting metrics / alerts from remote servers. Indeed, open ports information for
31.13.195.87:9100 shows an instance of Node Exporter running as of the time of writing.

 

5/17



Figure 2: Open Ports Data for 31.13.195.87 - Censys

 

91.142.79.201 is therefore likely used for monitoring the operator’s infrastructure and
collecting metrics on usage; possibly providing updates on campaign effectiveness and the
number of active ‘bots’.

 

In a few instances, we also observed 91.142.79.201 making connections to TCP/9100 of IP
addresses used in the attack infrastructure of NoName057(16)’s operation.

 

When reviewing the infrastructure in its totality, it is clear that the operator(s) behind
NoName057(16) is familiar with systems design / maintenance; potentially pointing towards a
threat actor(s) with legitimate work experience in this area.

Targeting
 

Previous reporting on NoName057(16) has highlighted DDoS attacks against an array of
targets across business sectors and nations, including government / military departments.

 

At the time of writing this report, we took a look at the ‘current’ targets of the operation; one
which stood out was the Estonian Ministry of Finance, with a particular subdomain being
targeted.

 

7/17



Figure 4: Targeting Details for the Estonian Ministry of Finance

 

From this entry on the C2 target list, we can see that a domain hosted on xx.xx.xx.246 is the
target of the attack, which was set to commence at 10:00 on 25 January 2023.

 

We initially assumed this meant 10:00 UTC, however, when looking into our threat telemetry
for xx.xx.xx.246 the attack appears to have commenced at 07:00 UTC; so the start time in
the C2 target list in fact refers to UTC+3, which happens to coincide with Moscow Standard

8/17



Time.

 

 

As of 17:00 UTC on 25 January 2023 the target subdomain was displaying a ‘down for
maintenance’ message, likely indicating that the attack had achieved a degree of success.

 

Figure 5: Maintenance Message

 

Returning to the aforementioned threat telemetry data for this target, the DDoS attack is
evident in the data; which we have mapped below looking at the last seven days of traffic
to/from xx.xx.xx.246 (19 - 25 January 2023).

 

9/17



Figure 6: DDoS Attack Data - Target One

 

As of 17:00 UTC on 25 January, we can see that the attack began at 07:00 UTC (as
mentioned previously), with a peak in activity between 08:00 UTC - 09:00 UTC, and a large
volume of traffic has been received since that time; significantly outside the usual expected
norms for this IP address.

 

Looking at a previous Estonian target from the same seven-day time period, we see that the
attack lasted for 24 hours, commencing and ending at 07:00 UTC. As previously, activity
peaked in the first few hours of the attack; this period is likely when the DDoS is most
effective, before mitigating actions can be undertaken.

 

10/17



Figure 7: DDoS Attack Data - Target Two

 

Overall, since the beginning of 2023, we have been able to confirm attacks against entities
with infrastructure hosted in Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

 

Attack Infrastructure
 

When examining the data for the DDoS attacks against the two Estonian targets, we found
that 99.8% of the traffic inbound to the second (earlier) target was sourced from IP
addresses which had later been used in the attack on the first target.

 

11/17



Whilst IPs assigned to 21 distinct ASNs were observed in this ‘common’ dataset, 98.6% of
the traffic originated from IPs assigned to STARK-INDUSTRIES, GB. Looking further into the
data, IPs residing in two /24 netblocks were responsible for over 65% of this traffic:

 

5.182.39.0/24 (38 IPs)

94.131.106.0/24 (21 IPs)

 

STARK-INDUSTRIES, GB relates to a hosting company ‘Stark Industries Solutions Ltd’
which was incorporated in the United Kingdom through Companies House on 10 February
2022, by Moldovan national Ivan NECULITI. NECULITI is further associated with several
other hosting companies; including MIRhosting and Perfect Quality (PQ) Hosting, which are
purported to operate from the Netherlands and Moldova respectively.

 

We frequently observe all three hosting companies being used to host malicious content, or
as in this case, used directly for attack infrastructure. The website hucksters[.]net, which
amongst other things seeks to expose individuals involved in fraud and spam, has previously
profiled NECULITI.

 

Note, we have seen no evidence which associates NECULITI directly with these
malicious activities; nor do we intend to insinuate that he is connected in any way
with nefarious pursuits in general. This data point is mentioned as it exists on the
public record and is the common tie between the hosting companies highlighted.

 

Pivoting back to the C2 server (31.13.195.87), by examining all inbound connections to
TCP/80 since 19 December 2022, when it became operational, we are able to extract a more
complete picture of the attack infrastructure.

 

This process is caveated by the fact that other ‘non attack infrastructure’ connections are
likely to have been made to 31.13.195.87:80, particularly since the publication of this IP as a
C2 server for NoName057(16) activities. However, the idea here is to identify likely attack
infrastructure based on the regularity and volume of traffic, and any emerging patterns, for
example sequential IPs within the same netblock as seen in the two attacks above.

12/17



 

In total we observed IPs assigned to 83 distinct ASNs communicating with 31.13.195.87:80.
However, once again infrastructure associated with the previously referenced hosting
provider(s) dominated, with 84% of all communications originating from IPs assigned to
either MIRhosting or Stark Industries.

 

Figure 8: Top-10 Observed ASNs

 

Looking a little further into this data, IPs residing in a limited number of netbooks generated
the majority of the traffic; the top 10 netblocks accounting for 68% of the total.

 

13/17



Figure 9: Top-10 Observed Netblocks

 

5.182.39.0/24, as observed in the data for the Estonian attacks, is the clear number one, the
other netblock from that data (94.131.106.0/24) was just outside the top-ten at number
thirteen.

 

What was notable was the fact that many of the IPs had been in communication with
31.13.195.87 since 19 December 2022, continuing up to the time of writing; indicating a
broadly static attack infrastructure.

 

Conclusion
 

14/17



In this post we have examined the infrastructure used to manage the DDoS attacks
attributed to NoName057(16); demonstrating a well-thought out structure which includes
capacity for monitoring, tasking, and remote storage of data.

 

As a pro-Russian hacktivist operation, it is no surprise that there are several pointers to a
Russian nexus; the use of Russian hosting providers for the management infrastructure, and
the use of Moscow Standard Time for targeting instructions.

 

From our observations, whilst heavily focused on a small number of specific targets,
NoName057(16) has had some successes in temporarily disrupting web services, with
evidence of their targets being offline or ‘under maintenance’. The broader impacts of these
attacks will likely remain limited providing there is no major escalation of activities / or growth
in available attack infrastructure.

 

That brings us to the most significant finding in this blog; the static and limited nature of the
attack infrastructure which has been utilized by NoName057(16) to date. For an operation
which is labeled as “volunteer” driven; the fact that so much of the infrastructure is sourced
from one provider raises questions.

 

Is a sizeable chunk donated by one generous “volunteer”?

How many “volunteers” actively contribute to the operation?

Are NoName057(16) propping up their operation with infrastructure they have procured
themselves?

 

We have observed a diverse range of IPs being utilized in attacks, but the volume of traffic
related to the majority of these IPs is minimal; if you were to deduct the traffic sourced from
IPs assigned to Stark Industries there is a question as to what impact the attacks would
have.

 

With all this being said, we will continue to monitor NoName057(16)’s activities, providing
updates via our Twitter and Mastodon pages.
