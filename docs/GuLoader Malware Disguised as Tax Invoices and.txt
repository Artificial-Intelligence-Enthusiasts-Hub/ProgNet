Shipping Statements (Detected by MDS Products)

AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) has identified circumstances of
GuLoader being distributed as attachments in emails disguised with tax invoices and
shipping statements. The recently identified GuLoader variant was included in a RAR
(Roshal Archive Compressed) compressed file. When a user executes GuLoader, it
ultimately downloads known malware strains such as Remcos, AgentTesla, and Vidar.

AhnLab’s MDS products provide a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) feature to block malware
distributed via email. Figure 3 below shows the GuLoader malware detection report screen of
AhnLab MDS. In this case, the GuLoader downloader downloaded Remcos from the threat
actor’s server.

Remcos is a known RAT (Remote Administration Tool) distributed via spam emails and MS-
SQL vulnerabilities. The malware has been covered on the ASEC Blog.

(Nov 23, 2020) Remcos RAT Malware being Distributed as Spam Mail 

There is an official sales page for Remcos. Following the initial release of version 1.0 in July
2016, version 4.9.0 was released on July 26th, 2023. It seems the creator is constantly
updating the features of this malware and selling copies for commercial purposes.

When an email is received, MDS uses the virtual machine-based dynamic analysis to detect
malware strains based on GuLoader’s behavior of downloading malware types and Remcos’
behavior of exfiltrating information as well as their characteristics.

Besides Remcos, GuLoader also downloads and runs malware strains being sold on the
Internet such as Formbook and Lokibot. Such malware strains offered for sale are called
commodity malware. The threat actor likely uses downloaders such as GuLoader to
propagate commercial malware instead of distributing them directly to bypass signature-
based detection of security products. In the past, GuLoader was compiled in VisualBasic,
and nowadays, it is compiled in NSIS and .NET. Whatever the case may be, its form is
constantly being changed during distribution to evade static detection. However, the malware
strains being executed in the memory area are commercial malware types such as Remcos,
so even if the forms are different, each variant performs the same malicious behaviors. Thus,
corporate security managers must implement not only endpoint security products (V3) but
also sandbox-based APT solutions such as MDS to prevent damage from cyber attacks.
