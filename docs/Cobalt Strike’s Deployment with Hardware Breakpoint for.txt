Recently came across a tweet regarding a LNK file creating a hardware breakpoint in the
Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI).

 In this blog, we will get into the dig a little deeper into Cobalt Strike’s New TTP for
bypassing the AMSI using hardware breakpoint.

Initial access
LECmd tool was used to extract LNK file’s argument, which invokes a PowerShell to get
the code from the malicious site.

Figure 2: lnk File 
 In this code a hardware breakpoint (Dr0) was enabled in the address of AMSI scan buffer.

 Figure 3: Hardware breakpoint in AMSI
In order to bypass AMSI, an exception handler for the AMSI scan buffer’s breakpoint is
registered using  AddVectoredExceptionHandler API. In the Handler Code it collects the
exception records and the Exception Address. Then proceeds further only if the exception
has occurred in the address of AMSI Scan Buffer. Then it stores the Stack pointer value in
the return address, it sets return address in the instruction pointer and return value as 0.

Figure 4: Exception Handler code
This code contains a PowerShell script to create persistence using the startup folder and
download a GZIP compressed Base64 String . It targets only Domain logon users who
have connected in the mentioned domain list.

By decompressing this Base64 String with GUnZip, there is another code as shown in
Figure 6.

   Figure 6: XOR encoded Base64 string
This code contains Base64 String which when decoded and XORed int(35) gives out the
final Cobalt Strike Payload as shown in Figure 7 and 8.

Here the Cobalt Strike C2 Config extracted using this tool is as shown below.
