DarkOwl analysts regularly follow “darknet threat actors” that openly discuss cyberattacks
and disseminate stolen critical corporate and personal data. Such analysis helps DarkOwl’s
collection team direct crawlers and technical resources to potentially actionable and high-
value content for the Vision platform and its clients.

SiegedSec: A New Cyber Threat Actor Group
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent, first-ever global cyberwar, several
new offensive cyber cells have surfaced. Many of the groups have a strictly hacktivist
mission – knocking commercial and government organizations across Russia offline – while
other groups piggyback on the collective energy of widespread offensive cyber operations to
successfully fulfill more sinister cybercriminal or purely selfish objectives for personal gain.

One new cyber cell, appearing coincidently days before the invasion, has named its
operation under the SiegedSec and adopted variations of the tagline, “sieging their victim’s
security.”  The group, led by a renowned hacktivist using the moniker YourAnonWolf, has
quickly progressed in lethality by increasing the group’s volume of victims announced in
recent months.

Defaced and Leaked Data
Quick takeaways:

Since their formation in late February 2022, DarkOwl analysts have observed
SiegedSec provide proof of the defacement and/or compromise of at least 11 websites
with rather juvenile and crude language and graphics included in the defacements.

In April, the group claimed they had successfully defaced over 100+ domains offering
proof of a hosting chat dialogue indicating the account passwords had been changed
and the defacements corrected, but the group hinted they still had access to the
domains.
DarkOwl analysts also discovered several thousand compromised LinkedIn profiles
with references to SiegedSec. 

There is evidence that the group has gained access to sensitive information and leaked
emails or leaked databases from at least 30 different companies since their start in
February. However, hardly any of the companies announced have released public noticed of
cybersecurity incidents since many are smaller businesses or located in non-English
speaking parts of the world. The group shows no preference for the industries nor locations
of its victims. They have successfully targeted companies across numerous diverse industry
sectors around the globe including healthcare, information technology, insurance, legal, and
finance. We’ve witnessed victims announced from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, South Africa,
USA, Philippines, Costa Rica, Mexico, and others.

In early April, the group’s spokesperson, YourAnonWolf, appeared on the popular discussion
forum, Breached Forums leaking databases, documents, emails containing 17 different
organizations’ data including usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords.

The extent of damage caused by cyberattacks conducted by SiegedSec is unknown and
many of them have not been mentioned by public news media sources. However, the leaked
data shared on their Telegram channel and on deep web forums like Breached could easily
be employed by other threat actors to gain access to companies, individuals, and networks
by leveraging the private corporate and personal information posted.

Intentions, Motivations, and Shenanigans
As we mentioned earlier, the defacements observed by the group appear to include vulgar
language with references to “d*cks and c*mdogs.” The group’s Telegram channel and social
media accounts include posts from the members that self-identify as “gay furries” with
downright comical slogans like “TEH LULZ CONTINUES!”, “uwu gay furries pwn you”, and
“HACK THE PLANET.” Their avatar includes the letters “$ UWU” – imitating a Linux terminal
prompt; the “uwu” letters denotes “overwhelmed with cuteness” and is common in the online
furry subculture, which anthropomorphize animals with human personalities.

The group has leaked a significant volume of stolen data from compromised networks, but
there is no indication the group uses ransomware nor has attempted to sell the stolen data.
According to the themes of their social media posts, and the “furry-centric” brand they’ve
embodied, the group appears to be motivated by the sheer fun of the experience, the
potential clout gained by publicly mocking organizations with insufficient information security
controls.

In late May, the group announced they had successfully targeted an India-based online news
distribution outlet, called NewsVoir. Shortly after the attack they leaked an archive containing
27GB of documents exfiltrated from the organization’s servers, and another archive of
hundreds of gigabytes in size consisting of source code and API data on the servers. Last
week, the group claimed on their Telegram channel the media outlet’s website provider,
WebGuruz contacted them directly and the group leaked a screenshot reportedly from their
chat directly with a WebGuruz representative. In the chat transcript, “Wolf” (YourAnonWolf)
intimates their efforts are not all simply fun, games, and ‘lulz’, but they are possibly interested
in financial compensation for their campaigns.

SiegedSec Members & Connections with Other “Hacker” Groups
SiegedSec’s Telegram group has limited membership and activity. We discovered a Keybase
“team account” that claims the group has 7 active members.

YourAnonWolf – a self-declared “corn god and furry” – is the most prominent and vocal
member of the group with the longest darknet history of its public members. Another possible
member of SiegedSec is cialulz who describes themselves as a “15-year-old, Security
Researcher & Privacy Advocate. Just an anthropomorphic frog with a thing for computers”
and openly uses the #SiegedSec hashtag in their social media profiles. Cialulz is also named
as affiliated with other cyber cells in historical deep web documents in Vision, including the
“OSAMA SEC MEMBERS LIST” from 2021 and mentioned in official rosters for GoonSquad
(a.k.a. #WeAreTheGoons) which apparently was quite active carrying out campaigns in
2017. (Source: DarkOwl Vision)

Another moniker mentioned in coordination with SiegedSec is “Sryakarad“, often shortened
to “Sry” in darknet chatter. Sryakarad was mentioned specifically as a key contributor to
SiegedSec when the group leaked data from another online media firm they compromised in
Pakistan, e-paper.pakistan.

In addition to YourAnonWolf, cialuluz, and Sry, other SiegedSec members possibly include
echowo (EchoNull7), mkht1, Trav (trav0x90), and webvuln (r00tsauce), although there are
preliminary indications that some of these aliases might be alternative accounts for

YourAnonWolf or cialulz.

The group also appears to have close associations with GhostSec, a prominent hacking
group with an extensive darknet history who has become increasingly popular for their
attacks against Russia in the cyberwar. Social media accounts affiliated with SiegedSec and
its members often re-share announcements of attacks conducted by GhostSec. DarkOwl
also noted overlap in the membership of the groups’ Telegram channels.

On Breached Forums, YourAnonWolf publicly declared that they are a member of both
GhostSec and SiegedSec. YourAnonWolf has been historically active conducting campaigns
with Anonymous and GhostSec targeting unjust governments and countries known for
human rights abuses. They also claim to have been previously affiliated with other groups
including: HackersGhost25, AxoSec and BreachSec. The status of these other cyber cells is
unclear.

A document shared on Pastebin in early June confirmed the aliases of the possible members
identified above, but also criticizes the technical prowess of the group, claiming most of their
attacks are basic SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The paste compared
SiegedSec to Lulzsec, a high-profiled cyber threat group in the early 2010s who similarly
initially claimed to have conducted their attacks simply for the “lulz” or laughs, and often
mocked their victims for the security flaws they uncovered.  The Lulzsec group was
comprised of four-young British hackers who infamously successfully targeted the CIA, PBS,
Westboro Baptist Church, and Sony gaining significant digital notoriety and infamy.

The group’s members, ranging in age between 18 and 26 years old, were all sentenced in
2013 between 20 and 32 months for violation of the UK’s computer misuse act in conjunction
with the cyber campaigns they conducted. Some of its members were banned from the
Internet for upwards of two years and spent time in the Young Offender’s Institute to be
reformed.

An anonymous response to the paste was uploaded to Pastebin a few days later addressing
each of the statements directly, especially those which minimized the skills of the group’s
members. In response to criticism for using automated scanners, the author stated
automated tools have a purpose and not only “skids” use them, even though the original post
did not publicly call SiedgedSec “skids.” The response paste was signed –Unknown (Source:

Final Thought From Our Analysts
Although they are presently a fairly small-scale operation flying under the radar with little to
no reporting by the greater global information security community, the data discovered during
our analysis and contained in the leaks from their victims indicate that there are advanced
cyber hacktivists involved in the group’s operations.

6/7



The similarities between Lulzsec, LAPSUS$, and the new group, SiegedSec are noteworthy
– as SiegedSec’s leader, YourAnonWolf uses similar popular hacking culture phrases that
LulzSec’s member, Topiary used. History, regardless of real life or virtual events, tends to
repeat itself.

DarkOwl assesses that SiegedSec has the potential to evolve into a high-consequential
cyber threat, especially if the group starts demanding extortion payments in conjunction with
their attacks.
