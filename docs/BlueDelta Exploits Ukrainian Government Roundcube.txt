Recorded Future's Insikt Group, in partnership with Ukraine's Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA), has uncovered a campaign targeting
high-profile entities in Ukraine that was cross-correlated with a spearphishing
campaign uncovered by Recorded Future’s Network Traffic Intelligence. The
campaign leveraged news about Russia’s war against Ukraine to encourage
recipients to open emails, which immediately compromised vulnerable
Roundcube servers (an open-source webmail software), using CVE-2020-
35730, without engaging with the attachment. We found that the campaign
overlaps with historic BlueDelta activity exploiting the Microsoft Outlook zero-
day vulnerability CVE-2023-23397 in 2022.

The BlueDelta activity, identified by Insikt Group, appears to have been
operational since November 2021. The campaign overlaps with activity
attributed by CERT-UA to APT28 (also known as Forest Blizzard and Fancy
Bear), which multiple Western governments attribute to the Main Directorate of
the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU). In this
operation, BlueDelta primarily targeted Ukrainian organizations, including
government institutions and military entities involved in aircraft infrastructure.

The BlueDelta campaign used spearphishing techniques, sending emails with
attachments exploiting vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2020-12641, and
CVE-2021-44026) in Roundcube to run reconnaissance and exfiltration scripts,
redirecting incoming emails and gathering session cookies, user information,
and address books. The attachment contained JavaScript code that executed
additional JavaScript payloads from BlueDelta-controlled infrastructure. The
campaign displayed a high level of preparedness, quickly weaponizing news

content into lures to exploit recipients. The spearphishing emails contained
news themes related to Ukraine, with subject lines and content mirroring
legitimate media sources.

BlueDelta has demonstrated a long-standing interest in gathering intelligence
on entities in Ukraine and across Europe, primarily among government and
military/defense organizations. The most recent activity very likely represents a
continued focus on these entities and specifically those within Ukraine. We
assess that BlueDelta activity is likely intended to enable military intelligence-
gathering to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and believe that BlueDelta
will almost certainly continue to prioritize targeting Ukrainian government and
private sector organizations to support wider Russian military efforts.

Recorded Future’s collaboration with CERT-UA further emphasizes the
importance of partnerships between industry and governments to enable
collective defense against strategic threats — in this case, Russia’s war against
Ukraine.
