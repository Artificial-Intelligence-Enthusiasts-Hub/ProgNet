About IRSEM
The Institute for Strategic Research (IRSEM), founded in 2009, is a research institute attached to the French 
Ministry for the Armed Forces (formerly the Ministry of Defense). With a team of about 50 civilian and military em-
ployees, a majority of which had been trained at the doctoral level, it is the primary War Studies center in the Fran-
cophone world. Along with conducting internal research for the Ministry for the Armed Forces and external research 
aimed at the scientific community on questions of defense and security, IRSEM supports young researchers and 
contributes to higher military education and to the public debate.
IRSEM produces independent analyses that do not constitute official positions. The views expressed in this 
report are therefore those of its authors and in no way that of IRSEM, the Ministry for the Armed Forces, or the 
French government.

FOREWORD

The influence strategies and operations presented in this report have been implemented 
by the Chinese regime, not by China or the Chinese. Just as we recommended in the 2018 
CAPS-IRSEM report to prefer “the Kremlin” to “Russia,” to avoid conflating the govern-
ment and the people,1 we will therefore preferably use “the Party-State” or “Beijing” rather 
than “China.” “The Party-State” designates the regime as a whole (with its three corner-
stones: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the state, and the People’s Liberation Army 
(PLA)). Any occurrence of  “China,” therein used for convenience, refers to the regime and 
not to the Chinese society or to the Chinese people.

This vocabulary precaution has become necessary because both those who dare criticize 
the CCP’s practices are immediately accused by the Chinese authorities, state media, and 
social media trolls of  being “anti-China” (“反华”2) “anti-Chinese,” “racist,” “xenophobic,” 
or “Sinophobe” – exactly as the Kremlin brands its detractors as “Russophobes.” All are 
“labels that polarize and kill productive conversation.”3 We anticipate being the targets of  
such attacks, and we make clear straightaway that, in either case, what is questioned is nei-
ther a population, nor a country, but rather the practices of  an authoritarian government. It 
is possible to criticize one without denigrating the other. In conflating the two, the regime 
claims to speak for the “Chinese people” which, whether in China or abroad (albeit with 
different means), is often the first to criticize CCP practices. 

From this perspective, those who deny the reality or impact of  the influence operations 
described in this volume and those who, on the opposite end of  the spectrum, describe “China” 
as an “enemy” or speak about a “clash of  civilizations” should be rejected. In fact, both are 
playing into Beijing’s hands: an overtly hostile attitude conflating the government and the people 
feeds an anti-Chinese sentiment that certainly lingers in certain areas (generally places with large 
diasporic communities) and at certain times (during the Covid-19 pandemic, for instance). This 
allows the Party-State to kill two birds with one stone: it presents itself  as the savior and protec-
tor of  the Chinese living abroad, thus extending its influence over them, and it denounces any 
criticism of  the regime as being “anti-Chinese” and therefore “racist.”

2. The China Media Project found 79 occurrences of  the term “anti-China” in the People’s Daily in 2020, a sharp 
increase compared to the 2010s (between 10 and 30 yearly). The frequent use of  this term highlights the tensions inside 
the regime and the heightened perception of  risks among the Party’s leaders. 2008 was the last time a similar number 
was found (82). That said, and despite the sudden rise, we remain far from the levels reached during important periods 
of  tensions, such as under Jiang Zemin after the bombing of  the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, following the 
EP-3E incident in 2001 (more than 100 occurrences), or during the Sino-Indian War of  1962-1963 (more than 200).

This explains this preliminary vocabulary clarification: the problem is not “China,” it 
is not an “enemy” (the Party is actually the one dividing the world into “friends” – those 
who support its interests – and “enemies” – those who dare criticize it4) and there is no 
“clash of  civilizations.” The problem is not a philosophical difference between two equally 
valid options, a supposedly “Confucian” China or the international “liberal” order. The 
problem, according to historian Frank Dikötter, is that the “CCP remains, structurally, a 
Leninist one-party state [that tries to undermine] anything and everything opposed to it 
at home and abroad.”5 What we are confronted with, in the words of  Clive Hamilton and 
Mareike Ohlberg, is not “some Confucian ‘other,’ but an authoritarian regime, a Leninist 
political party replete with a central committee, a politburo and a general secretary backed 
by enormous economic, technological and military resources. The real clash is between the 
CCP’s repressive values and practices, and the freedoms enshrined in the UN’s Universal 
Declaration of  Human Rights: the freedom of  speech, assembly, religion and belief; free-
dom from persecution; the right to personal privacy; and equal protection under the law. 
The CCP rejects each of  these, in words or in deeds.”6

Finally, it is important to specify that this report was not commissioned by the Ministry 
or the government, but that it was initiated by the authors. Only a minority of  IRSEM’s 
work is produced in response to orders from the Ministry of  the Armed Forces. For the 
rest, the Institute freely chooses its subjects. In this case, it was the authors who, in 2019, in 
the wake of  the publication of  the CAPS-IRSEM report on Information Manipulation (2018), 
decided to work on the Chinese case specifically, only to quickly discover that they needed 
to broaden the focus from the informational field to that of  influence as a whole. The study 
of  influence strategies has been one of  IRSEM’s research axes since 2017. The present 
work is therefore part of  a series of  publications (→ p. 650).

PRELIMINARY NOTE 

In this report, all Chinese terms (i.e. from mainland China) are transliterated according 
to the rules of  Hanyu Pinyin, except for several words which are used in common parlance 
and could be potentially incomprehensible with this method of  transliteration. For exam-
ple, the French text uses Canton for Guangzhou, Pékin for Beijing and Nankin for Nanjing. 
On the other hand, we have used the Hanyu Pinyin transcription for Mao Zedong instead 
of  Mao Tse-tung, which we consider outdated. For Taiwanese terms and proper nouns the 
situation is more complex. Taiwan has long used the Anglophone transliteration system 
known as Wade-Giles. In 2002, the Republic of  China developed an indigenous translit-
eration system, Tongyong Pinyin, which was not widely adopted, certain cities opting for 
the continental Pinyin and most media continuing to use Wade-Giles. We therefore tried to 
comply with the most common uses. Finally, Hong Kong names are written according to 
the Romanization rules for Cantonese adopted by the Hong Kong government.

Works are cited first in the original language and then, in parentheses, in English. Unless 
stated otherwise, English translations are our own. In general, we have translated into 
English all the names of  Chinese institutions, except if  an official English translation exists 
or when an institution is known by its English name.

The departments of  the CCP Central Committee are sometimes named “Central 
Departments” (Organization, Propaganda, United Front Work, and International Affairs). 
In this report, an affiliation with the Central Committee is implicit: we did not specify that 
they are “central” departments at every occurrence.

When writing without additional precision, “dollar” refers to the American dollar. Sums 
in American dollars are generally not converted in euros, but all other currencies are.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

For a long time, it could be said that China, unlike Russia, sought to be loved rather than to 
be feared; that it wanted to seduce, project a positive image of  itself  in the world, and arouse ad-
miration. Today, Beijing has not given up on seduction, on its attractiveness, and on its ambition 
to shape international norms. Not “losing face” remains very important for the CCP. And yet, 
Beijing is also increasingly comfortable with infiltration and coercion: its influence operations 
have been considerably hardened in recent years and its methods increasingly resemble Mos-
cow’s. The Party-State has entered a “Machiavellian moment” in the sense that Beijing now 
appears to believe that, as Machiavelli wrote in The Prince, “it is better to be feared than loved.” 
This evolution shows a “Russification” of  Chinese influence operations. And our report 
analyzes this evolution, with the ambition of  covering the entire spectrum of  its tools of  influ-
ence, from the most benign (public diplomacy) to the most malign – which means interfering 
in other countries’ affairs (clandestine activities). To do so, our analysis proceeds in four parts, 
successively presenting the concepts, actors, actions pertaining to this moment, and it ends with 
several case studies.

1. The concepts that are important to understand Chinese influence operations include the 
“United Front” – a CCP policy that consists in eliminating internal and external enemies, con-
trolling groups that could defy its authority, constructing a coalition around the Party to serve 
its interests, and projecting its influence abroad – and the “Three warfares,” which represent 
the core of  China’s “political warfare,” i.e. a form of  non-kinetic proneness to conflict aimed at 
overcoming an opponent without a fight through the creation of  an environment favorable to 
China. A wartime and peacetime undertaking, it encompasses public opinion, psychological, and 
legal warfare (the latter being close to what is called “lawfare” in English). 

A Soviet concept is also useful to describe Beijing’s repertoire: “active measures,” which 
includes disinformation, counterfeiting, sabotage, discredit operations, destabilizing foreign gov-
ernments, provocations, false-flag operations and manipulation aimed at weakening social cohe-
sion, the recruitment of  “useful idiots,” and the creation of  front organizations.

2. The main actors implementing Chinese influence operations are emanations from the 
Party, the State, the Army, and the companies. Within the Party, this includes the Propaganda 
Department, which oversees ideology, controls the entire media spectrum and all the cultural 
production in the country; the United Front Work Department (UFWD), with its twelve of-
fices reflecting its main targets; the International Liaison Department (ILD), which maintains 
relations with foreign political parties; the 610 Office, which has agents across the world acting 
outside any legal framework to eliminate the Falun Gong movement. The Chinese Communist 
Youth League (CYL) should also be included in this group, serving at once as a link toward 
young people, as an incubator for future Party executives, and as a force that can be mobilized 
when needed – even if  it is not a formal structure of  the Party but rather a mass organization.

15



Within the state, two bodies in particular are involved in influence operations: The Ministry 
of  State Security (MSS), which is the main civilian intelligence agency, and the Taiwan Affairs 
Office (TAO), in charge of  the propaganda aimed at Taiwan. 

Within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the Strategic Support Force (SSF) is at the 
forefront, especially through its Network Systems Department. It has the resources and is en-
trusted with missions in the informational domain. More precisely, the principal actor identified 
in this domain is Base 311, headquartered in Fuzhou, which is dedicated to the implementation 
of  the “Three Warfares” strategy. It also operates media companies as civilian covers and a fake 
hotel to hide a training center. 

Finally, public and private companies play an important role in collecting the data needed 
to decide who should be targeted by influence operations, when, and how. Infrastructures are 
particularly useful in data collection – buildings and submarine cables for instance – as are new 
technologies: digital platforms such as WeChat, Weibo and TikTok, companies like Beidou and 
Huawei, and databases that provide insight into what researchers call China’s “techno-author-
itarianism” or “digital authoritarianism” are all used to prepare and feed influence operations 
abroad. The Joint Staff  Department of  the Central Military Commission, which has apparently 
inherited intelligence missions previously entrusted to the former 2APL, should also be included 
in this list. However, due to insufficient sources, this institution is not covered in the report.

3. The actions carried out by Beijing in its influence operations abroad pertain to two main 
and non-mutually exclusive objectives: first, to seduce and captivate foreign audiences by 
crafting a positive representation of  China, which can be illustrated by four specific narratives 
(the Chinese “model,” its tradition, benevolence, and strength); and then, and above all, to 
infiltrate and coerce. Infiltration aims at slowly penetrating the opposing societies to hamper 
the very possibility of  an action contrary to the Party’s interests. Coercion corresponds to the 
progressive enlargement of  the Chinese “punitive” or “coercive” diplomacy toward a policy of  
systematic sanctions against any state, organization, company, or individual that threatens the 
Party’s interests. Both are generally carried out via a web of  intermediaries. Overall, these prac-
tices target the following categories:

- Diasporas, with the dual objective of  controlling them – so that they do not represent a 
threat for the Chinese power (Beijing carries out a transnational campaign of  repression which, 
according to the NGO Freedom House, is the “most sophisticated, global, and complete in the 
world”) – and mobilizing them to serve its interests.

- The media, as Beijing’s explicit goal is to establish “a new world media order.” Indeed, the 
government has invested €1.3 billion annually since 2008 to impose a tighter control over its 
global image. The major Chinese media outlets have a global presence, in several languages, on 
several continents, and on all social networks, including those blocked in China (Twitter, Face-
book, YouTube, and Instagram), and they invest large amounts of  money to augment their dig-
ital audience artificially. Beijing also seeks to control the Chinese-language outlets abroad, which 
has proven so successful that the CCP now effectively enjoys a near-monopoly among them, and 
it also seeks to control the mainstream media. Finally, the Party-State is interested in controlling 
the containers, exerting its influence over each step along the global information supply chain, 
targeting televisions, digital platforms, and smartphones.

- Diplomacy, with a focus on two aspects. First, influence over international organizations 
and norms: Beijing deploys classic diplomatic resources along with clandestine influence oper-
ations (economic and political pressure, cooptation, coercion, and corruption) to strengthen its 
influence. Second, the so-called “wolf-warrior” diplomacy: it refers to more aggressive postures 
adopted by the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs’ spokespersons and a dozen diplomats. These attacks 
take both classic and relatively new forms, notably relying on the use of  social networks and 
on an uninhibited recourse to invective, admonition, even intimidation. Overall, this aggressive 
turn of  the Chinese diplomacy has proven counter-productive and it has largely contributed to 

16



the abrupt deterioration of  China’s global image in recent years. This evolution is probably sus-
tainable for the actors involved, as the objective is less to conquer the hearts and minds than to 
please Beijing.

- The economy: an economic dependence is often the first lever China uses. Economic coer-
cion then takes very different forms: a ban from the Chinese domestic market, embargos, trade 
sanctions and restrictions on domestic investment, quotas imposed on regions highly dependent 
on Chinese tourists, or mass boycotts. Besides, Beijing increasingly imposes censorship as a pre-
requisite to access its domestic market; many companies end up bowing under pressure. 

- Politics, with the goal of  penetrating target countries to influence public policymaking 
mechanisms. Maintaining direct relationships with political parties and influential political figures 
allows the Party-State to infiltrate the target countries, to gather official and unofficial support 
there, and to circumvent eventual blockages within the governments by using opposition or “re-
tired” public figures. Beijing also interferes with elections (over the last decade, China may have 
interfered in at least 10 elections in 7 countries). 

- Education, via universities first and foremost, which are one of  the main targets of  the 
Party’s influence efforts. Its principal levers are: financial dependence, leading to self-censorship 
in the universities; surveillance and intimidation of  Chinese students, university instructors and 
administrators on foreign campuses; imposed modifications in course content, teaching mate-
rials, or programmed events; and shaping Chinese Studies, by encouraging self-censorship and 
punishing critical researchers. The Party-State also uses universities to acquire knowledge and 
technology, via legal and overt means, such as joint research programs, or illegal and covert 
actions, like theft and espionage. In a context of  civil-military fusion, certain joint programs or 
researchers holding positions in dozens of  Western universities involuntarily aid Beijing build 
weapons of  mass destruction or surveillance technologies which are used to oppress the Chinese 
population. On this topic, several scandals broke out in public in 2020 and 2021. 

Finally, there is another important actor of  Chinese influence in education tied to the univer-
sities: the Confucius Institutes and Classrooms that have opened all around the world and which, 
under the guise of  teaching Chinese language and culture, have heightened the dependency, or 
subjection, of  certain universities to China, damaged academic freedom. They may have occa-
sionally been used for espionage.

- Think tanks: the Chinese strategy in this domain is two-pronged. Beijing seeks to establish 
overseas branches of  Chinese think tanks, and to take advantage of  local relays that may them-
selves be think tanks, with three possible scenarios: occasional partners acting as amplifiers on 
local markets of  ideas, circumstantial allies that spread the Party’s narratives, and accomplices 
that share a common worldview and convergent interests with the CCP.

- Culture: first via the production and export of  cultural products, such as films, TV series, 
music, and books – all powerful tools of  seduction. Influence can also be exerted on foreign 
cultural productions, especially filmmakers, with the example of  Hollywood: to avoid upset-
ting Beijing and hence maintain an access to the enormous Chinese domestic market, many 
American movie studios censor themselves, cutting or modifying movie scenes. Some are even 
overzealous, casting Chinese characters for the “good” roles. Being denied access to the Chinese 
market is almost certain for any artist who criticizes the Party-State. Via other types of  pressure, 
Beijing also hopes to encourage artists to modify their work or, for those exhibiting elsewhere in 
the world, to simply stop, or even to do the work of  Chinese censors.

- Information manipulation, resorting to fake accounts on social networks to spread the 
Party’s propaganda in the media, trolls and astroturfing (to simulate spontaneous popular move-
ments), and to numerous “internet commentators” (falsely labeled the “50 cent army”) that 
are paid to “guide” public opinion. Generally controlled by the PLA or the CYL, trolls defend, 
attack, stir controversy, insult, or harass their targets. Another way to simulate authenticity is to 
have content published by third parties in exchange for money (content farms, purchase of  mes-
sages, of  influence over an account, of  an account or a page, or recruitment of  “influencers”). 

17



Since 2019, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube no longer refrain from identifying coordinated 
campaigns originating in China. Hence, tens of  thousands of  fake accounts have been suspend-
ed: some had long been “dormant,” others had been bought or stolen, most of  them amplifying 
Chinese propaganda and attacking the United States (in Chinese and in English). Some accounts 
have profile pictures generated by artificial intelligence – a now regularly-observed practice in 
Chinese operations on social networks. Additionally, an important aspect of  these campaigns is 
that they do not simply defend China: the promotion of  the Chinese model goes hand in hand 
with the debasement of  other models, especially liberal democracies, as Russian influence oper-
ations have done for years. The PLA is at the heart of  these maneuvers, using social networks 
to conduct “open” influence operations and circulating propaganda on the one hand, often aim-
ing at deterrence and psychological warfare; and to conduct clandestine and hostile operations 
against foreign targets on the other hand. 

- Other levers: Beijing also uses citizen movements in its influence operations – especially 
separatist (New Caledonia, Okinawa) and pacifist groups (No Cold War) – Chinese tourists, 
influencers (including Western YouTubers), and foreign academics, as well as hostages, since 
Beijing has deployed a “hostage diplomacy.”

4. The case studies are introduced in concentric circles. Taiwan and Hong Kong constitute 
the first front in Beijing’s “political warfare”: they are outposts, training grounds, “R&D labs” for 
Chinese operations which are subsequently refined and applied to other targets worldwide – not 
unlike what Georgia and Ukraine meant for Russian operations. A first widening of  the circle of  
Chinese operations targeted Australia and New Zealand. A second step was to aim for the rest 
of  the world, particularly – but not exclusively – Europe and North America. This part intro-
duces four cases – Taiwan, Singapore, Sweden, and Canada – and two operations, which targeted 
Hong Kong protestors in 2019 and framed the Covid-19 as an American creation in 2020.

Finally, the conclusion comes back to this notion of  a “Machiavellian moment” in two steps. 
First, to confirm that there has indeed been a “Russification” of  Chinese influence operations 
since about 2017: the parallel had already been made in 2018 during the Taiwanese municipal 
elections, and later during the 2019 Hong Kong crisis; but the world only became aware of  the 
problem in 2020 with the Covid-19 pandemic. The three components of  this Russification are 
then laid out: Beijing draws inspiration from Moscow on several levels (the existing Chinese 
military literature acknowledges that, for the PLA, Russia is a model to emulate on such opera-
tions). Yet, differences obviously remain between the two, and there is also a certain degree of  
cooperation.

Last but not least, the conclusion seeks to assess the effectiveness of  this new Chinese pos-
ture and concludes that, if  it brought certain tactical successes, it has been a strategic failure over-
all, China being its own worst enemy in terms of  influence. The abrupt degradation of  Beijing’s 
reputation since the arrival of  Xi Jinping, particularly in the last couple of  years, confronts China 
with a growing unpopularity problem that may indirectly come to weaken the Party, including 
vis-à-vis its own population.

INTRODUCTION 

For a long time, the best China watchers, particularly those based in the outposts that 
are Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as the intelligence services of  a certain number of  
Western countries, have warned of  the CCP’s hegemonic and revisionist ambitions.1 
Their warnings were not taken seriously by most decision-makers, who held a naïve belief  
in the Chinese “peaceful rise” theory and were overconfident about the superiority of  the 
democratic model. As the CCP opened itself  to the world, and with its greater economic 
integration, people thought it would “normalize” itself, i.e. liberalize itself  politically. Those 
who did not believe in this evolution were generally too consumed by the Russian threat or 
terrorism to pay attention to China. 

Therefore, taking advantage of  the spirit of  engagement that emanated from the rest of  
the world, the CCP was able to consolidate its global influence, in almost total peace 
and quiet, by investing widely and massively, creating economic dependencies, developing 
trade partnerships as well as cultural relations, in each country via an extraordinarily dense 
network of  local Chinese associations and stakes in a growing number of  international 
organizations, media outlets, and so on. Today, faced with the depth and density of  this 
network across all regions and sectors, many have come to understand that globalization 
has not liberalized the Chinese regime: it has impressively developed the Chinese 
economy and its power incidentally, without weakening the Party. As one of  us wrote 
elsewhere, “the notion according to which China would soften with the development of  
economic exchange was an illusion. It has in fact become more aggressive.”2

First came a phase of  increased self-confidence or assertiveness following the 
2008 economic crisis, from which Beijing profited to consolidate its power. A second 
followed with the rise to power of  Xi Jinping in 2012. With him, the CCP’s control over 
the Chinese society has considerably increased in all its dimensions, putting an end to the 
subtle efforts at manufacturing consent put in place under Jiang Zemin and, especially, Hu 
Jintao. On the international scene, Xi has also reinforced the Party’s historic tendency to see 
its interlocutors through the dichotomous division between “friends” (those who support 
the Party’s interests) and “enemies” (those who are the least bit critical).3 Additionally, he 
went on with an accelerated militarization of  the country and adopted a more aggressive 
posture.4 Finally, since the adoption of  the 2017 national intelligence law, both citizens and 
Chinese public companies have been required to cooperate with Chinese intelligence ser-

vices. This obligation further blurs the line between public and private spaces in the life of  
overseas citizens and companies. Any citizen or company can be forced to become a CCP 
agent, in other words at the very least an informer and sometimes a spy.

Since 2017, approximately, we have witnessed a third phase that has accelerated 
with the 2019 Hong Kong crisis and the 2020 pandemic. Andrew Small and Shruva 
Jaishankar list four possible theories to explain this last transformation:5 (1) the opportu-
nistic assertiveness theory (Beijing takes advantage of  political and economic problems in 
the rest of  the world, and in the West in particular, to advance its interests – in this respect 
Beijing is convinced that democracies will inevitably decay, that this process has already 
begun and accelerated with the pandemic: the Party-State is thus encouraged to seize this 
opportune moment [kairos]) – this is also the thesis brilliantly supported by Rush Doshi6: 
China would face a period of  strategic opportunity revealed by the internal difficulties 
of  the West (Brexit, the election of  Donald Trump, or the West’s inability to manage the 
health crisis in particular); (2) the imperious assertiveness or hybris theory (“China’s leaders 
have internalized their own success to an inordinate degree. They genuinely believe that 
China now offers a viable alternative to the United States as a global power and that any 
criticism is unjustified or hypocritical.”7 Rivalry is accepted and taken on. This excessive 
confidence is at once unfounded, as China has numerous weaknesses, and dangerous, as it 
could further encourage an aggressive posture); (3) the “reactive assertiveness”8 theory (the 
Chinese behavior is here explained as an “escalatory response to the immediate economic, 
reputational, security, and political challenges China faces through the pandemic and its 
aftermath”9); and (4) the insecure assertiveness theory (the Chinese behavior would then 
be explained by the leadership’s fear that China is entering “an extended period of  vulner-
ability:” Beijing’s actions thus reveal not “a sense of  strength, but of  weakness.”10) These 
theories are not mutually exclusive, and a combination of  explanations is possible and even 
probable. This is why Peter Martin is right to speak of  the “mixture of  self-declared confi-
dence and jumpy insecurity manifested by the current leadership” of  the Party-State.11

Whatever the right explanation(s) may be, Beijing has demonstrated a growing 
aggressiveness in recent years, first in its regional environment (Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
India, Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines and to a lesser extent Malaysia and Japan), but 
also in the rest of  the world (North America and Europe first and foremost). This behavior, 
which breaks with the “non-intervention” tradition of  the Chinese foreign policy, is some-
times called “sharp power.” While “soft power” is “the ability to affect others by attrac-
tion and persuasion,” according to Joseph Nye’s definition,12 “sharp power” is the use of  
“subversion, bullying, and pressure, which combine to promote self-censorship.”13 
The term is not new but was popularized by a report from the National Endowment for 
Democracy (NED) which, in December 2017, applied it to the Chinese and Russian pos-
tures. “Sharp power,” as explained by its authors, does not seek to attract (unlike soft power)

but to “pierce, penetrate, or perforate the information and political environments in the tar-
geted countries.”14 The term is fashionable but debatable (is sharp power ultimately nothing 
more than “a type of  hard power,” as Joseph Nye believes?).15 Like J. Michael Cole there-
fore, we prefer to speak of  “political warfare” or “influence operations.”16

The goal of  these operations is, on one hand, to prevent any negative discussion of  
the CCP, by anticipating and controlling all the narratives on the “five poisons” (Uyghurs, 
Tibetans, Falun Gong, “pro-democracy activists,” “Taiwanese separatists”) and any criti-
cism of  the Party generally; on the other hand, they mean to generate a positive narra-
tive about the prosperity, strength, and peaceful rise of  China. This is directed at several 
targets: first at overseas Chinese citizens (students, researchers, businessmen, etc.) who 
will return home or travel back and forth, thus potentially importing corrupting (demo-
cratic and liberal) ideas into China; then, at those presented as forming a Chinese overseas 
“community,” “sons and daughters of  China,” who are foreigners of  Chinese ancestry in 
the broadest sense, whatever their current citizenship or the number of  generations since 
their closest ancestor born in China (ethno-nationalism); finally, at the rest of  the world, i.e. 
national public opinions, primarily in the countries that matter for Beijing, and for various 
reasons. In any case, outward influence has first and foremost domestic motivations: the 
CCP’s top priority is to stay in power and perpetuate the regime. But this cannot ipso facto 
mean that China does not, at the same time, have global ambitions or a grand strategy, as a 
careful study of  the Party’s output reveals (→ p. 148).17

The question of  Chinese influence, in the world in general or in a country in particular, has 
in recent years sparked an exponential number of  publications, an overview of  which can 
be found in the more than 3,000 footnotes in the present volume. The “literature” on Chinese 
influence covers the whole spectrum of  publications, from scientific articles and press articles 
to books and (numerous) reports from think tanks and research centers of  which several, like 
the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in Canberra, have developed a real expertise 
and a regular production on the subject in recent years.18 Despite this extraordinary abun-
dance, the greater part of  which is written in English and focuses on several cases – such as 
Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States and Canada – our knowledge of  these 
complex operations, carried out by an intricate web of  actors, remains fragmented. 
Like Antoine Bondaz, we feel that “a better understanding of  the mechanisms of  the Chinese 
influence abroad, and more specifically in Europe and France, is crucial.”19

In analyzing these activities, the line between influence (which is legitimate) and 
interference (which is illegitimate) is thin and blurred. “As with many things involving 
China, there is a continuum, running from what is acceptable to not acceptable,” noted 
David Mulroney, former Canadian ambassador to China.20 Thus, drawing red lines has been

one of  the major issues for states. Following former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm 
Turnbull, a red line could be drawn by “foreign influence activities that are in any way 
covert, coercive or corrupt.”21 This then includes deceptive conducts and activities that cor-
rupt “political processes, media markets, public debate and academic freedom, for example, 
by using improper inducements falling short of  criminal bribery.”22 Because any attempt at 
a definition is inevitably open to criticisms, a more pragmatic way to understand where the 
line between acceptable influence and unacceptable interference lies is, as Charles Parton 
suggested, approaching it in terms of  its reciprocity: would similar actions be tolerated by 
the CCP in China?23 Obviously, the comparison has its limits, as a liberal democracy does 
not behave the way an authoritarian regime does. Ultimately, it is up to each country to draw 
the boundaries of  acceptable behavior according to its interests and values.

Be that as it may, this report covers the entire influence spectrum, from benign influ-
ence (public diplomacy) to malign influence, that is, interference (“clandestine, coercive, 
and corrupt” activities”24). Preparing this report, we conducted numerous interviews during 
travels to Sri Lanka, India, and Pakistan (November 2018), Kenya (January 2019), Japan (March 
2019), Vietnam (April 2019), Canada and the United States (April-May 2019), Singapore (April, 
August, and November 2019), Taiwan (April 2019 and January 2020), South Korea (April and 
June 2019), Mongolia (June 2019), Australia (August 2019), the Czech Republic (November 
2019), Denmark (January-February 2020), Sweden (February 2020), Germany (March 2020) 
and the United Kingdom (March 2020). We also drew from the available scientific literature 
in several languages and used open source intelligence (OSINT) resources.

This report proceeds in four parts: concepts, actors, actions, and case studies. 
Without of  course claiming to be exhaustive, particularly for the actions and cases presented 
here (they ultimately only illustrate what Beijing is capable of), this report aims neverthe-
less to lay out a relatively comprehensive overview of  Chinese influence operations 
across the globe – avoiding as much as possible the problem of  biting off  more than one 
can chew. It thus goes in-depth on certain subjects, and a few investigations, notably those 
on the Base 311 (→ p. 89), the LJC’s influence operations (→ p. 74), the ecosystem of  
think tanks and publishers relaying the Party’s influence in France (→ p. 314), and on Larry 
Romanoff  (→ p. 603), are, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive, in any language. 

The reader might be surprised not to find in this volume a chapter dedicated to France, 
since the authors are French and the fourth part contains case studies on Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, Singapore, Sweden and Canada. France is not absent from the following pages, which 
contain many French examples, but we did not want to gather them in a separate chapter 
for several reasons. First, because we have tried, as far as possible, to adopt a “view from 
nowhere”25: we did not conceive this work as a French report aimed at a French audience, 
and therefore focused on the French case, but as a study of  Chinese influence operations – its 
concepts, its actors, its operating modes – throughout the world. Secondly, because it seems to 
us that France has not been a priority target of  Chinese influence until now, at least compared 
to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom or even 
Sweden, which are cases with certain specificities. Finally, because, for a long time, France

was seen as a “soft” target, on which it was sufficient to exert economic pressure to obtain 
the desire effects. It was therefore not necessary to mount clandestine and complex influence 
operations. For some years now, however, France has been putting up resistance: this is the 
“French awakening” described in the conclusion (→ p. 640). As the environment becomes 
less permissive for Beijing, one can therefore expect its operations to become more aggressive 
in the future. Hence the usefulness of  this report in the French context.

That said, our approach is descriptive, not normative: the goal of  this report is to 
describe, understand, and analyze Chinese influence operations as precisely as possible. Of  
course, there is, implicitly, a normative dimension, in the sense that this description contrib-
utes to a growing understanding of  the risks these practices pose to civil liberties, human 
rights, and national sovereignty worldwide.26 That being said, we do not address “what 
should be done”: this report contains no recommendations. It is left to others to draw 
the necessary political consequences, which are evidently not the same for everyone.

26. Normativity is everywhere because all approaches have “a point of  view, a perspective, even when they do not 
recognize it.” The question is to know to what extent it is assumed (Jean-Baptiste Jeangène Vilmer, Théories des relations 
internationales (Theories of  International Relations), Que sais-je ?, 2020, 15-16).

Resorting to influence operations is not new for the Chinese regime; scholars have high- P
lighted the existence of  a particularly active policy of  internal and external propaganda T
since the formation of  red bases at the end of  the 1920s.1 Chinese influence operations S

are partly inspired by the Soviet experience, and they draw on two major doctrinal 
sources: first, the United Front (统一战线), which originated with the Party itself  and 
feeds now its entire machinery of  power; and then, the “Three Warfares” doctrine (三
种战法), more recent and more restrictively used. The doctrine was devised by the People’s A
Liberation Army (PLA) but it has been used well beyond the military realm. Here, the C
PLA takes on its traditional role as the Party’s influence multiplier, for instance. Beyond T
these frameworks, the actors of  Chinese influence operations have created numerous con- O
cepts tied to their influence strategies, and the most important of  them are succinctly laid R

S
out in this first part. After briefly introducing the relevant concepts (United Front, Three 
Warfares, cognitive operations, discursive power, political warfare and active measures), 
we elaborate on the two principal theoretical sources of  Chinese influence operations, the 
United Front and the Three Warfares.

The reader may be surprised not to find in the following pages familiar references that 
are commonly used to describe the Chinese strategy. If  Chinese theorists sometimes call A

C
on classic authors, Sun Zi above all, they do so essentially to give credibility and a historical T
foundation to their work. But their debt to this heritage should be nuanced. This report I
also does not make use of  the famous book by the Chinese generals Qiao Liang and Wang O
Xiangsui, Unrestricted Warfare (1999),2 which is unrepresentative despite being frequently N

S
highlighted as an indispensable reference to understanding contemporary Chinese strategic 
thinking. As Peter Mattis noted, “[one] of  the first clues about whether someone is a cred-
ible analyst of  the PLA comes from their preferred source for Chinese military thinking 
and strategy. An analysis that places Unrestricted Warfare above (or perhaps does not even 
reference) The Science of  Military Strategy (the reference manual at the Academy of  Military 
Science)3 offers little insight into how the Chinese military came to develop a strategy to C
wage war and protect China’s national interests.”4 A

Likewise, the concept of  the “information warfare” or “informational warfare,” central S
to other strategic traditions, including in the United States (information warfare) and Russia E

(информационная война), are not used as such in this report since it takes broader conno-

C not only psychological warfare (→ p. 49) and political warfare (→ p. 33), but also, and 
T
I above all, electronic warfare, which undoubtedly constitutes its essential component. As

“carrying out electronic attacks on networks, high-intensity informational attacks, jamming

I. The United Front P
T
S

The term United Front commonly refers, first, to the alliance forged by the communists 
and the nationalists when they fought their common Japanese enemy during the Second 
World War. But the United Front is in fact limited neither to this coalition nor to those 
subsequently formed with non-communist forces to overthrow the government and bring 
about the revolution. In fact, the United Front has endured from the revolution to this day, A
and it now entails above all “mobilizing the Party’s friends to strike its enemies.”1 C

T
In other words, it is a matter of  shaping the forces outside of  the Party to ensure its O

durability. Originally formulated by Lenin in his essay “Left-Wing” Communism: An Infantile R
Disorder (1920), in which he criticized the communists who refused to take advantage of  S
the platform offered by the democratic life in parliamentary regimes in the name of  ideo-
logical purity, the United Front is one of  the “three magic weapons” (法 宝) theorized by 
Mao Zedong in 19382 – the other two being armed struggles and the construction of  the 
Party. These strategies are not the sole responsibility of  the United Front Work Department 
(UFWD) but are deployed throughout the entire Party apparatus, as all its arms are tasked A
with implementing this policy (→ p. 35). C

II. The “Three Warfares” N
S

The “Three Warfares” doctrine was formulated in 2003. It encompasses psychological 
warfare (心理战), public opinion warfare (舆论战), and legal warfare (法律战). These 
three dimensions – which respectively aim at influencing the adversary’s decisions, shaping 
its public opinion, and forging a normative environment favorable to China – should not 
be understood as a Chinese version of  the “hybrid warfare,” but as an extension of  the C
actions of  the Party. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which is the armed wing of  A
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) more than a national army, is primarily tasked with S
ensuring the longevity of  the regime by augmenting the CCP’s political power. The “Three E

Warfares” should be interpreted within this framework (→ p. 45).

C
T
I An article published in 2004 in the PLA Daily, the PLA’s English newspaper, defined 
O
N public opinion warfare (→ p. 48) as “the integrated use of  newspapers, radios, televisions, 

the Internet, and other news media” in a “planned and targeted manner to encourage the 
drive to fight in its own camp and to make the will to fight in the enemy’s collapse, driv-

C ing the international public opinion at the same time.”3 In 2011, the Chinese Dictionary of  
O Military Terminology explained that the notion consists in “creating a public opinion envi-
N
C ronment favorable to political initiative and military victory (through) the use of  diverse 
E media and informational resources to combat the enemy.”4 The Chinese generally translate 
P “public opinion warfare” (舆论 战) as the “war of  consensus.”
T The PLA also takes a great interest in methods shaping online public opinion. Two 
S

different terms are used to refer to the general idea of  public opinion, 舆情 (yuqing) 
and 舆论 (yulun), which we have translated as “public emotion” and “public opinion” 
respectively. According to Li Changzu (李昌祖), of  the Department of  Propaganda at 
Zhejiang University of  Technology, and to his colleague Xu Tianlei (许 天雷),5 the first 

A term refers to the subjective interpretation of  certain social realities while the second 
C stresses the socio-political attitudes generated by social interactions. Public emotion can 
T thus be individual whereas public opinion is the collective majority opinion; public emo-
O
R tion can be implicit in nature while public opinion is explicit; similarly, a public emotion 
S does not necessarily become the public opinion and the latter is not always based on 

public emotion; finally, control over public feelings is an important part of  the work to 
orientate public opinion. In this context, the PLA is interested in tactics that allow 
the manipulation of  opinions and emotions.

T
I According to the 2011 Dictionary of  Military Terminology, psychological warfare (→ p. 49) 
O consists above all in “using specific information and media [for] combat actions that 
N affect the psychology and behavior of  the target audience.”6 It comprises several 
S aspects including dissuasion (“to encourage a potential adversary to be cautious about 

joining a war or, ideally, to be opposed to fighting in a particular war”) and deception (“to 
develop false information to ‘draw the enemy’s attention’ and thereby adversely impact his 
decision-making”).7

C. Legal warfare D
U
C
T

The Chinese legal warfare (→ p. 51), which echoes Western debates on lawfare,8 refers I
O

to a strategic use of  the law. It is one of  the tools of  a non-kinetic war that offers influ- N
ence over an actor’s behavior to strategic ends. As with the two other components of  the 
“Three Warfares,” successful legal warfare limits the others’ freedom of  action while 
it increases that of  China. It provides a basis to entrench the legitimacy of  Chinese C
demands. As such, it is less a legal “war” than a rhetorical confrontation. The goal is to O
show that the law is on one’s side, whatever the (international or national) law may actu- N

C
ally state – even if  this means instrumentalizing courts for political ends. The military is E
indeed encouraged to identify and exploit the legal provisions favoring Chinese interests as P
much as possible, to ignore those that run counter to them, and hence to support a favor- T
able interpretation of  international law, even if  it differs from the accepted interpretation.9 S

III. “Cognitive domain operations”
A

Combat in the cognitive domain (认知领域作战) is one of  the concepts recently devel- C
T

oped by the PLA. The goal of  these operations is to constitute “a power to control the O
mind” (制脑权) or, in other words “using psychological warfare to shape or even control R
the enemy’s cognitive thinking and decision-making.”10 These concepts (cognitive S

domain operations and mind-control power) appeared in 2012,11 and the second was theo-
rized in a book published in January 2014,12 co-authored by Professor Zeng Huafeng (曾华
锋), the dean of  the School of  Humanities and Social Sciences at the National University 
of  Defense Technology (国防科技大学). Zeng defined mind control power as “using 
spiritual/psychological information disseminated by propaganda outlets, national language, A
cultural products, etc., as a tool to infiltrate, influence and even steer the nation’s public and C
its elites’ knowledge, emotion, and consciousness. The goal is to manipulate a country’s T

I
values, national spirit/ethos, ideologies, cultural traditions, historical beliefs, etc. O
to encourage them to abandon their theoretical understanding, social system, and N
development path and hence to achieve strategic objectives without fighting.”13 Activities S

in these areas are closely tied to the progress made in artificial intelligence.

U IV. Discursive power
C
T
I
O The notion of  discursive power (话语权) appeared in China at the end of  the 2000s.14 
N It was meant to replace the notion of  soft power (软实力) which had generated sustained 

debates following the translation of  Joseph Nye’s work at the beginning of  the 2000s. 
The emergence of  this discursive ambition for the Party in fact reflects the failure – or 

C at least the shortfalls – of  the policy of  building a Chinese soft power. This failure 
O was attributed not to the Party’s miscalculations but to the discursive domination 
N
C of  the great Western powers. Zhang Zhizhou (张志洲), in an article published on the 
E website of  the Chinese government’s Information Office,15 evoked the influence of  the 
P ideas of  Michel Foucault in the emergence of  the concept. Foucault is one of  the best-
T
S known French philosophers in China, even if  the understanding of  his thinking remains 

often “superficial and mundane.”16 The notion of  discursive power developed by Chinese 
intellectuals and the Party seems in this way to draw its inspiration from Michel Foucault’s 
inaugural lecture at the Collège de France entitled L’Ordre du discours (The Order of  Discourse). 
In it, Foucault notably defended the idea that access to the discursive space is always con-

A ditioned and that “speech does not simply translate the struggles and systems of  
C domination, but that it is what for which, by which we struggle – the power that we 
T seek to seize.”17 To seize a voice is to seize power, and to seize power is to exclude the 
O
R others’ voice. This is how the Party represents itself  on the international stage: incapable of  
S asserting its interests for lack of  a sufficiently audible voice.

In this context, the Party hopes to develop its capacity to influence the formulation 
of  norms, the construction of  values, governance structures, and so on. In other 
words, for want of  an ability to seduce the world, the Party seeks to dominate it by 
imposing its voice and its narratives. The notion of  discursive power, omnipresent in 
the diplomatic and cultural fields, has also been used in the military domain. For the PLA, 

A
C discursive power is based on the ability to shape information, beliefs, and minds (信息—
T 信仰—心智) in peacetime as well as in wartime, which includes times of  emergencies.18 
I Considerations on the discursive power in the military realm are thus partly linked to the 
O
N “Three Warfares” doctrine.19

motivations, objective reasoning, and the behavior of  the governments, organizations, 
groups, and individuals of  a target country in a way that is favorable to the acting country’s 
own political and military goals.20 This echoes the definition given by George Kennan in C
his famous 1948 telegram: broadly speaking, to “the employment of  all the means at a O
nation’s command, short of  war, to achieve its national objectives”.21 N

VI. Active measures S

Although the notion of  “active measures” comes not from China but from the Soviet 
Union, it is useful and it adequately complements the previous concepts in order to under-
stand the repertoire of  actions of  the Chinese actors.

Active measures (aктивные Мероприятия) are “the heart and soul of  Soviet intelligence,” A
in the words of  the former KGB general Oleg Kalugin.22 They were defined by Vasili C

T
Mitrokhin, a former senior KGB archivist, as “operational measures aimed at exerting use- O
ful influence on aspects of  the political life of  a target country which are of  interest, its for- R
eign policy, the solution of  international problems, misleading the adversary, undermining S

and weakening his positions, the disruption of  his hostile plans, and the achievement of  
other aims.”23 The Dictionary of  Counterintelligence used by the Higher School of  the KGB and 
published in 1972 referenced “acts of  counterintelligence making it possible to penetrate 
the intentions of  the enemy, allowing his unwanted steps to be anticipated, to lead 
the enemy into error, to take the initiative from him, to thwart his actions of  sabo- A
tage.”24 In the Soviet terminology, active measures were influence operations manufactured C

T
and carried out by the KGB and in particular by Service A of  the First Chief  Directorate I
(forbearer of  the SVR).25 They were carried out abroad to create a favorable environment O
for the USSR. For that reason, the classification of  these operations as counterintelligence N
may have been surprising but active measures were not conflated with defensive measures: S

rather, they were operations that fell in the oxymoronic category of  offensive defensive 
measures. Active measures were largely incorporated within the USSR’s foreign policy 
apparatus where they constituted a mode of  action seen as both regular and legitimate,26 
unlike in the United States and other Western countries where clandestine actions were 
perceived as falling outside of  ordinary law and were incidentally thought of  as exceptions.

U Active measures constituted a vast – and variable, according to the authors – repertoire

N tion of  foreign governments (via the organization of  protests for instance), provocation, 

false-flag operations and manipulations aimed at weakening the social cohesion

C created by the KGB and the creation of  façade structures (front organizations), offi-
O cially independent but that operated to the KGB and USSR’s advantage. Some experts also 
N included assassinations and terrorist actions.27 Whatever the means, the goal was always 
C
E to influence the policies pursued by a foreign actor.
P Certain scholars and experts have revisited the notion of  active measures since the con-
T flict in Ukraine to describe influence operations carried out by Russian intelligence agencies 
S (GRU, SVR, FSB) in the post-Soviet era. The notion is rarely used in the Chinese case how-

ever, but Chinese actors seem to have drawn from the repertoire of  tools created by the 
KGB to carry out their influence operations, as we will see with the case of  the operation 
we named “Infektion 2.0.,” which framed the origin of  the Covid-19 pandemic as American 
(→ p. 589). More generally, it will be featured in our conclusion on the “Russification” of

C Chinese strategies (→ p. 620).

THE UNITED FRONT:  I
O
N

THE PARTY’S “MAGIC WEAPON”
C
O
N
C
E

The notion of  the United Front remains insufficiently understood despite being an P
invaluable key to understanding the Communist Party’s influence operations. The first dif- T

S
ficulty undoubtedly comes from the confusion that arises from the ambiguous nature of  
the expression “United Front.” In the words of  Emmanuel Jourda, whose doctoral thesis 
constitutes the most complete work on the subject, the United Front designated a triple 
“dispositive of  thoughts on society, the organization of  the CCP, and the polit-
ical action.”1 In turn, Alex Joske differentiated between “[the] United Front (统一战 A
线), a coalition of  groups and individuals working toward the CCP’s goals; the work of  C
the United Front (统一战线工作) which refers to the CCP’s efforts to strengthen and T
expand the United Front by influencing and co-opting targets; the United Front Work O

R
Department (中央统一战线工作部), a CCP Central Committee department that coor- S
dinates and carries out the United Front’s actions; and the United Front system (统一战
线系统 or 统一战线工作系统), which brings together the agencies, social organizations, 
businesses, universities, research institutes and individuals carrying out the United Front’s 
activities.”2 At once a dedicated body within the Chinese Party-State apparatus and a 
galaxy of  actors orbiting around it, the United Front is not easily understood. A

A further difficulty comes from its broad spectrum, whose depth is often underesti- C
mated, ranging from “open” operations – i.e. public diplomacy undertaken by ambassa- T
dors across the world – to clandestine operations aiming to “undermine social cohesion, I
exacerbate racial tension, influence politics, harm media integrity, facilitate espionage, and O

N
increase unsupervised technology transfer.”3 While the UFWD is not an intelligence ser- S
vice per se, it can nevertheless offer a cover for intelligence officers carrying out clandestine 
actions and “recruiting” Taiwanese agents.4 Finally, understanding the United Front implies 
highlighting the historical trajectory of  this central CCP concept. 

After a brief  overview of  the key moments in the construction of  the concept of  the 
United Front, we mention the objectives and infrastructures on which its operations rely. 
Ultimately, we offer a typology of  United Front operations. C

U I. Concept of  Leninist origin
C
T
I
O The concept of  the United Front in China comes from a graft operated by the Comintern 
N at the beginning of  the 1920s. The concept finds its roots in the Communist Manifesto (1848) 

in which Marx and Engels considered possible temporary alliances between communists 
and democratic parties to accelerate the course of  history and to take power. Lenin, how-

C ever, is considered “the true father of  the United Front.”5 In his criticism of  Left-Wing 
O Communism: An Infantile Disorder (1920), he hammered home that to achieve the victory 
N
C of  communism, it was sometimes necessary to accept certain compromises, to seize the 
E “slightest possibility of  ensuring a numerically strong ally, be it a temporary ally, faltering, 
P conditional, fragile or insecure.”6 For Lenin, the United Front was a tactical collaboration, 
T
S considered as an intermediatory step before the victory of  communism. The Comintern 

then promoted the use of  the concept of  temporary alignment, allowing the reconciliation 
of  short-term demands and long-term objectives, in Europe as well as in Asia. The United 
Front is thus not a proper Chinese concept. 

In China, it was initially tied to the anti-Japanese alliance with the Kuomintang between 
A 1924 and 1927, and then from 1937 to 1945. The term used in Chinese was first Lianhe 
C Zhanxian (聯合戰線), before being replaced by Tongyi Zhanxian (統一戰線).7 In the late 
T 1930s, the Party took ownership of  the Leninist concept, modified its theoretical frame-
O
R work and used it as a vector of  its drive to take power. From 1938 on, Mao maintained 
S that the United Front, the building of  the Party’s and the armed struggle were the 

“magic weapons”8 (法宝) that would allow the communists to triumph, an expression 
that was picked up by several of  his successors (up until Xi Jinping) to benefit from his 
symbolic aura.

When the People’s Republic of  China was declared on October 1, 1949, the United 
Front became the tool to rally the majority around the party. The first United Front 

A
C national labor conference was held from March to April 1950. And the normative recog-
T nition of  the United Front landed in 1954, with its integration in the preamble of  the 
I Constitution. It now states that the “popular democratic United Front” makes itself  useful 
O
N in mobilizing and rallying “the entire population in the common struggle to achieve the 
S fundamental role of  the State during the transition,” but also to “confront internal and 

external enemies.”9 The CCP put in place a strategy found more or less everywhere across 
the communist world: communist parties collaborate with what Robert Havemann called 
the “empty acronyms,”10 namely parties without real positions and literally domesticated by 
the communist parties. This tactic was particularly developed after the Comintern’s Seventh 
Congress in 1935 which set building national fronts as a global strategy.11 Mao’s theory of  

C a new democracy is thus the Chinese implementation of  this United Front policy. Once 
A the regime was established, the United Front’s role was no longer to take power but to 
S
E perpetuate the CCP’s control. To do so, the United Front became at once the intellectual,

political, and organic framework to rally needed allies to the CCP while it silenced D
U

those it couldn’t persuade. C

After the disappearance of  the United Front during the Cultural Revolution, the institution T
I

was once again identified as a “magic weapon” in 1983. It was reemployed by the Party for O
N

its flexibility, its ability to forge ties (in other words, for its “primary function as a cohesive 
force”12), but also to fight against international criticisms following the Tian’anmen events.13 
The 18th United Front Work National Conference in 1993 marked the return of  the Chinese C
People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) as the body supervising the United Front. O
Created in 1949, it was considered the “United Front structure of  the whole Chinese demo- N
cratic people”14 before the United Front Work Department gained the upper hand. Bringing C

E
together representatives of  minority parties and other religious or independent ethnic groups, P
it has become the symbol of  a semblance of  political plurality and representativeness. Finally, T
the United Front accompanies the country’s growing international footprint in striving to S
strengthen links with the Chinese diaspora and to silence opposition to the CCP abroad.

II. Revival and diversification of  the United Front under Xi A
Jinping C

T
O

Since coming to power in 2012, Xi Jinping has reinvigorated the United Front, R
with which he was already very familiar: his father had contributed to its activities in S

Tibet and Xi wrote an article about its work in the diaspora in 1995, while he was the Party 
secretary in the city of  Fuzhou. The new CCP Secretary worked to reform the United Front 
after having purged the director of  the UFWD, Ling Jihua (令计划) in December 2014, 
because he had been a close ally to former secretary Hu Jintao (胡锦涛). His goal was to 
correct what he saw as the shortcomings of  the United Front and put it once again at the A
heart of  Party’s action. Xi pointed out that the United Front was not sufficiently united, and C
insisted that its work should be carried out by all Party members.15 T

I
In May 2015, the United Front Work National Labor Conference was raised to the O

rank of  central conference, thereby acknowledging its increased importance. The same N
year, a steering group of  the Central Committee for United Front activities was established, S

and the first provisional ruling on United Front activities published.16 The United Front 
Work Department saw its number of  offices increase to account for the new targets 
(→ p. 68). The goal of  the reforms was to ensure a better coordination of  the activities 
of  the United Front and to reinforce the Party’s control on the structures. It also enlarged 
its perimeter of  activities to include the protection of  the Party: in his report to the 19th

D
U Congress, Xi Jinping spoke of  drawing, with the United Front, the widest possible 
C concentric circle around the Party.17 
T
I From a rhetorical point of  view, the reference to a “magic weapon” was reactivated. Xi 
O
N Jinping also brought the expression “Great United Front” (大统战) back into fashion, which 

had initially been promoted by a theoretician from the Central Institute of  Socialism in 1993. 
Its meaning seems, however, to have evolved. According to another theoretician from the 

C Institute, this is the most distinctive characteristic of  United Front thinking in the Xi Jinping 
O era:18 it insists more than ever on the strategic importance of  the United Front and on the 
N necessity to improve its coordination.19 For Gerry Groot, the new “Great United Front” is no 
C
E longer limited to representing and creating links between different social groups in order to 
P exert control over them, but it is a method that can go as far as forcing the assimilation 
T into the dominant Han culture, using methods such as mass internment.20

S The United Front is therefore a Communist Party policy devised to develop and 
reinforce its hegemony. The activities of  the United Front consist in allying with or 
neutralizing groups situated outside the sphere of  CCP control to ensure its role as the 
sole legitimate representative of  the Chinese people. Concretely, this means eliminating 
domestic and external enemies, controlling groups that could defy CCP authority, 

A
C building a coalition around the Party in order to serve its interests, and projecting 
T its influence abroad in such a way that even individuals and groups based in liberal 
O societies are brought to censor themselves and avoid taking a position against the 
R
S CCP.21 The United Front accordingly takes on a considerable part in the influence opera-

tions carried out by the Party.

III. Objectives
A
C The United Front is a policy that essentially “uses the friends of  the Party to fight its 
T enemies.” It should be thought of  as a strategy deployed in concentric circles and 
I
O whose ambition is to bring together the largest possible population. This is therefore 
N not a Chinese policy but rather a policy of  the Party, employed in China as well as overseas. 
S Wherever the Party is threatened, the United Front system is active.

The Party distinguishes twelve primary targets, which correspond to the twelve offices 
of  the UFWD (→ p. 68): the members of  eight minority parties (known as the eight demo-
cratic parties); individuals without a party affiliation, intellectuals not linked to the Party, eth-
nic minorities; religious individuals; private companies; urban professionals; students studying 
or returning from studies abroad; residents of  Hong Kong and Macao; the Taiwanese and

their relatives in mainland China; individuals of  Chinese ancestry throughout the world (dias- D

poras) and their relatives in mainland China; and all the other individuals requiring “unity and C

connection.”22 This list illustrates the continuity between domestic spaces and the rest T
I

of  the world: the only meaningful distinction for a United Front that operates every- O
N

where, inside and outside of  the country, is between the Party and the rest. The goal is 
to control this dozen priority targets, to prevent them from doing harm on the one hand and, 
on the other, to incite or force them to act as representatives of  the Party. C

In this respect, the goals of  the United Front should also be understood in light of  the O
2015 National Security Law (中华人民共和国国家安全法).23 As Peter Mattis rightly not- N
ed,24 Article 2 of  the law defines security as the absence of  domestic or external threat C

E
(没有危险和不受内外威胁的状态), which legitimates preventative actions to reduce any P
threat. The law furthermore adopts a particularly extensive definition of  national security T
– much broader than the 1993 version of  the law which mostly focused on protection S
against espionage. This law also includes culture since the Party fears “cultural infil-
tration” (文化渗透),25 in other words the penetration into China of  Western values that are 
deemed subversive (rule of  law, democracy, liberalism), but also ideas that could weakened 
the CCP’s legitimacy and monopoly. It is therefore fundamental for the Party to control 
the realm of  ideas and, consequently, the narratives that construct China’s image abroad A

C
and which shape the environment in which it evolves. In this interpretative framework, it T
is understood that the diaspora constitutes a priority target for the Party; Chinese of  O
the diasporas, via their command of  local cultural codes, are indeed the most likely R

S
to import democratic values into China and thereby to threaten the Party.26 Control 
over these diasporas, and by extension the elimination of  all cultural threats, makes the 
United Front’s missions an absolute priority for the Party. To this end, United Front activi-
ties are coordinated by the UFWD but can be carried out by a broad spectrum of  actors in 
the Party, a nexus that can be referred to as the “United Front system.”

Actors implementing the work of  the United Front can be found wherever the Party S
exists – from the Central Committee to provincial and municipal offices, youth leagues to 
unions, diplomats posted overseas to branches of  the Xinhua press agency, but also inside 
the large state-owned companies and numerous universities and research centers. 

The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is the highest 
supervisory and coordinating body of  the United Front system. The UFWD is required to 
follow its directives. Then, numerous organizations are directly subordinate to, or maintain C
close ties with, the UFWD. It is not easy to draw up an exhaustive list as these ramifications A

S
can be sprawling – and they have been since the creation of  the regime: a 1957 CIA report, E
declassified in 1999, presented an instructive list that revealed the United Front’s capacity

the Global Chinese Language Media; the journals China Religion (中国宗教), China Tibet

E The Western Returned Scholars Association
P
T The Western Returned Scholars Association (WRSA), founded in 1913 by Chinese re-
S formist intellectuals, and which name literally means the association of  students in Europe 

and America (欧美同学会)29 currently brings together 40,000 Chinese students and scholars 
and it has branches in 15 countries including in France (its headquarters are in Marseille). Its 
secretary general is a UFWD executive. It is used, for instance, to develop relationships with 
foreign think tanks and to contribute to recruiting foreign researchers for Chinese research 
centers and companies via the “Thousand Talents” program put in place in 2008 (→ p. 292). 

A The WRSA also created the Center for China and Globalization (CCG), a self-described 
C “non-governmental” think tank based in Beijing, and whose president, Wang Huiyao (王辉

T 耀), also a member of  several United Front groups, is a UFWD advisor and one of  the think-
O ing heads behind the Chinese strategy of  international recruitment.30 According to Intelligence 
R Online, which cites a few names, “in order to expand its network, CCG has recruited as consul-
S tants former foreign officials from the political, economic and academic worlds.”31

• Education and Research:
Here, we can mention the Beijing Chinese Language and Culture College (北京华

A 文学院), dedicated to students of  Chinese origin who have returned to China; Jinan 
C University (暨南大学), based in Guangzhou, which is one of  the oldest Chinese uni-
T versities, one of  the first to have welcomed foreign students and currently one of  the 
I universities in China hosting the most of  them; Huaqiao University (华侨大学), based 
O
N in Xiamen and Quanzhou, in Fujian – whose name literally means “Overseas Chinese 
S University”; the China Tibetan Language High Institute of  Buddhism (中国藏语系高

级佛学院), which teaches a “patriotic” Tibetan Buddhism, and so on. Besides, most 
Chinese universities host local UFWD branches that monitor students as well as 
instructors, handle student informers and establish databases on everyone.32 The

incidentally admitted that the UFWD is actually responsible for the “general orientation 
of  student associations abroad.”33

C
• Diasporic affairs: O

N
Since March 2018, the diaspora falls under the direct responsibility of  the UFWD, C
whereas this responsibility was previously shared between the Office of  Overseas E

P
Affairs and the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs.34 The diaspora being an imaginary com- T
munity, since it is in fact extremely diverse, United Front efforts consist in shaping, S
controlling, and homogenizing its constituent groups. Also falling under the United 
Front are the All-China Federation of  Returned Overseas Chinese (中华全国归国华
侨联合会), the China Overseas Friendship Association (中华海外联谊会), Huangpu 
Military Academy Alumni Association (黄埔军校 同学会统战), the All-China Taiwan 
Compatriots Organization (中华全国台湾同胞联谊会), and the China Council for the A
Promotion of  Peaceful National Reunification (中国和平统一促进会), which manages C

T
a network of  branches worldwide (→ p. 124).35 O
• Economy: R

S
Several organizations contribute to the work of  the United Front, including the Huaxing 
Economic Advisory Service Center (华兴经济咨询服务中心), which provides eco-
nomic consulting services, and the All-China Federation of  Industry and Commerce (
中华全国工商业联 合会).36 The large state-owned companies generally have an 
internal United Front section, such as the world’s leading steel manufacturer, China A
Baowu Steel Group, the former CEO of  which (2007-2016) became vice-Minister of  C
the UFWD. Chinese and foreign private companies are also increasingly a target. T
Deloitte China, for example, has had an internal United Front association since 2016, I

O
run by the CEO himself.37

N
• Culture: S

The cultural sector is also the object of  major United Front operations. The Chinese 
Literature and Art Federation (中国文学艺术联合会),38 and the Confucius Institutes 
(→ p. 299), are supervised by the United Front and represent powerful levers of  mobili-
zation, intelligence gathering, and informational warfare across the world.

C
The actors of  the United Front system sometimes tend, when acting abroad, to enter A

into partnerships with prestigious foreign institutions to “whitewash” their activities. This S

C V. Typology of  United Front operations
O
N
C The work of  the United Front consists first of  all in identifying and classifying the 
E targets and enemies of  the Party. There exist, in particular, enemies of  first or second 
P
T rank, those that cannot be fought and those with whom it is possible to form an alliance 
S before combatting them.40 This work is done via the recruitment of  supporters for the 

Communist regime, attempts to influence individuals who are prominent in their 
respective fields or in their countries, controls exerted over groups challenging the 
Party’s authority, intelligence gathering, and the elimination, or at least disruption, 
of  the Party’s enemies.41 The work of  the United Front, inseparable from that of  the 

A Party-State, is nevertheless “hardly perceptible in its details,” as “everything pertaining to 
C the activities of  representative personalities is theoretically tied to the United Front.”42 
T
O Besides, its operations have the distinctive characteristic of  being frequently conducted by 
R front organizations whose proximity to the United Front is not always obvious.43

S The United Front has, in theory, total freedom to mobilize individuals and social groups 
in favor of  the CCP’s objectives and ambitions. We can nevertheless identify three principal 
types of  operations under which the other more or less fall. 

A. Mobilizing the diasporas
A
C
T Overseas executives and agents of  the United Front are primarily tasked with working 
I with the Chinese diasporas in order to circulate the Party’s narratives and its interpretation 
O of  global affairs, but also in order to mobilize them when necessary. The diasporas are thus 
N
S instrumentalized to exert pressure on governments whose policies contradict the Party’s 

interests. This can include protesting against visits by individuals like the Hong Kong activ-
ist Joshua Wong or the Dalai Lama, movements sympathetic to Hong Kong protestors, or 
events on Tibet or Xinjiang.44 Diasporas can also be “positively” mobilized to support the 
visit of  a Chinese official in their host country.

The United Front also aims to ensure that, throughout the world and in all languages, I

the way in which media, journalists, editorialists, researchers, instructors, etc. report on N
China conforms to the Party’s interests, particularly on the most sensitive subjects, such 
as the “five poisons” (Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong, pro-democracy activists, Taiwanese 
separatists). This desire to control the narratives about China leads the Party to deploy C
its charms toward key opinion-shapers (researchers, journalists, businessmen, politicians, O
social media influencers). This strategy most often takes the form of  leisure trips paid for N

C
by the Party during which Chinese leaders pull out all the stops. E

The United Front also takes on the work of  collecting data profiling the political or reli-
gious preferences of  university students, politicians, public figures, and others. Whether vast 
(one database is believed to contain information on 2.2 million Chinese scientists abroad) 
or very precise (another targets Chinese doctoral students in the United States originating A

C
from one particular town in China),45 the goal is the same: to provide the United Front with T
the means to expand, thus to extend the Party’s influence. Public and private companies O
play an important role in this collection of  personal data (→ p. 129). R

THE “THREE WARFARES” I
O
N

C
O
N
C
E

The “Three Warfares” strategy is one of  the main doctrines of  the People’s Liberation P
Army (PLA) but, like the United Front, it remains relatively unknown, or at least insuffi- T

S
ciently taken into consideration, despite the publication of  several books and articles on the 
subject.1 These “Three Warfares” – public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, 
and legal warfare – represent most of  the Chinese political warfare, understood as all 
the forms of  non-military confrontation that can be used to achieve a strategic objective.2 

This three-front strategy of  political warfare was officially adopted in 2003 by the Central A
Committee of  the CCP and the Central Military Commission (CMC) with the revised “PLA C
Political Work Regulations.” It noted that wartime political work ought to include the imple- T
mentation of  public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and legal warfare.3 The 2010 O

R
revision added that all members of  the military had to be trained in the “Three Warfares” S
(Art. 14 §17); that military propaganda had to include public opinion warfare (Art. 14 §10); 
that liaison work had to include psychological warfare (Art. 14 §14); and that political, legal 
(Art. 14 §7) as well as judicial work (Art. 14 §9) had to include legal warfare.4

Political warfare is understood as a form of  non-kinetic conflict. While it can take 
diverse forms, the logic remains the same: political warfare is used to win without fight- A
ing (不战而胜) – or at least to achieve a broad victory with limited combats (小战大 C
胜) – so that enemy troops admit defeat without ever having fought (不战而屈人之兵).5 T
It is undertaken in wartime as well as peacetime (平战结合). The “Three Warfares” I

U are sometimes considered as a strategy of  hybrid warfare to the extent that they blur the 
C boundaries between war and peace, between combatants and civilians, and between mili-
T
I tary and non-military means.6 Franck Hoffman’s definition echoes the “Three Warfares,” 
O
N referring to the coordinated use of  different types of  warfare jointly employed and creating 

a synergistic effect between the physical and psychological dimensions of  conflict.7 It is 
important, however, not to confuse them, especially because the concept of  “hybrid war” 

C itself  is not precisely-defined. 
O With the development of  information and communication technologies, and the speed 
N with which ideas can circulate worldwide, the “Three Warfares” are understood as a means 
C
E to develop a discursive power (话语权), in other words the ability to influence the per-
P ceptions of  a target audience, control narratives and impose one’s own version of  the facts.8 
T For that reason they are also portrayed as a confrontation in the cognitive domain (认
S 知领域的对抗).9 Their goal is to influence potentially destabilizing actors to deter them 

from taking any action against China.10 The “Three Warfares” could also be understood as 
a form of  psychological warfare in the broadest sense. Others have underlined that this 
strategy is comparable to the anti-access, area denial strategy (A2/AD), here applied 
to the realm of  ideas.11 These three types of  offensive operations in peacetime pursue the 

A
C same goal, that of  shaping an environment favorable to China (meaning to the Party) 
T and unfavorable to its enemies in order to limit their freedom of  action and to meet the 
O regime’s objectives. Their mission is to allow the PLA to seize the decisive opportunity (先
R
S 机) and retain the initiative (主动). They are force multipliers.12

Last but not least, the “Three Warfares” must be understood as a strategy to strengthen 
the Party’s political power, in the same way as the United Front. As the CCP’s armed 
wing, the PLA’s principal mission is to guarantee the regime’s survival and augment the 
CCP’s power. For Peter Mattis, the “Three Warfares” could even be understood as an 
outgrowth of  the United Front system and of  the Party’s propaganda.13 As previ-

A ously outlined, the United Front’s work consists in forming alliances with or neutralizing 
C
T the groups outside the reach of  the CCP to impose the Party as the one and only legitimate 
I representative of  the Chinese people. The “Three Warfares” need to be understood as part 
O and parcel of  this policy and these efforts complement those of  the United Front. 
N
S The conceptual origin of  the notion is unclear. If  its principles echo those of  classical 

Chinese military strategy, notably Sun Zi, according to whom “to win one hundred victories 
in one hundred battles is not the acme of  skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the 
acme of  skill,”14 nothing proves that these ancient roots have had a decisive influence on 

C 6. “Hybrid Warfare with Chinese Characteristics” is the title that Michael Raska chose for a short article describing 
A the “Three Warfares” strategy in RSIS Commentary, 262 (2015). There is no agreement on whether the “Three Warfares” 
S should be labelled hybrid warfare however. See, for example: Michael Clarke, “China’s Application of  the ‘Three 
E Warfares’ in the South China Sea and Xinjiang,” Orbis (Jan. 2019), 192.

the development of  the “Three Warfares.” A possible influence could however have been D
U

the Introduction to Psychological Warfare published in 1990 by the National Defense University.15 C

There is also an American root to a certain extent. When the Central Committee and T
I

the CMC adopted the “Three Warfares” strategy in 2003, it was not seen as a new strategy O
N

conceived to get a head start over others, but as a necessary step to make up for China hav-
ing fallen behind compared to other countries. From a Chinese perspective, the United 
States is the champion of  public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and legal C
warfare. As they studied recent wars undertaken by Washington, from the 1991 Gulf  War O
which “made China aware of  the considerable limits of  its own capacities” in this domain,16 N
to the 2003 Iraq War (by way of  the Balkans), Chinese analysts concluded that modern C

E
warfare could be won thanks to non-military operations and non-kinetic capabilities.17 They P
maintain that the United States was the first to employ propaganda and techniques manipu- T
lating public opinions, psychological attacks, and offensive legal maneuvers in a coordinated S
manner to make their enemies fold.18 

The insertion of  the “Three Warfares” in the 2003 revision of  the “PLA Political Work 
Regulations” did not, however, mark the beginning of  the use of  these techniques by China; 
it was an official endorsement instead, and an injunction for their coordinated implemen-
tation at all levels. The execution of  the “Three Warfares” strategy was coordinated by A

C
the Liaison Department of  the former General Political Department (LD/GPD) which T
used to oversee political warfare. Since the 2015 military reforms, the Liaison Department O
of  the new Political Work Department (LD/PWD) has probably inherited this mission. R

S
Theoretically, all levels of  the PLA are called to carry out the “Three Warfares,” but 
at least one PLA base is specifically dedicated to this mission: Base 311, also known 
as PLA Unit 61716 located in Fuzhou, in Fujian province, which faces Taiwan (→ p. 89). 
The “Three Warfares” strategy addresses both external and internal threats, like 
the Taiwanese independence movement, which is one of  its principal targets. It applies to 
members of  the military but also to civilians, as the Party mobilizes all its branches along A
with intermediaries to strengthen its power. The Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, for example, C

T
plays a particular role in the diffusion of  the Chinese discourse overseas via its network of  I
embassies – a role falling at once under the United Front and the “Three Warfares.” O

The “Three Warfares” are considered as the three arms of  the same body. They serve N
S

the same strategic objective, are employed with the same logic, and are reinforcing each 
other, each one paving the ground for the development of  the other two. Public opinion 
warfare offers a combat platform to psychological warfare and legal warfare. Legal warfare 
provides the necessary legal bases for public opinion warfare and psychological warfare. 
Finally, public opinion warfare and legal warfare both require psychological influence over 
the public to be effective.19 C

U I. Public opinion warfare
C
T
I
O The goal of  public opinion warfare is to win over target audiences – those of  enemy 
N countries but also the international community – on the position defended by the govern-

ment. The issue is not so much to know which armed forces will win, but which narra-
tive, which version of  the facts will prevail in a public opinion. Concretely, public opinion 

C warfare, as conceptualized by the Chinese, consists in carrying out the “cognitive ori-
O entation” (引导认知) of  the masses, to “excite their emotions” (激发情感) and to 
N
C “constrain their behavior” (约束行为).20 This is an activity that can be carried at low 
E intensity as it is a continuous, permanent, and long-term endeavor: its goal is to surrepti-
P tiously shape the psyche.
T
S All the media can be mobilized: the press, radio, television, social networks (Facebook, 

YouTube, Twitter, WeChat, Weibo, TikTok, Plurk, etc.), films, and books. They are used to 
impose a version of  the facts as early as possible and to frame the debate – since the 
first impression makes more of  a mark than the subsequent ones, even if  it is a mistaken 
one (this is known as the anchoring bias in cognitive psychology). To carry out successful 

A public opinion warfare, one must be the first to react and to multiply sources defending this 
C version of  the facts, while eventually (but not systematically) concealing the ties that might 
T lead back to the acting political source, in order to influence the perceptions and behavior 
O
R of  target audiences. To impose their narrative, the protagonists of  the Three Warfares 
S can also lean on the illusion-of-truth effect, a bias according to which the probability of  

believing false information depends not on its logical nature but on an individual’s famil-
iarity with the idea.21 

By way of  example, a video defending Chinese sovereignty in the South China Sea was 
shown approximately 120 times per day on a 200-square-meter screen in Times Square in 
New York City between July 23 and August 3, 2016.22 Earlier, on July 12, the Permanent

C Court of  Arbitration in The Hague had disavowed Beijing by indicating, among other 
T things, that China did not have historical rights over the South China Sea. The 3-minute 
I video subsequently broadcast suggested that the British MP Catherine West supported 
O
N the Chinese position, even though she had accepted the interview only to express her 
S support for a peaceful resolution of  the tensions and did not expect the distorted use of  

her remarks.23 The video’s authors selected several words from her statement and placed 
them between those of  three other individuals, whose remarks could not be clearer, and 
with whom the MP thus seemed to agree: Wu Shicun, president of  the National Institute 
of  South China Sea Studies; John Ross, introduced only as the former director of  the 
Department of  Economic Policy for the Mayor of  London, while he was also a columnist

II. Psychological Warfare
Psychological warfare is used to demoralize and dissuade enemy forces, making A

them doubt, and even to terrorize them in order to undermine their ability and willing- C
ness to fight. It is used to break the bond of  trust between those governing and those T
governed and to disrupt the decision-making process of  the enemy country. In other I

O
words, it is used to defeat the enemy without a fight. Strictly speaking, psychological war- N
fare is more frequently employed in wartime than peacetime, unlike public opinion warfare S
which is constantly used whatever the level of  tensions, and which targets a larger audience 
than psychological warfare.

A work released by the PLA publishing house distinguished four types of  psychologi-
cal warfare: “coercion” (威慑), which seeks to force the other to adopt a certain behavior; 
“mystification” (欺诈), which spreads confusion and misleads; “division” (离间), which 
takes advantage of  all potential weaknesses and disagreements within the enemy country C
and paralyzes its decision-making process, breaks the motivation of  the enemy’s fighters A

T
I The actions carried out by the Chinese communist regime against the Uyghur 
O
N ethnic minority in China (and overseas), is an example of  psychological (but also physi-

cal) warfare, which would correspond to the coercive type presented above. Random arrests, 
mass internment, forced labor, digital tracing, frequent inspections, forced Sinicization, 

C “reeducation” of  children, destruction of  places of  worship, harassment, settlement of  
O nomads… the Uyghurs, a majority-Muslim Turkic ethnic group, are violently repressed 
N in the name of  the fight against religious extremism.29 It is estimated that one to three 
C
E million Uyghurs are currently interned. Women are subjected to forced sterilization,30 but 
P also other “impos[ed] measures [intend] to prevent births within the group”31 – all acts 
T that legally constitute a crime of  genocide.32 Prisoners have also presumably had organs 
S removed (which Beijing did openly on persons sentenced to death until 2015 → p. 214). It 

feeds a lucrative traffic of  “halal” organs exported to the Gulf  countries.33 Numerous tes-
timonials prove that the Uyghurs are terrorized; they fear that the smallest gesture or word 
could be used against them, they do not dare to speak to strangers, and they do not know 
if  one day they will see their relatives disappear. Fear of  the central government follows 

A
C them beyond the Chinese border, even when some manage to flee to another country.34 
T This psychological warfare aims to force the Uyghurs to adopt the behavior desired by the 
O central government: submission. This example reminds us that the “Three Warfares” are 
R
S not limited to external threats: any threat to the Party, whether inside or outside of  China, 

must be annihilated.
There are additional examples: the actions taken by Beijing to paralyze the enemy’s 

decision-making process during the Sino-Indian confrontation on the Doklam plateau, 
in the summer 2017, fit the different types of  psychological warfare presented above. The 
Party-State did not hesitate to regularly utter threats such as: “military conflicts to escalate

U

also accused the Indian Minister of  Foreign Affairs at the time, Sushma Swaraj, of  having C

lied in front of  the Parliament when she claimed that India had the support of  the inter- T

N

its opponent: videos showing Chinese military exercises in Tibet, not far from the Indian 
border, were broadcast; military equipment and logistic materiel were moved closer to the 
line of  conflict, thus suggesting a possible escalation of  the hostilities; and memories of  C
the Chinese victory in the 1962 Sino-Indian conflict were revived to demoralize Indian O
soldiers.39 The role that this campaign of  psychological warfare played in the conflict’s N
outcome was nevertheless uncertain and difficult to measure. C

III. Legal warfare
Several Chinese articles have defined legal warfare as the use of  law as a “weapon of  A

war” (以法律为武器), i.e. to dissuade, attack, counter-attack, coerce, and punish. C
Its implementation consists in instrumentalizing legal principles to achieve an advantage, T

O
acquire normative superiority, and allow the PLA to keep the initiative.40 Attaining this nor- R
mative superiority is not only a question of  positive law, but indeed of  using all the legal S
and moral principles on which the Chinese can rely to justify their actions. Legal warfare 
is pursued throughout the war-peace continuum: before a conflict, it is used to set up the 
right conditions and allow China to have law “on its side”; during a conflict, it justifies the 
use of  force and legitimizes the PLA’s actions; after a conflict, it is used to retain any gains 
or to claim its due. A

The practice itself  is not new, but several factors, including the judicialization of  inter- C
national relations, the democratization of  political regimes, as well as the rise of  new infor- T
mation and communication technologies, explain its increasing deployment.41 In the case I

O
of  China, the most commonly cited examples are its actions in favor of  a revisionist N
interpretation of  maritime law to serve its interests in the South China Sea and prohibit S
access to the area, especially by the United States. Singapore-based RSIS researcher Collin 
Koh explained that, in practice, Beijing “tries to take advantage of  its growing military 
power to constrain coastal states on the South China Sea to renounce exercising their legit-
imate rights, guaranteed by the UN Convention, to exploit the resources situated in their

U Exclusive Economic Zones.”42 To the UN Convention on the Law of  the Sea, the Party-
C State opposes “historical rights” that are devoid of  any legal basis. It refuses to recognize 
T
I the decision of  the Permanent Court of  Arbitration of  The Hague which stated in 2016 
O
N that the “Nine-dash line” (the Chinese territorial claim) had “no legal basis”; nonetheless, 

China multiplies incidents, involving its civilian flotillas – including its coast guards43 – and 
maritime militias, as part of  an offensive that falls within the “grey area” of  “hybrid war-
fare.”44

C  Overall, this policy of  the fait accompli puts China as a “revisionist state in interna-
O tional maritime law.”45 This legal warfare also includes participation in the development of  
N norms through international organizations, efforts within these to promote the emer-
C
E gence of  interpretations favorable to Chinese demands, to influence individuals playing a 
P normative role, or to create precedents to serve as future normative bases.
T Besides, the Party uses intermediaries to carry out the “Three Warfares.” In the case of  
S the legal warfare, United Front organizations like the All China Lawyers Association (ANAC, 

中华全国律师协会) may be playing a role.46 The ANAC, for that matter, organized a Global 
Lawyer’s Forum in December 2019 with some 800 organizations and individuals, and it 
founded the Belt and Road International Lawyers Alliance (一带一路律师联盟) to promote 
legal cooperation between member states and the BRI.47 This type of  platform could be serv-

A
C ing as a relay for the Party to implement legal warfare, for example, by allowing it to impose 
T its interpretation of  international law more easily on its interlocutors. 
O A recent example of  defensive legal warfare is the initiative separately taken by two 
R
S Chinese lawyers, Liang Xuguang in Wuhan and Chen Yueqin in Beijing, to press charges 

against the United States as part of  the Covid-19 pandemic in response to complaints 
lodged by Americans accusing China of  being responsible for the health disaster. Even if  
this type of  complaints is unlikely to result in a conviction on either side, it is useful for the 
Chinese to supply a counter-narrative and turn the blame onto the actor slandering 
them. Liang and Chen for instance accused the United States of  having concealed the 

A epidemic’s emergence on its soil and undermined China’s image in naming Covid-19 the 
C
T “Chinese virus.”48 In a hypothetical scenario of  offensive legal warfare, China could be 
I imagined as inciting Pacific nations threatened by rising sea levels to bring charges against 
O the United States on the grounds that, due to insufficient respect of  the environment, the 
N
S US bears responsibility for its disastrous environmental consequences on these states. 

An additional example is the Hong Kong national security law passed by Beijing 
on June 30, 2020, and the extraterritoriality of  Article 38 more specifically, which 
criminalized the least violation of  the law committed by anyone, anywhere in the 
world. The first to be concerned are Hongkongers temporarily living overseas, especially 
the thousands of  students who, on Australian, American, Canadian or European campuses,

expressed support for the pro-democracy activists, as well as all those who did so on social D

media, and who were hesitant to return home in case the law could be retroactively invoked C

by the authorities to pursue them. Certain instructors in Chinese studies reacted quickly, T
I

adapting their courses to limit the risks for these students without making concessions on O
N

the content.49 Certain universities, like Dartmouth College in the United States or Oxford 
University in the United Kingdom, took action: students are allowed to opt out from certain 
courses and to submit their work anonymously, which limits the risks of  denunciation.50

C
This law applies not only to students but to everyone, everywhere: all those who crit- O

icize the CCP, including this report’s authors, can now be arrested and pursued if  N
they travel to Hong Kong, mainland China, or even third-party countries that allow C

E
Chinese authorities to act on their soil. Law Professor Donald Clarke concluded his P
analysis of  Article 38 as such: “I do not recommend Thailand if  you’re in the PRC govern- T
ment’s sights.”51 S

More generally, the Chinese lawfare implies “the use or threat of  legal action – to 
intimidate, silence and impose financial and psychological costs” on anyone (includ-
ing journalists and researchers) who work on topics Beijing hopes to dissimulate.52 
In France, for example, the researcher Valérie Niquet is being sued for defamation by 
Huawei France because she said, during a television broadcast (whose host and production A

C
company are also being sued), that “Huawei is directly under the control of  the state and T
the CCP, which has a real power strategy.”53 In Taiwan, judicial proceedings or threats O
thereof  are common intimidation tactics: “the Financial Times, Taiwan’s government-run R

真相), were the object of  such ‘lawfare,’”54 recounted Canadian researcher J. Michael

demonstrate the depth of  the repression that fell on the Uyghurs, confirming, for instance, 
the existence of  internment camps and a forced sterilization campaign on women. Zenz

C courts by individuals and firms from Xinjiang (not named in the article however, but they 
T
I acted as the Party’s cover).57 According to the Global Times, the BBC will be the next target 
O
N of  the legal warfare “for producing fake news [and] spreading rumors about Xinjiang.”58 

The aim of  these charges is not to win but to “impose a cost.” These companies, with 
enormous resources at their disposal, can recruit the best law firms and finance long-lasting 

C procedures. On the other side, the journalists and researchers they attack are alone, with few 
O resources. The effect is dissuasive, first of  all for the targeted individuals. J. Michael Cole 
N admitted that, even though his case won up to the nation’s highest court, “in a way they win 
C
E because to this day I’m reluctant to write about them.”59 The dissuasive effect also extends 
P – which is in any case the desired goal – to the entirety of  the field concerned: matters like 
T this cause a sensation in journalistic and academic circles, reinforcing pre-existing tendencies 
S toward self-censorship, as most do not wish to “have problems.” For that reason, it is not even 

necessary to go through with the lawsuits: the threat is sometimes enough. Hence, Chinese 
authorities and their mouthpieces, firms and media outlets, only mention the threat without 
following through. In France, for instance, the director of  the digital version of  the People’s 
Daily repeatedly threatened a number of  journalists in March 2021.60

This well-known practice, known as a gag lawsuit, or procedure, but also called a D
U

“strategic lawsuit against public participation” by the United States during the 1980s, is a C

classic tool of  legal warfare, obviously not limited to China. Yet, it is a growing problem, T
I

especially for journalists, researchers, NGOs, and whistleblowers who, in numerous coun- O
N

tries, are regularly targeted by private companies or public institutions who wish to silence 
them.

C
The Chinese concepts of  influence fit into a global framework. The CCP indeed sees O

itself  as engaged in an ideological rivalry with the West, first of  all with the United States. N
Competition with Washington is thus not only about material superiority, but also about C

E
the imposition of  values, norms, and institutions on the adversary. This is where the P
struggle between Beijing and Washington differs from the Cold War: The United States T
and China share the same world, they cannot live separately in two worlds with diver- S
gent norms. The CCP’s aim is therefore to impose a globalization under the aegis of  
Chinese norms. It is precisely the essence of  the Party’s leitmotif  of  “a common destiny 
for humanity” (→ p. 149).

SUMMARY OF THE FIRST PART C
O
N
C
E

The two most important concepts in Chinese influence operations are: P
T

• The United Front, a CCP policy whose goal is to build up and reinforce its hegemony in S
shaping forces outside the Party and in “mobilizing the Party’s friends to strike its enemies.” The 
expression is relatively hard to define since it designates at once a dedicated organization (the 
United Front Work Department, UFWD, under the authority of  the Chinese People’s Political 
Consultative Conference, CPPCC), an activity (the work of  the United Front), and a system (the 
constellation of  organizations, institutions, agencies, and individuals who carry out this work A
across all sectors: media, education and research, diaspora, economy, culture, etc.). C

Concretely, its work consists in eliminating internal and external enemies, controlling the T
O

groups that could defy the CCP’s authority, building a coalition around the Party to serve its R
interests, and projecting its influence overseas to such an extent that even individuals and groups S
residing in liberal societies censor themselves or avoid taking a stance against the CCP. These op-
erations – across a broad spectrum ranging from “open” public diplomacy to clandestine actions 
– generally aim at one of  the following three objectives: to mobilize the diasporas, to control the 
narratives about China, and to create databases.

• The Three Warfares, which represent most of  the “political warfare” carried out by the A
PLA, is a form of  non-kinetic conflictuality aimed at winning without fighting by shaping an C
environment favorable to China (i.e. to the Party) and unfavorable to its enemies. Undertaken in T

I
times of  war as well as peace, it is made up of  three arms from the same body: O

- Public opinion warfare, whose objective is to unite the target audiences, mold psyches N
(“cognitive orientation” of  the masses), “rouse their emotions,” and “constrain their behavior”; S

- Psychological warfare, used to demoralize enemy forces, dissuade, sow doubt, and even 
terrorize them to undermine their ability and will to fight, to weaken the bond of  trust between 
rulers and citizens, but also to disrupt the decision-making process in the enemy country;

- Legal warfare, which is the use of  law as a weapon of  war, meaning to dissuade, attack, 
counter-attack, coerce, and discipline, as shown in the revisionist interpretation of  maritime law, 
the 2020 Hong Kong national security law, and a growing number of  judicial proceedings. The C
CCP goes after any individual opposed to its interests, and as frequently as possible, most often A
via accusations of  defamation (gag lawsuits whose goal is not to win but to impose a cost and S
thus have a deterrent effect). E

• The other relevant concepts to understand Chinese influence operations are the notion of  
cognitive-domain operations, which aim at “shap[ing] or even control[ing] the enemy’s cogni-
tive thinking and decision-making” and manipulating “a country’s values, national spirit/ethos, 
ideologies, cultural traditions, historical beliefs, etc. to encourage them to abandon their theoret- C

ical understanding, social system, and development path”; the discursive power, which aims at O
N

reaching domination by imposing its language and narratives; the political warfare, which refers C
L

to the use of  all means other than war available to a country to achieve its objectives; and the U

Behind the public face of  Chinese influence – the activities of  the media (→ p. 172) P
and of  the diplomats (→ p. 205) primarily – which are analyzed in detail in the following T
part, we found institutional actors whose role and nature need to be understood.1 Their S

diversity, fragmentation, bureaucratic rivalries, and the occasional overlap in their missions 
support the understanding that, contrary to a widespread belief  – generally assumed on 
authoritarian states – “China” is not a unitary actor.2 Numerous observers have indeed 
shown “an excessive propensity to assess the Chinese state according to the single criteria 

A
of  its political regime.”3 But “the nature of  the regime provides above all information on C
the foundations of  its sovereignty and on the routes to power. Yet to build a more truthful T
image of  the Chinese state, we must focus not on the regime but on the state as it consti- O
tutes a political center,”4 in other words, a bureaucracy. To summarize: while the regime is R

S
strong, its political center suffers from a substantial fragmentation. And this fragmenta-
tion can impact the nature of  influence operations carried out by Beijing.5 This is 
why we sought to devote numerous pages to dissecting, as much as possible, the role and 
nature of  the different actors involved in these operations. In other words, before analyzing 
in detail the different actions (Part Three → p. 143), we need to understand who does 
what. As Anne-Marie Brady explained, “CCP political interference activities draw on the A

C
resources of  the Party, the Chinese state, the PLA, and the private sector in China, as well T
as on Chinese companies abroad – what I refer to as the Party-State-Military-Market I
nexus.”6 We will therefore distinguish these four principal categories – Party, state, army, O

companies – and within each one, the agencies, departments and services most involved in N
S

influence operations abroad.

At least five entities within the Party are important actors in influence operations: The P
Propaganda Department, the United Front Work Department, the International Liaison T

S
Department, the Communist Youth League, and the 610 Office.

I. The Propaganda Department
A

The Propaganda/Publicity Department (中央宣传部)1 oversees the ideological work,2 C
T

as much in its conception as in the coordination between the structures that teach it to the O
members of  the Party and diffuse it to the masses.3 It develops the training programs R
for Party members and for the national school curriculum, establishes the propaganda S

policies to be implemented and plays a role in the nomination, promotion, and firing of  
the executives in the bureaucracies that make up the propaganda system. The department 
also controls the entire media spectrum – press, books, radio, television, Internet – to 
which it provides the news items to cover and those not to mention, both for a domestic 
audience and abroad.4 A

As the promoter of  a unified thought, the Propaganda Department controls not only C
T

information but also the entire cultural production of  the country, leaving as little space I
as possible for critique and creativity. With the 2018 reforms, the Party reclaimed certain O
prerogatives previously in the hands of  the state, further reinforcing its control over the N
development of  the Party’s narrative strategies. The Propaganda Department notably inher- S

ited supervisory and regulatory authority over the audiovisual industry,5 allowing the 
Party to promote patriotic movies or those presenting China as a responsible power for 

1. The CCP modified the English translation of  the department’s name to replace propaganda with publicity, C
without changing the Chinese name, xuanchuan 宣传, which refers to communication, diffusion, announcement, public A
declarations. S

2. In Chinese: yishi xintai (意识心态). The expression is commonly translated as “ideology,” but yishi refers to the E
conscience, to being aware of  something, and xintai refers to the state, the mentality. 

3. For further details on the Propaganda Department, see Anne-Marie Brady’s benchmark work, which has 
unfortunately not been updated since its publication: Marketing Dictatorship: Propaganda and Thought Work in Contemporary 
China (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2008). See also David Shambaugh, “China’s Propaganda System: 
Institutions, Processes and Efficacy,” The China Journal, 57 (2007).

D example,6 but also to censor those that do not align with the Party’s vision (→ p. 346).7 This 
U
C department is thus a powerful machine, allowing the Party to shape the dominate dis-
T
I course, control mass media, limit the freedom of  expression and critical thought, 
O
N orient – and manipulate – public opinion, defend its interests, justify its actions, and 

present itself  in the best light. 
Created in 1924, eliminated during the Cultural Revolution, then reestablished in 1977, 

C the Propaganda Department has been given a growing role since Xi Jinping came to power. 
O Its current director, Huang Kunming (黄坤明), is a Politburo members, as his predecessors 
N were, and is close to Xi Jinping with whom he worked for 20 years in Fujian and Zhejiang.8 
C
E The Propaganda Department, whose offices are located at 5 West Chang’an Boulevard (西
P 长安街5号) in Beijing, remains an opaque institution, but it is nevertheless known to employ 
T 200 to 300 employees, all Party members, and to have about ten offices.9 Its budget probably 
S reaches RMB2.5 billion, or €317 million.10

The Propaganda Department is at the heart of  the vast bureaucracy of  the propaganda 
system (宣传系统). At its head are several small leading groups and commissions. The 
Secretariat of  the Party’s Central Committee serves as an intermediary between them and 
the Propaganda Department, whose director is usually a Secretariat member, as is the case 

A
C with the current one.11 The department then serves as an agency coordinating all the bodies 
T in charge of  implementing propaganda.
O The Central Leading Group for Propaganda and Ideology (中央宣传思想工作领导
R
S 小组), formed during the 1980s, is the principal authority elaborating the policy whose 

implementation is coordinated by the Propaganda Department. It is currently run by Wang 
Huning (王沪宁), fifth member of  the Standing Committee of  the Party’s Politburo, with 
Huang Kunming as deputy. In 2018, the Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and 
Informatization was elevated to the rank of  commission (中央网络 安全和信息化
委员会), and it is now presided by Xi Jinping. The Internet being an indispensable plat-

A form for the diffusion of  propaganda, there is no doubt that the Propaganda Department 
C
T follows this commission’s directives. The General Affairs Office of  this commission is, for 
I that matter, run by the deputy director of  the Propaganda Department, Zhuang Rongwen 
O (庄荣文).12 Likewise, the department seems to rely on another central leading group, 
N
S which also became a commission in 2018, on Foreign Affairs (中央外事工作委员会) and 

dealing with questions of  overseas propaganda. The Central Guidance Commission on 
Building “Spiritual Civilization” (中央 精神文明建设指导委员会), similarly presided by 
Wang Huning with Huang Kunming as deputy, can also be mentioned; its office is run by 
the Propaganda Department. These leading groups ensure that the subordinate structures, 
in this case the Propaganda Department, correctly apply the directives passed down from 

C higher Party authorities.

To ensure the implementation of  the Party’s policies on propaganda and ideology, the D
U

department of  the same name exercises direct control or supervision over a broad range of  C

organizations, each with its own means to influence society. The following non-exhaustive T
I

list presents the main ones: O
N

• The General Administration for Press and Publications (国家新闻出版署) imple-
ments propaganda while supervising the entire press and publishing sector. Among other 
things, it manages the content and quality of  publications, printings, royalties, and the C
import of  printed works. O

• The State Council Information Office (国务院新闻办公室) is in actually the same N
structure as the Central Committee’s Foreign Propaganda Office (中央对外宣传办公 C

E
室).13 The deputy director of  the Propaganda Department, Zhuang Rongwen, is also the P
deputy director of  this office. It regularly organizes press conferences, ensures that Chinese T
media correctly present China abroad and accurately “explain” and “narrate” China, but S
also makes sure that foreign news is communicated to the national audience with an angle 
favorable to Party interests.

• The Cyberspace Administration (国家互联网信息办公室), another structure 
with two different names, corresponds to the office of  the Central Leading Group for 
Cybersecurity previously mentioned. Its director is also Zhuang Rongwen, deputy director A

C
of  the Propaganda Department. This administration executes propaganda policy on the T
Internet. O

• The Central Guidance Commission on Building Spiritual Civilization (中央精 R
S

神文明建设指导委员会办公室) is generally managed by the deputy executive director 
(常务副部长) of  the Propaganda Department, currently Wang Xiaohui (王晓晖). The 
Propaganda Department and this commission’s office manage the “Chinese Civilization” 
(中国文明网) portal together, presented as the principal platform for promoting propa-
ganda and “spiritual civilization” efforts;14 the latter refers to the promotion of  the rules of  
good manners, morals, and hygiene for instance. A

• The Foreign Language Publishing Administration (中国外文出版发行事 业局), C
T

also known as the China International Publishing Group (中国国际出版 集团), is the I
largest foreign-language publishing house in China. O

• The Propaganda Department supervises numerous newspapers and press agen- N
S

cies such as the People’s Daily, the bi-monthly Qiushi, the Guangming Daily, or even Xinhua, 
and heads the China Media Group – also called Voice of  China – which brings together 
the major Chinese media outlets like CCTV, China National Radio, and Radio China 
International since 2018.

• The Propaganda Department is known to be influential in institutions such as the 
Ministry of  Culture and of  Tourism, the Academy of  Social Sciences, but also with C
some professional associations such as the Association of  Chinese Writers (中国作家协 A
会) or that of  journalists (中华全国新闻工作者协会). S

• Finally, the Propaganda Department has local ramifications at the provincial, munic- E

ipality, and district levels and extends even to neighborhoods or village committees. Local 
departments have been entrusted with a broad range of  activities including the control of  
newspapers, media, and local cultural associations. They also manage education at their 
level and health policy through anti-epidemic centers and clinics.

C The Propaganda Department therefore manages a vast network of  structures that 
T
I control different vectors of  information capable of  influencing the Chinese and 
O
N overseas populations. The content they spread is the result of  the department’s pro-

paganda policy and must conform to the Party’s ideology. The most commonly used 
method to make known what should be said or omitted is to issue spoken or written 

C instructions. These directives have a presumably higher status than national laws:15 sim-
O ply questioning them is liable to punishments including dismissals, firings (for journalists), 
N closures (for media organizations), and even jail time; instructions can sometimes contain 
C
E threats if  the directives are not carried out.16 Such directives are apparently adopted weekly 
P by groups of  five or six officials within the department and delivered during weekly meet-
T ings with editors in chief  and journalists, followed by phone calls in subsequent days to 
S check in on their implementation.17

The Propaganda Department is at the head of  a system that manipulates the infor-
mation delivered to the Chinese each day, and which now dares to be more aggres-
sive abroad. The importance given to propaganda meant for overseas audiences is growing, 
even as it becomes less and less distinguishable from internal propaganda due to the increas-

A
C ing number of  Chinese able to access news in a foreign language, to the size of  the Chinese 
T diaspora, and to the growing ability of  foreigners to read the Chinese-language press.

II. The United Front Work Department (UFWD)
The United Front Work Department (UFWD) of  the Party’s Central Committee (中

央统一战 线工作部) is the only department that constitutes the bureaucratic embodi-
A ment of  a political concept, as introduced in the preceding section (→ p. 35). Emmanuel 
C Jourda presented the UFWD as “a sort of  permanent secretariat for United Front issues,” 
T although it does not have a monopoly on this political action.18 Since 2017, the UFWD 
I
O has been run by You Quan (尤权), a member of  the CCP’s General Secretariat managed by 
N Wang Huning, who oversees ideological activities and propaganda.19

A Brief  History of  the UFWD T
I

• In 1937, at the beginning of  the anti-Japanese United Front, the CCP sent a delegation to O
Wuhan to manage relations with the KMT; this was the first structural formalization of  the N

United Front.20

• In January 1939, the General Secretariat of  the CCP decided to create a central United Front 
department overseen by Wang Ming (王明) and, in March, ordered to all services, provincial C
committees, and special committees, to create a structure at their level and implement United O
Front efforts.21

N
• From May 1944 to April 1945, the CCP established the Central City Work Department (中 C
央 城市工作部), overseen by Peng Zhen (彭真), who took over leadership of  United Front E
resistance against Japan. It ceased to function after the victory over the Japanese.22

• In April 1946, P
the Central Committee reactivated the Central City Work Department, with 

Zhou Enlai at its head.23 T
S

• In September 1948, the Central Committee renamed it the United Front Work Department. 
Lei Weihan (李维汉) took over management.24

• In 1949, the UFWD contributed to the preparation of  the Chinese People’s Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), set up in June.25

• With the Cultural Revolution, the activities of  the UFWD were interrupted.26

• In July 1968, two PLA officers secretly restored the UFWD.27

• In June 1973, the Central Committee of  the Party officially restarted the UFWD with the A
provisional nomination of  Liu Youfa (刘友法) at its head.28 C
• In 1979, the 14th United Front Work Conference fully reestablished the UFWD structures.29 T
• In March 2018, the reforms launched at Xi Jinping’s instigation resolved the issues of  over- O
lapping responsibilities and lack of  coordination that interfered with the efficiency and im- R
plementation of  the United Front policy. The UFWD notably recovered its authority over S
the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the The National Ethnic Affairs Commission, 
and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. Its authority over attachés and consuls in charge of  
United Front activities aimed at the Chinese diaspora also increased, positioning the Minister 
of  Foreign Affairs in a relatively subordinate position to the UFWD on these questions. 

A
C

The UFWD’s offices highlight United Front targets. Certain among them have long T
existed: in 1948, the young UFWD was already taking an interest in ethnic minorities and in I

O
the Chinese diaspora in KMT-controlled territories.30 With successive reforms, the number N
of  branches grew with the creation of  offices for Xinjiang and the Chinese diaspora, rising S
to nine in 2017 and twelve in 2018. Chinese students abroad have also become an explicit 
target of  the United Front policy.

A Global Network of  “Service Centers”
A

In 2014, the State Council’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (subsequently integrated into C
the UFWD) created “Overseas Chinese Service Centers” (华助中心) with the goal of  setting T
them up in 60 countries. At the end of  2018, it had 45 in 39 countries.31 Their raison d’être is I
the provision of  services to the Chinese community, particularly newly–arrived migrants. For O
the most part, preexisting centers were simply labelled OCSCs. For example, in South Africa, N
13 “Chinese Community and Police Cooperation Centers” in place since 2004 were certified S
as OCSCs. They are tasked with “protecting the lives and property of  individuals of  Chinese 
descent in South Africa by facilitating a more productive relationship with South African po-
lice.”32 In fact, they had long been financed by the Chinese Embassy in South Africa. The 
heads of  this network (currently Li Xinzhu (李新铸), and his predecessor Wu Shaokang (吴
少康)) are two Chinese businessmen who made a career in South Africa, and who also 
head the African branch of  the China Council for the Promotion of  Peaceful National 
Reunification (中国和平统一促进会) – which falls directly under UFWD supervision.

U III. The International Liaison Department
C
T
I The International Liaison Department (ILD, 中共中央对外联络部) is an organ of  
O
N the Central Committee in charge of  the Party’s external work (党的对外工作). This work 

consists in maintaining party-to-party relations, also called “party diplomacy,” and is 
part of  the PRC’s “general diplomacy” (总体外交). A “quiet but effective diplomacy,” to 

C use David Shambaugh’s words,33 the ILD’s activities draw little attention for at least three 
O reasons: when it comes to diplomacy, we think mainly of  the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs; 
N
C because party-to-party relations are not generally considered an important element of  a 
E country’s foreign policy; and because the ILD voluntarily keeps a low profile.34 Its actions 
P are nevertheless not to be overlooked: the ILD has notably served as a parallel diplomatic 
T
S channel to conduct sensitive and secret negotiations, promote the revolution (it has sent 

money and weapons to armed groups abroad), but also to act as a propaganda agent 
which can double as an intelligence collector.35

The ILD is the heir of  several successive institutions: The Communications Office 
(交通局) created in 1927, the Overseas Work Commission (海外工作委员会) which 

A seemingly replaced it in 1942, then the 3rd United Front Bureau which took over the liai-
C son work in 1948.36 In 1951, the International Liaison Department was created, making 
T a break with United Front structures. It took the name “International Department” in its 
O
R English version in 1995, while its Chinese name remained the same.37 Originally, the IDL 
S was in charge of  the relations with other Communist parties worldwide: in the 1950s, it 

took an interest in Asian parties, on the one hand, and on Eastern European and Soviet 
parties on the other. With the 1955 Bandung Conference, the ILD also developed links 
with socialist parties in Africa and the Middle East.38 It was only from the 1980s onward 
that the ILD enlarged its range of  interlocutors to include all types of  parties, whatever 

A their political stripes. The goal of  the ILD indeed evolved: it was no longer a matter of  
C exporting the revolution. This goal was abandoned with the emergence of  the “Three 
T representations” theory under Jiang Zemin – a sort of  Chinese Thermidor – but to 
I contribute to building a global consensus favorable to China.39 The ILD’s current 
O
N four objectives are to maintain relations with foreign political parties; to serve as an 
S analysis and observation platform allowing the Party to better understand the world; 

increase the number of  “Chinese friends” of  all political stripes; and to reinforce 
China’s soft power and discursive power abroad.40

Since Xi Jinping came to power, the Party has affirmed its will to further centralize 
the management of  the general diplomacy and to strengthen a “new phase” (党的对
外工作新局面) of  party diplomacy,41 which entails building a “new type of  political

is meant to allow foreign political parties to “understand and respect Chinese values C

and interests”;43 it serves as a vector to diffuse a positive image and history of  the Party T

N

Based in Beijing, the ILD has been run since 2015 by Song Tao (宋涛), who graduated 
in economics and got some experience within the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and in the 
former central leading group for Foreign Affairs. Internally, the ILD is currently made up C
of  16 bureaus, of  which 8 are geographically specialized in the following regions: South and O
Southeast Asia; Northeast Asia and Indochina; Central Asia and North Africa; Sub-Saharan N
Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean; Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, and the CIS; C

E
North America, Oceania, Northern Europe; Western Europe. ILD attachés are sometimes P
posted in certain embassies – including Washington, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin – with- T
out necessarily declaring themselves as anything other than staff  of  the Ministry of  Foreign S

Affairs.45 The ILD also manages a front organization created in 1981, the Chinese 
People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (中国国际交流友好协会) 
whose Chinese name means “Chinese Association for Friendly International Exchange”; 
a publishing house, “Contemporary World” (当代世界出版社) founded in 1993; and the 
China Center for Contemporary World Studies (当代世界研究中心), a think tank created A

C
in 1994.46 T

The ILD officially maintains relations with over 600 parties or political groups in O
no less than 160 countries or regions.47 David Shambaugh delineates seven types of  R

S
ILD activities: sending Party leaders abroad; receiving party leaders of  foreign countries, 
especially from socialist countries; participating in, or organizing, international conferences 
of  political parties; promoting China’s policies and achievements abroad; contributing to 
the “battle” against Taiwan on the diplomatic scene; working to advance China’s economic 
modernization; and visiting foreign countries to specifically study a subject, such as the 
causes of  the USSR’s collapse.48 Between 1983 and 2003, the ILD might have received A

C
some 4,500 delegations of  foreign political parties for a total of  26,000 individuals and sent T
abroad more than 1,500 delegations for a total of  10,000 participants.49 Since Xi Jinping, I
more than 158 “presentation sessions” (宣介 会) to explain how China “succeeds” have O
been organized worldwide with foreign political figures; more than three-quarters of  them N

S
have taken place since 2016.50 In 2017, the ILD organized a global summit for the first time,

IV. The Communist Youth League 
C The Chinese Communist Youth League (CYL – 中国共产主义青年团) was founded 
O
N in 1920 (before the CCP), under the name Socialist Youth League (社会主义青年 团). 
C Like the Communist Party, it was the product of  three tendencies: it first emerged from the 
E “Western iconoclasm”52 of  the 1910s. One of  the leading figures of  this movement, Chen 
P
T Duxiu (陈独秀), also a founder of  the CCP, attributed the failure of  the 1911 Revolution 
S to the position of  the preceding generation that imagined saving China by employing 

“Chinese knowledge for fundamental principles and Western knowledge for practical 
application” (中学为体,西学为用). For Chen and the intellectuals who founded this 
“movement for the new culture” (Hu Shi (胡适), Li Dazhao (李大钊) and Lu Xun (鲁
迅)), China could only be saved by the adoption of  Western culture. They spread their 

A ideas via the review Xin Qingnian (新青年) (New Youth) – whose sub-heading, La Jeunesse, 
C was written in French – and they enjoyed a rapid success, especially among the youth. Then, 
T
O the CYL emerged from the May Fourth Movement (in 1919), a vast protest movement 
R resulting from the injustice felt by the Chinese youth faced with the Versailles Treaty’s deci-
S sion to attribute the Shandong province (formerly under German domination) to Japan. 

This nationalist convulsion stimulated a germinating intellectual fervor and marked the 
birth of  a form of  activism among the educated youth. Finally, after 1920, the Kommintern 
(created the previous year) sent advisors to China to facilitate the creation of  a Chinese 
section of  the Communist International: first Grigori Voitinsky (born Zarkhin), the deputy 

A director of  the Far East Comintern Bureau, then Hendricus Sneevliet (alias Hans Maring) 
C whose efforts led to the creation of  the CCP and the CYL. The League adopted its current 
T name in 1925.
I
O Like the CCP, the CYL presents significant structural similarities with the Soviet 
N system, in this case the Komsomol. The CYL is a so-called mass organization which serves 
S as a relay for the Party toward a fraction of  the Chinese population. Officially, its role is to 

assist the Party and it also serve as its reserve force (后备军). It is thus designed to serve 
as a go-between with the youth – the CYL ensures the dissemination of  the Party’s key-
words and propaganda –, as an incubator for future Party executives (a quarter of  CCP 
members comes from it53), and to be a mobilizable force if  needed. An ideal arena to 
identify promising leaders, the CYL has long constituted a vehicle of  social promotion for 

C young people. It is nevertheless seen by some today as a decaying structure which no longer 
A
S provides ambitious individuals with significant advantages.54

E The CYL welcomes young individuals between 14 and 28 and it counts slightly more 
than 80 million members (compared to 90 million for the CCP). Around one young Chinese 
in five is a member. It thus represents a colossal force within this age group.

A. Operation and organization D
U
C
T

The operation and organization of  the CYL resemble the CCP’s. It is governed by a char- I
O

ter drafted in 1957. A national congress is held every four years, following the CCP’s and N
whose themes it echoes. The congress traditionally opens with a speech by the Politburo 
member in charge of  CYL relations,55 a symbolic way to remind the participants of  the 
Party’s control and to convey its overall expectations regarding the mass organization. The C
Party also appoints the leaders of  the CYL. The League is run by a first secretary, an execu- O
tive secretary and five secretaries. It has only very limited autonomy in relation to the Party N

C
and no administrative power. It is not able to implement public policies. It is therefore E
above all an organ for mobilizing people and distributing propaganda. Like the Party, P
the CYL has local committees at each level of  the Party-State apparatus, which are under T
the dual supervision of  the higher-level CYL committee and of  the same-level Party com- S

mittee. 
The CYL supervises other Party-affiliated youth organizations: The All-China 

Youth Federation (中华全国青年联合会) – a structure of  the United Youth Front – 
Young Pioneers of  China (中国少年先锋队) – children from 6 to 14 – and the All-China A
Student Federation (中华全国学生联合会56). C

The CYL has its own propaganda tools, including the Chinese Youth Daily (中 T
国青年报57) – relatively liberal and distributed at almost 600,000 copies – and the Chinese O

R
Youth publishing house (中国青年出版社58). The latter has published over 700 mil- S
lion copies of  over 10,000 works since its creation in 1950.59 It also publishes a dozen 
magazines, including Chinese Youth (中国青年) and Youth File (青年文摘), both with over 
3 million copies distributed monthly. In 2007, the CYL publishing house set up shop in 
London. Its London branch (中国青年出版总社伦敦分社 – CYPI PRESS) was ordered 
to set up an international English-language publishing platform (in other languages 
as well) and an international marketing network. It is meant to “present a more genuine, A

C
modern, and beautiful China to the world.”60 The CYL also manages a central school in T
which its leaders are trained. I

Over the past two decades, the CYL has been marked by the rapid development of  its O
N

affiliated structures. It thereby acquired units capable of  acting on its behalf  and has thus S
been able to develop the scope of  its missions. The CYL has furthermore strengthened 
its action regarding universities where it strives to better control students.61 Despite 
these developments the CYL remains a weakly-funded organization with a limited budget 
of  RMB583 million in 2015 (€82.4 million at the time), far behind other mass organizations 
of  the regime.

U B. CYL influence operations
C
T
I Most of  CYL-led influence operations clearly take places on PRC territory. The 
O
N mass organization participates first and foremost in the effort to legitimize the party in the 

eyes of  the Chinese youth, which is why most of  its resources are deployed in China. This 
mission obviously includes a defense against external aggressions. As such, it is useful to 

C remember that between January 21 and 24, 2019, the CCP held a seminar at the Central 
O Party School on risk and stability. In his opening speech on January 21, Xi Jinping underlined 
N
C two essential objectives: the prevention of  major risks and the protection of  economic and 
E social stability. The Party leader thereby urged managers to guard against eventual “black 
P swans” and “gray rhinos” (警惕黑天鹅, 防范灰犀牛)62 to ensure the regime’s political 
T safety.63 The seminar was likely motivated by unrests in Venezuela following the election 
S in early January of  Juan Guaidó as head of  the National Assembly and his contestation of  

President Maduro’s power. These events thereby unearthed the CCP’s fears of  a Chinese 
color revolution presumably encouraged by Washington. Although Xi Jinping had 
alluded to other types of  black swans, linked to technology or finance for example, it is the 

A risk of  a color revolution that haunts the regime. The Party regularly accuses the United 
C States of  encouraging democratic revolutions worldwide and having such ambitions in 
T China. The Party no doubt considered that the notion of  a black swan offered an efficient 
O
R means to remind Party leaders of  the necessity to fight this insidious menace to ensure their 
S monopoly on power.

Interestingly, the WeChat account named “Island of  the Knights” (俠客島) run by China 
Daily and whose name refers to a swashbuckling novel, Ode to Gallantry (俠客行) by Jin 
Yong (金庸), echoed Xi’s 21 January speech, explaining that the ideological fight should be 
carried out online first and that the youth was its primary Internet audience.64 Activities 
targeting the youth are therefore a priority for the survival of  the regime.

A
C To carry out this work, the CYL has significantly increased its presence on social 
T networks, naturally favoring the outlets most popular among young people. A study con-
I ducted by Ma Xiaoxuan and Anna Strelkova,65 shows the extent of  this presence. It also 
O
N shows the overrepresentation of  Bilibili (哔哩哔哩),66 a video-sharing platform which 
S allows for content diffusion along with comments embedded in the videos. The two authors 

explained that this platform’s audience is very young, and belongs to Generation Z. No 
wonder then that the CYL is devoting significant efforts on it.

The CYL uses Bilibili as its vector of  choice for the dissemination of  very diverse nar-
rative materials, but whose general aim remains the promotion of  the Party, the home-
land, and criticisms of  the United States. On the latter, the platform distinguished itself

racism of  the American government (→ p. 387). C

The narratives spread by the CYL on Bilibili, as on other social networks, use rhetorical T
I

tactics to gain the youth’s support, especially humor. The messages disseminated are thus O
N

often sarcastic (→ p. 395). 
To carry out its work, the CYL has also been equipped since 1993, through the newspa-

per of  the communist youth, with a public polling center. Over the years, this center has C
carried out several studies on the attitudes of  young Chinese toward the West. According O
to certain Chinese researchers,67 a study published by the center after the United States N
bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade showed the United States as the most-hated C

E
country among the Chinese youth; it may have influenced Clinton’s China policy. It is not P
possible to establish the robustness of  the survey in question but the case illustrates well T
how the CYL tries to acquire tools to better understand and guide young people. S

The CYL thus plays a key role in the CCP’s propaganda work and provides important 
support to the department of  the same name. While the CYL’s actions aim first and fore-
most at winning over the Chinese youth, turning them into an unfailing Party ally, they also 
look to use young people to distribute narrative material produced by the Party to 
other segments of  the society. A

C
CYL agents have thereby become true experts in the use of  social networks, on the one T

hand, and in the use of  subcultures likely to spread their message, such as rap, on the other. O
On August 4 2016, the Chengdu-based rap group CD Rev (天府事变) uploaded the R

S
song “Watch Out for Color Revolutions” (警惕颜色革命)68 which argued that the 
United States promotes democracy to better impose its power and control over the 
world. The song was in fact a propaganda operation led by the CYL. CD Rev regularly 
collaborates with the CYL whose slogans and narratives are repurposed in its songs.69 
They claim a lineage to American rapper Eminem and they have adopted the codes of  
Gangsta Rap but the content – acting as CCP apologists – brings them far from the spirit A
of  the American rap movement. The imitation of  American codes also contrasts with the C

T
sharp critique of  Washington, incapable of  finding favors with the rappers. “Watch Out for I
Color Revolutions” was met with real success and quickly established itself  as one of  the O
most effective instruments of  the anti-American discourse in the Chinese youth. It N

S
also shows the Party’s capacity to turn American cultural codes against the United States 
themselves.

The CYL was also responsible for uploading, on August 1, 2016, a video that accused 
the United States of  fomenting a color revolution in China, like those in Georgia, 
Ukraine, and the Arab spring.71 The video, uploaded to the Weibo website of  the Supreme 

A People’s Procuratorate, was viewed more than 10 million times in only 24 hours.72 Its 
C publication date, August 1, was not a coincidence, as it was the anniversary of  the PLA’s 
T creation: as its author explained, the video was designed to support the army’s development 
O
R and its deterrent role in the face of  US actions.73 It was made by Lei Xiying (雷希颖), then 
S a doctoral student at the Australian National University. A CYL member, and a particularly 

active member in Australia, he was described by the CCP as “an outstanding youth repre-
sentative of  online ideological construction.”74 His thesis actually dealt with the representa-
tions of  China in Australia’s media. According to his Baidu biography page,75 Lei was born 
in 1987 in Fujian province. Since 2014, he has distinguished himself  in numerous “patri-
otic” activities aimed at uniting the Chinese people behind the Party’s objectives: in 2014, 

A
C he created a commemorative map of  the patriotic war against Japan (抗战爱国纪念地图); 
T in 2015, he produced his first propaganda video entitled “The Engine of  My Country and

I feel truly invested by a mission from the executive committee. I have studied and lived abroad for a 
long time, and I now better understand the Chinese dream. Last year, I launched the event “Share a 
Photo with the National Flag” which sparked the unexpected participation of  hundreds of  millions 
of  Chinese and foreign citizens, and showed that the Chinese dream is the common dream of  hun-
dreds of  millions of  people. As a foreign student, I am looking forward to learning and returning 

C to China as soon as possible. Knowledge contributes to the development of  our mother country.76

In the previously-mentioned video published by the account of  the Supreme People’s 

Procuratorate, Lei Xiying suggested that unrests in the Middle East were the direct result 
of  American interventions and the revolutions they fomented. China was presented as a 
stable and prosperous country under an American threat. The stars and stripes (see the 
screenshot above) was portrayed as lingering behind Tibetan, Uyghur, Hong Kong and A

C
Taiwanese separatists, behind human rights activists, behind attacks against Chinese Blue T
Helmets, and behind the Japanese or Filipino actions in the South China Sea. According to O
this video, the U.S. aims to destroy Chinese harmony by all possible means. It presumably R
practices subversion and attempts to provoke existing tensions within the Chinese society. S

The video played on pathos, showing numerous images of  children and adults, vic-
tims of  the unrest supposedly created by U.S. interventions.79 It was about inflicting 
real “commotion”80 on the audience, hence designed to bend its will and gain support with-
out recourse to the rational logos.81 But this goal remains hidden behind a demonstration 
presented above all as “instructive” and well-argued. The persuasive process was further A
reinforced by an abundance of  evidence (known in Latin rhetoric as copiosus) produced in a C

T
particularly embellished style. I

The different actions carried out by Lei in the name of  the CYL earned him, on May O
4 2017, the May Fourth Medal of  Chinese Youth.82 Lei Xiying was also a contributor to N
the Internet website “April Internet”83 (四月网) whose original name was “Anti-CNN.” S

The website, launched in April 2008 and inaccessible since the end of  2020, was meant to 
counter the “arrogant” discourse “full of  prejudice” coming from the American – and by 
extension Western – media.84 It was the treatment by Western media of  “incidents” in Tibet 
that seemingly motivated the creation of  the website which offered articles that “demol-

command and organization, on its number of  employees, or even on its modus operandi.

meeting of  the Party’s Politburo to take measures against the dramatic rise in power of  the D
U

Falun Gong movement within the Chinese society.88 Their activities of  spiritual gymnastics C

were bringing together tens of  thousands of  practitioners, including at the highest levels T
I

of  the CCP. Jiang Zemin saw a threat to the survival of  the Party, unable to tolerate the O
N

existence of  a social structure outside of  its control.89 Following the meeting, a directive 
established a small leading group directly connected to the Central Committee of  the Party 
and under the leadership of  Li Lanqing (李岚清), a Politburo member in charge of  solving C
the Falun Gong “problem.” On June 10, the 610 Office (whose name reflects its date of  O
creation) was created to implement the directives formulated by the central leading group. N
No text appears to have been promulgated on the 610 Office and it literally remains an C

E
extra-legal structure. P

In the months following the Party’s decision, the 610 Office opened branches at all T
levels of  the Party-State to structure a tight network throughout the territory. At each S
level, the local 610 Office director also occupies the role of  secretary or deputy secretary 
of  the Political-Legal Affairs Committee (政法委) of  the same level.90 The Party also cre-
ated Maintaining Stability Offices (维稳办公室), especially in major coastal cities, which 
appear to work in close collaboration with local sections of  the 610 Office and often share 
the same physical premises.91 According to the Epoch Times – whose reporting should be A

C
approached with the utmost caution – in March 2010, the government of  the Pingyang T
District, in Zhejiang Province, apparently announced the nomination of  only one manager O
at the head of  the local offices of  the two administrations, thus proving their integration R

S
and common objectives. The 610 Office employs around 15,000 individuals across all 
Chinese and overseas territories. The agents of  this “administration” act without any 
legal basis to eradicate the Falun Gong movement.

We know more about this office, especially about its overseas activities, since the 
defection of  Chen Yonglin in 2005, who was then a consul in Sydney and in charge of  
Falun Gong. In July 2005, he described in detail Beijing’s practices for detecting, surveil- A
ling, and persecuting Falun Gong followers worldwide before a House sub-committee in C

T
Washington.92 He explained that following the creation of  the 610 Office, the Chinese I
Minister of  Foreign Affairs put in place an office on the Falun Gong question connected O
to the national measures taken to fight the “cult.” In 2004, this service took the name of  N

S
the Department of  External Security Affairs. In February 2001, the Chinese consulate in 
Sydney created a special group in charge of  the fight against Falun Gong. The group was 
run by the Consul General himself  and convened twice a month.

According to the diplomat, similar groups were created in the United States and countries 
where the cult was active.93 “The war against the Falun Gong was extended abroad in 2000. 
In each Chinese diplomatic mission, there had to be at least one official responsible C
for the Falun Gong issue,” explained Chen Yonglin, who occupied this precise position A
in Sydney, and whose mission was to “monitor and persecute” Falun Gong members in S

and repression against the followers are accompanied by significant propaganda aimed 
at foreign governments, elected officials, media, universities, etc. to convince them of  

C the legitimacy of  Chinese actions and of  the harmfulness of  the Falun Gong. Diplomats 
O are also tasked with detecting and keeping a record on its members, adding them to a 
N blacklist that prevents them from returning to China. The Chinese authorities also try to 
C
E reduce the broadcasting and circulation of  media outlets created by the Falun Gong such 
P as New Tang Dynasty Television – today called NTD – and they finance the broadcast of  
T anti-Falun Gong radio and television shows. Finally, local relays of  the 610 Office, as with 
S other Party-State actors, rely on the Chinese diasporas in the West to muffle Falun Gong 

activities. Universities likely to support CCP actions are encouraged to take a public posi-
tion against the cult.

Even if  the 610 Office is not a leading actor in Chinese influence operations, its activities 
in countries with numerous Falun Gong followers constitutes a real interference.

THE STATE I
O
N

C
O
N
C
E

Within the state, two structures in particular are involved in influence operations: the P
Ministry of  State Security and the Taiwan Affairs Office. T

S

I. The Ministry of  State Security
In this assessment of  the actors involved in Chinese operations, the Ministry of  State A

Security (MSS C
中华人民共和国国家安全部), the principal civil intelligence agency, T

has two singularities: first, it is the most difficult institution to investigate with open source O
methods. If  our research into the Chinese-speaking Internet allowed us to collect numer- R
ous details about the United Front, the Taiwan Affairs Office or even the PLA – all of  them S

leave documents online containing valuable information – the MSS appears to be much 
more careful. Little information is thus openly available. Second, information manipulation 
does not appear to figure among the MSS’s primary missions. To this day, no organization 
dedicated to these questions (modeled on the KGB’s Service A) has been identified within 
the Chinese agency. A

The MSS was founded on July 1, 1983. It resulted from the fusion of  the Central C
T

Investigation Department (CID, 中共中央调查部) – an intelligence service created in I
1955 and placed under the direct leadership of  the Central Committee of  the Party – with O
the first office of  the Ministry of  Public Security (MPS, 公安部) in charge of  counter-es- N
pionage (反间谍), generally called the Political Security Bureau ( S

政治保卫局) –, probably 
the second and third offices of  the MPS, and finally several units of  the United Front Work 
Department (统战部) as well as the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry 
for National Defense (国防科工委). The deputy director of  the MPS, Ling Yun (凌云)1 
became the first Minister of  State Security.

Several factors may have hung over the MSS’s creation and led to the decision to place 
this new service under the supervision of  the State Council instead of  the Party’s Central C

A
Committee. The creation of  the MSS first made it possible to eliminate the CID, whose S
head, Luo Qingchang (罗青长) was opposed to Deng’s rise to power – he had endorsed E
Hua Guofeng (华国锋). Meanwhile, it was an opportunity to reduce the influence of  the 
2PLA, a branch of  military intelligence, on the CID.2 Other reasons also deserve mention: 
the MSS was tasked with developing operations under a non-diplomatic cover, an evolution 

1. His real name is Wu Peilin (吴沛霖). After he joined the Yan’an base in 1939, Ling Yun entered the first C
intelligence service of  the CCP, which was euphemistically named the Central Department of  Social Affairs ( O

中央社 N
会 部), and run by Kang Sheng (康生). C

U
C Mao.3 The transformation of  China’s international and security environment at the end of  
T
I the 1970s and the beginning of  the 1980s could also explain the creation of  the MSS.4
O
N Officially placed under the supervision of  the State Council, the work of  the MSS is 

nevertheless overseen by two important commissions: The Commission for Political-Legal 
Affairs (政法委员会) – which supervises actors charged with implementing the law – and 

C the Central National Security Commission (中央国家安全委员会), created at the 3rd ple-
O nary session of  the 18th Party Congress in 2013 to strengthen the coherence of  the CCP’s 
N security apparatus.
C
E The MSS’s structure is only superficially known and numerous interrogations 
P remain as to the actual functions of  its constituent offices. The MSS has 17 or 18 bureaus/
T divisions to which must be added the affiliated bodies (see infographics). Furthermore, all 
S the bureaus/divisions have at their disposal front organizations to carry out operations 

abroad. For example, the 4th Division uses the cover of  the Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Macau Office of  the Bureau of  International Cooperation Chinese Academy of  Sciences 
(港澳台办公室----中国科学院国际合作局). As for the 14th Division, it could be able to 
instrumentalize the CAS’s Institute of  Sciences and Development (中国科学院科技战 略

A
C 咨询研究院). The National Society of  Taiwan Studies (全国台湾研究会) is also, accord-
T ing to certain sources,5 a body answerable to the MSS and used both to gather intelligence 
O and as a front organization. MSS agents can also take advantage of  the covers offered by 
R
S different public agencies such as the Xinhua and China News Service press agencies and the 

CITS travel agency (中国国际旅行社).6 The 17th Division supervises the activities of  several 
companies, including the Beijing Yanshan Hotel (北京 燕山大酒店), which serve as façades 
during intelligence operations.

U II. Taiwan Affairs Office
C
T
I The Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) is also involved in influence operations, although they 
O
N do not constitute the heart of  its activities. As is often the case in the Chinese bureaucracy, 

it is a dual body: at once the Taiwan Affairs Office of  the State Council (国务院台湾事务
办公室) and the Taiwan Work Office of  the CPC Central Committee (中共中央台湾工作

C 办公室). The current director of  this two-faced body is Liu Jieyi (刘结一), who used to be 
O a deputy director of  the Central Committee’s Liaison Department. The current minister of  
N
C Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi (王毅), held the position between 2008 and 2013.
E Created in 1988, the office implements the policy of  the Party’s Central Committee 
P vis-à-vis Taiwan. This is largely formulated by the CCP Central Leading Small Group for 
T
S Taiwan Affairs (中央对台工作领导小组), now overseen by Xi Jinping with Wang Yang (汪

洋) as deputy. As a coordinating agency, the TAO guides and inspects all central and territorial 
levels (autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions) organizations 
of  the Party-State in their management of  Taiwan affairs (对台工作).7

The TAO serves as the permanent secretariat for a broad range of  policies linked to 
A Taiwan. Cross-strait exchanges in all fields (culture, education, science, film, publishing, sports, 
C health…) are organized, managed, and coordinated by the Exchanges Office of  the TAO. 
T The Economic Office coordinates economic questions, studies investment policies coming 
O
R from or dedicated to Taiwan, but also manages the different cross-strait flows – land-based, 
S maritime, and electronic. The Research Office follows and studies the evolution of  the situa-

tion in Taiwan, the development of  cross-strait relations, the policies vis-à-vis Taiwan and all 
the other major subjects concerning the island. The Liaison Office is responsible for welcom-
ing important Taiwanese organizations and experts and operates as a liaison between all the 
actors involved. The TAO also coordinates all legal issues concerning Taiwan, manages the 

A preparatory work for any negotiation or treaty signing with Taiwanese authorities and takes 
C general responsibility for the management of  any major event involving Taiwan.8
T More particularly, the TAO oversees propaganda bound to Taiwan. Its Information 
I Office plays an important role in this regard to the extent that it organizes the TAO’s press 
O
N conference, deals with Taiwanese journalists coming to China, manages cross-strait infor-
S mation cooperation, and trains the different local departments and echelons on questions 

related to Taiwan.9 The TAO also has a website used to circulate information addressed 
to the “Taiwanese compatriots” (台湾同胞) who might wish to invest, start a business, 
study, travel, or live in mainland China.10 The website finally relays news concerning the 
PRC’s policies vis-à-vis Taiwan and the development of  cross-strait relations.

The TAO oversees different media outlets – via the Jiuzhou Center for Cultural 
C Communication (九州文化传播中心)11 – such as the audiovisual company Jiuzhou (九
A 洲音像出版公 司), the Jiuzhou Publishing House (九州出版社有限公司), the Relations

THE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY I
O
N

C
O
N
C
E

The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is not the country’s armed forces but the armed P
wing of  the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). As such, it participates in influence opera- T

S
tions, a series of  political maneuvers the CCP considers as part of  its “political warfare” (政
治战). Political warfare is defined as the repertoire of  maneuvers seeking to influence emotions, 
motives, objective reasoning, and the behavior of  foreign governments, organizations, groups, 
and individuals (→ p. 33).1 The PLA’s role in the CCP’s political warfare is based on the Gutian 
Conference resolution of  December 1929, also known as “On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the A
Party.” In it, Mao criticized the “purely military viewpoint” of  Zhu De: C

T
They think that the task of  the Red Army like that of  the White army, is merely to fight. They do not O
understand that the Chinese Red Army is an armed body for carrying out the political tasks of  the revo- R
lution. Especially at present, the Red Army should certainly not confine itself  to fighting; besides fighting S
to destroy the enemy’s military strength, it should shoulder such important tasks as doing propaganda 
among the masses, organizing the masses, arming them, helping them to establish revolutionary political 
power and setting up Party organizations. The Red Army fights not merely for the sake of  fighting but 
in order to conduct propaganda among the masses, organize them, arm them, and help them to establish 
revolutionary political power.2 

Hence, the PLA plays a key role in creating the CCP’s political power. It is within this A
C

conceptual framework that influence operations (and information operations in particular), T
must be understood. They are one of  the PLA’s tools in asserting political power. I

There is perhaps more public data available on the PLA than on any of  the actors O
mentioned so far. The research conducted for this report, as well as for previous studies, N

S
show that it is possible to recover significant amounts of  information from the Chinese-
speaking Internet.

O for 2PLA, signals intelligence (SIGINT) for 3PLA, as well as electronic warfare (EW) and 
N electronic intelligence (ELINT).4

S II. The PLA after the reform

The 2015 military reforms5 restructured the four general departments of  the PLA, 
including the General Political Department, into fifteen departments, all under the 
direct authority of  the Central Military Commission (CMC). Some of  the missions 

A of  the former GPD/LD were given to the Liaison Department of  the new Political 
C Work Department (PWD/LD). The new Joint Staff  Department of  the Central Military 
T
O Commission was tasked with human intelligence. The role of  the two aforementioned 
R institutions in influence operations is not studied in the report due to a lack of  sources. 
S Furthermore, a new branch of  the PLA was created following the reforms: The Strategic 

Support Force (PLASSF) (解放军战略支援部队). This unit took over the cyber, elec-
tronic and spatial warfare domains, hence inheriting from 3PLA and 4PLA. The PLASSF 
may also have acquired part of  the former 2PLA’s technical competencies, though most 
of  the human intelligence missions were transferred to the Joint Staff  Department of  the 

A Central Military Commission (中央军委联合参谋部), and perhaps parts of  the missions 
C of  the former LD/GPD as well.
T In addition to the four traditional administrative departments (General Staff, Equipment, 
I
O Political Work, and Logistics), the PLASSF has a Network Systems Department (网络系统
N 部) and a Space Systems Department (航天系统部). The Network Systems Department, 
S formerly supervised by Commander Ju Qiansheng (巨乾生)6 and Political Commissar Ding 

Xingnong (丁兴农)7 (2019-2021) is said to have inherited certain missions and respon-
sibilities in the information domain, on top of  the cyber and electromagnetic domains.8

The PLASSF is a service (军种), along with the Army, Air Force, Navy, and the new D
U

Rocket Forces. It benefits from a rank equivalent to a theater command (正战区级), which C

is the highest rank beneath the Central Military Commission (CMC).9 Since 2021, the posi- T

tion of  SSF commander has been held by General Ju Qiansheng (巨乾生),10 the previous O

III. Base 311 P
T
S

PLA Unit 61716, also known as the 
“Public Opinion Warfare, Psychological 
Warfare and Legal Warfare Base” (舆论
战心理战法律战基地), or Base 311, was 
created in 2005 in Fujian. The operational A
starting date, unavailable in public records, C
could be deduced from the date when the T

O
first known commanders and political com- R
missars of  this base took office. Before the S
2015 military reforms, the Base 311 was 
part of  the General Political Department 
Liaison Department (GPD/LD) (→ p. 87). 

After the reforms, Base 311 may have been integrated into the PLA’s Strategic Support 
Force (PLASSF), based on the reassignment of  some of  its personnel.13 Its place within A
the PLASSF internal structure remains unknown however. There are two plausible hypoth- C
eses: Base 311 could be attached to the PLASSF’s Political Department or to the Network T
Systems Department. Besides, the base is assumed to have a rank comparable to a deputy I

O
corps command (副军职), meaning it is led by a major general or a senior colonel. According N

public pool (“the Dolphins’ Pool”) however, which was mentioned on a few Internet web- C

sites as being at 77 Meizhu Street as well;20 it was seemingly confirmed by the presence of  T

“pool” sign at the site’s entrance (Image 2). Furthermore, a picture from inside the building O
N

(Image 3) shows a roof  that seems to correspond to the building on the satellite view of  
the neighborhood (Image 4). If  77 Meizhu Street is the address of  a pool, but also listed

that the base is actually elsewhere. And yet, a careful analysis of  the satellite pictures of  the O
immediate environment of  the pool shows a site several dozens of  meters to the north that N
resembles a military site (Image 5). Several details reinforce this hypothesis: the inexistence C

of  the Street View option on Baidu Maps for the entire perimeter (it stops at the supposed P
entrance of  the base, see Image 6); and the presence of  several vehicles – apparently mil- T
itary vehicles – in the courtyard of  one of  the buildings with, at its center, the shadow of  S
what could be a flag pole (Image 7). Last but not least, the site is just around the corner

D Despite a limited understanding of  the Base’s internal structure, which remains extremely

C opaque, it is possible to gather information on the individuals in leadership positions. No 
T
I official data is available, but the triangulation of  information from various online sources 
O
N gives us a partial picture. Like in all PLA units, there is a dual management. At Base 311, 

a commander and a political commissar (traditionally a major general or senior colo-
nel) form an executive duo, usually for a four- or five-year term. The first duo was made 

C of  Commander Deng Changyu (邓长宇) and Political Commissar Song Haihang (宋海
O 航), and served from 2005 to 2010/2011. They were followed by Wang Shu (王树), alias 
N Wang Shu (汪澍) and the Political Commissar Yin Hongwen (尹洪文), who served until 
C
E 2014/2015. Afterwards, Commander Yue Lei (岳雷), alias Qiu Yu (邱雨), and Political 
P Commissar Mei Huabo (梅华波) were appointed.23 A new duo should soon be appointed 
T to Base 311 – or may already have taken command without having been officially revealed.
S Unsurprisingly, the Chinese Internet provides little information on the background of  

these officers, even though most high-ranking PLA officials have a Baidu page outlining their 
professional trajectories. Except for Yue Lei, all of  the aforementioned individuals have a 
Baidu page that only provides meager biographical facts. For example, Major General Deng 
Changyu, who was born in 1954 in Shandong, served as deputy political commissar in the 

A
C Lanzhou military region, then as the secretary of  the political department of  the Lanzhou 
T military region. He then commanded a unit attached to the General Political Department, 
O which likely corresponds to Base 311, and is since thought to have returned to Xinjiang.24 
R
S The most detailed Baidu page is that of  Major General Song Haihang, born in 1955 in 

Henan. It describes all of  the positions he held between 1969 and 2015, including political 
commissar for the Public Opinion Warfare, Psychological Warfare, and Legal Warfare Base 
of  the PLA’s General Political Department (Base 311) between 2005 and 2011.25 Song was 
also the president of  the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC), a front organi-
zation for Base 311 (→ p. 103).26 Likewise, Major General Wang Shu’s Baidu page explains 

A that he was born in 1958 in Hebei and graduated from PLA Nanjing Political College (中
C
T 国人民解放军南京政治学院). Besides his position as commander at Base 311, he was 
I the political commissar for the PLA National Defense University and a PLA delegate at the 
O 12th and 13th sessions of  the National People’s Congress.27 On the contrary, Major General 
N
S Yin Hongwen’s Baidu page does not mention his affiliation to Base 311.28 Finally, the Baidu 

page of  Major General Mei Huabo, which mentions an affiliation to a certain unit of  the 
PLA’s PLASSF (to avoid mentioning Base 311), adds that he used to be the political com-
missar for Chinese Air Force Airborne Academy (中国人民解放军空军空降兵学院).29

Research conducted for this study revealed that Qiu Yu, president of  
CHBC, is in fact the MG Yue Lei, the last identifiable commander at 
Base 311. Base 311 operates through façade civilian companies, 
notably the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC). All 
commanders of  Base 311 were also president of  CHBC during their 
tenure. Using an alias allowed these officers to have their face publicly A

tone, and are written almost identically.32 Yet, and although the Pinyin spelling is the same, 
the difference in Chinese characters is enough to complicate any online search. 

Regarding Wang Shu’s successor, prior research33 was only able to determine that a Qiu 
Yu (邱雨) became the president of  CHBC in 201534 but it could not confirm the real name 
of  the Base 311 commander. We did manage to find his real identity, or at least to propose C

2. An outline of  the internal structure D
U
C

While the Chinese government does not provide any details on the internal structure of  T
I

PLA bases, it is possible to determine part of  Base 311’s structure using open source O

data. The majority of  the following information was gathered from online articles written N

by individuals affiliated with the units in question. Most of  these articles were referenced 
in the Chinese database CNKI (中国知网) and the content often available on the platform 
iXueshu (爱学术). Accessing the articles often provides the name of  the organization the C

O
author was affiliated with. Sometimes an official position was specified, and on rare occa- N
sions some biographical details as well – like the date of  birth, province of  origin, type of  C
diploma, and research interests. By perusing Unit 61716’s CNKI page, a number of  mem- E

P
bers attached to the unit were identified. Hence, we were able to piece together, albeit in an T
incomplete manner, Base 311’s internal structure. S

At the very least, Base 311 has the following bodies: A Political Department (政治

the majority of  the PLA’s units have the same four departments, that Base 311 also contains O
Staff  and Logistics departments. Additionally, the remainder of  Unit 61716 appears to be R
divided into sub-units (分队). If  we couldn’t determine their exact number and functions, S

nine were identified: sub-units 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 61, 64, and 66.42 A number of  them have 
the same address as Base 311: 77 Meizhu Street.43 It is likely that others do as well. It is 
difficult to conclusively ascertain the mission of  each sub-unit, but a number of  published 
public tenders point at their subject areas, such as video surveillance and network security.

artificial intelligence to win the public opinion warfare on the Internet (网络舆论斗争), D
U

sometimes also known as the “consensus war.” They considered that AI could lead to C

a presumably intelligent way to move public opinion.46 This article was signed by Hu T
I

Huaping, affiliated to Unit 61716 and previously a member of  Unit 61070 (a subordinate O
N

unit to Base 311), and by two members of  Huaqiao University, which is under the direct 
supervision of  the United Front Work Department.47 Altogether, three key findings were 
drawn from the articles published by Base 311 affiliates. C

• Firstly, the articles pointed at Base 311’s interest in information and communication O
technologies. Almost all the engineers identified as members of  the base researched N

C
network communication or communications security. E
• Secondly, information and communication technologies must be wielded in service P

T
of  public opinion warfare. This war is waged on all platforms, notably on the Internet, S
social media, and via the “new media.”
• Thirdly, the purpose of  public opinion warfare is to persuade and rally the popula-
tion around Beijing’s narratives, especially in Taiwan.

To implement the “Three Warfares,” Base 311 uses three types of  organizations: A
C

front media companies, subordinate PLA units, and relaying platforms with which T
the links are more distended and blurry. Together, they form a sprawling web, difficult to O
untangle and analyze from the outside. R

S
The front media companies are civilian organizations unofficially controlled by 

Base 311. They allow the Base to operate publicly while remaining in the shadows. We 
have already mentioned Voice of  the Strait (VTS) and China Huayi Broadcasting 
Corporation (CHBC). They were both former PLA radio stations, and are presently mul-
tichannel media targeting the Taiwanese population. Our research found a third front-com-
pany: The Haifeng Publishing House. All of  these companies are potentially able to A

C
influence populations through radio and television channels, the Internet, social T
media, and books. I

Multiple PLA units were discovered to be subordinates, or affiliates, of  Base 311, such O
as Units 61070 and 61198. Their official missions and activities are unknown, but it is pos- N

S
sible to identify their members and sometimes access their published articles. We can then 
piece together the units’ areas of  focus.

A group of  platforms, such as the China Association for International Friendly 
Contact (CAIFC, 中国国际友好联络会) operate in the orbit of  Base 311. These plat-
forms, many of  which have former PLA members as executives, serve as relays for the Base 
311’s operations. By examining these three types of  organizations, we can outline the base’s C
activities, interests, and priorities. A

B. VTS and CHBC: Two PLA media outlets used to influence Taiwan

A Voice of  the Strait Broadcasting Station (VTS, 海峡之声广播电台) and China 
C Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC, 中国华艺广播公司) are actually cover 
T
I names for two PLA units. Evidence of  this fact is easily traced online. The Fujian 
O frontline broadcasting station (中国人民解放军福建前线广播电台) was created in 
N 1958 in Xiamen, by the Fujian province Party committee and the Fuzhou military 
S region. In 1984 its name was changed to Voice of  the Strait.49 CHBC was originally 

a subordinate station of  the Fujian frontline broadcasting station.50 On November 
1, 1991, it officially became China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation, creating another 
public front organization for the PLA.

VTS and CHBC are both PLA units tasked with “communication toward Taiwan” 
(对台广播), and whose ultimate goal is its reunification with mainland China. They 

C
A began as simple radio stations before evolving to more diverse methods of  communica-
S tion, seeking to reach the widest possible number of  Taiwanese. After the creation of  their

tools, such as text, audio, image, video, and social media, to achieve their goals. In an effort C

Two sides of  the same coin, CHBC and VTS apparently share the same offices in A
Fuzhou. They are located at 15 Yuandang Street, in a building nicknamed “the Building C
of  the Strait” ( T

海峡大楼), likely in reference to its inhabitants. Also, the unit behind I
VTS seems to have obtained a rank equivalent to that of  a division (正师级).51 We O
found in the report of  a lawsuit against VTS and CHBC that CHBC is still administra- N
tively subordinate to VTS. Yet, its exact rank is unknown. Consequently, it is plausible S

that the PLA unit behind CHBC holds a rank equivalent to that of  a deputy head of  
division.

1. Voice of  the Strait (VTS)

The Fujian frontline broadcasting station, known as Voice of  Strait (VTS) since 1984, C
was created during the Chinese attack on the Kinmen Islands. Initially under the authority A

S
of  the PLA’s former General Political Department, it sought to support the offensive.52 E
This 1958 military operation marked the beginning of  the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, 
a continuation of  the Communist China’s attempt at retaking Taiwan from the nation-

D alists. In August 1964, VTS officially received an official military designation.53 With the 
U
C 2015 PLA reforms, and the dissolution of  the former General Political Department, it is 
T
I difficult to ascertain who has authority over VTS at the moment. What is certain is that 
O
N Base 311 has been responsible for centralizing all psychological warfare activities against 

Taiwan since 2011. It is also assumed that the base participates in the development of  
VTS programs.54 Consequently, it is plausible that VTS now falls under the authority 

C of  Base 311.
O Since 2016, commander Ran Jiye (冉继业) and political commissar Wang Shuangyang 
N (王双阳) have led VTS. Wang Shuangyang has been affiliated to Unit 61716 (hence to 
C
E Base 311) since at least 2013.55 As for Ran Jiye, he worked as a political commissar 
P at VTS under the previous commander, Zhong Zhigang (钟志刚).56 Because Ran and 
T Zhong were announced as the new heads of  Unit 61023 in 2016, it is possible that VTS 
S is Unit 61023.57 Unit 61023 is actually registered at the same address as VTS.58 Yet, 61985 

is also tied to VTS. Its former general manager, Liu Linlan (柳林岚), was identified as 
the commander of  Unit 61985 in 2013.59 For that reason, Stokes and Hsiao defended 
that VTS’s designation might be Unit 61985.60 According to them, Unit 61023 overseas 
the editorial (编辑部) and technical (技术部) departments and it presumably maintains 

A
C an office in Beijing (北京記者站).61 As such, either both MUCDs are tied to VTS, or 
T a new designation was issued in recent years. Further research also suggested that VTS

Like VTS, CHBC was initially a radio station, and it remains one. According to the O
CHBC website, its radio programs are still accessible in Fuzhou (headquarter of  Base 311), R
and in a handful of  other cities in Fujian province like Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou. S

The programs are also available in the Taiwanese cities of  Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Alishan. 
Other cities where the station broadcasts include Beijing, Shanghai, and foreign cities such 
as Bangkok and Toronto. CHBC’s geographical range shows that it targets Chinese citizens, 
both in mainland China and abroad, as much as the Taiwanese population. CHBC radio 
programs are even available online since the development of  its website in 2009.68 Within A
a few years, CHBC has become, like VTS, far more than a simple radio station. It C
is now a multichannel company that produces podcasts and news reports, runs T

I
forums and is available on social media platforms. One of  its members wrote in 2009 O
that CHBC was a successful example of  the integration of  the “new media” as CHBC was N

61716.80 His promotion in 2018 from deputy chief  executive (副总经理)81 to chief  exec- D
U

utive (执行董事)82 at CHBC likely reflects a promotion inside Base 311 as well. An article C

he wrote in 2015, which is freely accessible online, examined the US psychological warfare. T
I

It was commissioned by the Liaison Department of  the General Political Department and O
N

published in the PLA’s Review of  Theoretical Study of  Political Work.83 In it, Chen Guojun ana-
lyzed the evolution of  the US doctrine, showing how psychological warfare had become 
a crucial component of  its information warfare. In fact, these psychological operations C
were referred to as “support to military intelligence” for a few years. According to Chen, O
information should then be exploited as a weapon. He also pointed at the pre-eminent role N
of  the Air Force in this type of  warfare, focusing first on the dissuasive effects of  military C

E
demonstrations, and then on the possibility of  using aircrafts as means of  communica- P
tion (which has been illustrated by the numerous intrusions in Taiwan’s air defense identi- T
fication zone). Chen’s interest in the US, along with others, highlights the PLA’s perception S

of  the US as the primary practitioner of  psychological warfare, as well as its desire to avoid 
falling behind.

Ai Songru (艾松如), also known as Ai Ke (艾克), is another officer who served at A
CHBC for almost a decade and took a particular interest in psychological warfare. He C
has been the legal representative of  the CHBC’s Television Center since 2010, and he has T

concurrently served as CHBC managing director and chief  executive (执行董事兼总经 O

sumably left CHBC, after nearly eight years serving there as the last trace of  his name, in 
association with CHBC, was in 2017.

His publications indicate he is a specialist in psychological warfare. He co-wrote a book 
about the use of  psychological warfare during the Iraq War, in which he laid out the strat-
egies on the Americans and Iraqis, as well as the role of  communication technologies. The

D public opinion warfare.88 In it, the United States is painted as a key player in psycho-
U
C logical warfare. Ai Songru’s publications showed that the Chinese are studying and 
T
I learning everything they can from the latest wars in which the US was involved.89 
O
N In an article about the War in Kosovo, Ai Songru concluded that “in future conflicts, the 

enemy will use all possible methods, including propaganda and starting rumors to initiate 
psychological warfare.” Consequently “we must be prepared to enact counter-propaganda 

C and more importantly to strengthen our internal communication system during times of  
O war to keep the initiative.90”
N Ai Songru stated in another article that the soldiers of  the Taiwanese Army were pro-
C
E foundly unsettled when Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) took power in 2000.91 He was the first 
P president from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and his pres-
T idency ended decades of  Kuomintang (KMT) governments. According to Ai Songru, 
S Taiwanese soldiers, the majority of  whom were against Taiwan’s independence, no longer 

knew “who or what they [were] fighting for” after the DPP took power (不知为谁而战, 
为何而战), an idea espoused by others, including Zhong Zhigang (→ p. 430). Ai Songru 
painted a picture of  confused and fearful Taiwanese soldiers. Their confusion sup-
posedly stemmed from the removal of  the “anti-independence education” in the army and 

A
C from the split between those who supported reunification and those against it, which then 
T divided, even paralyzed the army, according to the author. They remained fearful of  a real 
O confrontation with the PLA, which they saw as a superior force. They ultimately doubted 
R
S the abilities of  the Taiwanese Army against mainland China and did not want to be the 

“first sacrificed.” Songru believed that the DPP’s political tenure had altered the Army’s 
“political mentality” (政治心态), as it had become more confused, more complicated, and 
as a result, more difficult to control.

Base 311. Although established in 1993, the publishing house did not immediately become 
a front for Base 311. Its affiliation began either in 2005, when the base was created, or in 
the early 2010s, when the base became the central organ for psychological warfare against 
Taiwan.

U 1. The directors of  Haifeng
C
T
I The former director, Jiao Honghui appeared to be a photographer.98 His work as a pho-
O tographer was easily traced, notably in a twenty-minute YouTube video posted by China 
N Southeast TV in November 2018, in which he showcased his work on the preservation 

of  the traditional Hakka culture.99 A number of  articles on his work for the Haifeng pub-
lishing house could also be found. It includes the “Cross-Strait Photographers – Cross-

C
O Strait Tour” (两岸摄影家·两岸行) project, which has brought together photographers 
N from Taiwan and China since 2002 in joint trips to capture and showcase the richness 
C of  the Chinese culture.100 Further inquiries showed that someone named Jiao Honghui 
E
P – presumably the same person – is a military officer and member of  the CCP, who 
T graduated in economics and management from the Central Party School of  the 
S CCP and was a PLA delegate for the 11th session of  the Nation People’s Congress.101 

He was director of  Haifeng since at least 2010,102 but likely worked there since the early 
2000s. But Jiao is thought to have left his posting around 2014, when Fu Guoqiang (傅
国强) was first identified as the new director. Since then, Jiao Honghui has been deputy 
president of  the Photographers’ Association of  Fujian (福建省摄影家协会)103 and has 

A repeatedly participated in the publishing house’s projects.104 In fact, the latest version of  
C
T Haifeng’s Tianyancha profile, in December 2019, listed him as the legal representative of  
O the publishing house.
R Little information is available on his successor, Fu Guoqiang. Born in 1964, Fu studied 
S communication and specialized in “radio” (无线电共专业) before studying literature, 

and becoming the director of  Haifeng around 2014.105 Someone named Fu Guoqiang 
was however affiliated with the Assembly and Inspection Office (装检所) of  the PLA 
ballistic force, located in Baoji, in Shaanxi – but namesakes are common in Chinese, and 
for lack of  sufficient evidence, we cannot say for certain that this is the same person.106

Unit 61070 is located a few buildings down from Base 311, at 3 Meifeng Street.115 It has 
been identified as a Center for Network Propaganda for Base 311 (311基地网络中心), 
and its director was Zhu Leiming (朱磊明) in 2009.116 According to Stokes and Hsiao, in 
addition to leveraging the Internet for propaganda, the unit may have launched cyber-op- A

C
erations.117 The research of  Professor Hu Huaping (胡华平), whois apparently affiliated T
to this unit, supports this hypothesis. Born in 1967, he was the chief  engineer (总工) of  I
Unit 61070 between 2007 and 2017. His articles described his expertise in information O

N
network security, cryptography, and communication networks.118 Known for his participa- S
tion in multiple national research projects, like the 863 Program, he won second prize at 
the National Science and Technology Award from the State Council, and first prize at the 
Military and Technology Progress Award.119

His publications available in open source showed that his research led to the develop-
ment of  a full text retrieval system aimed at improving the detection of  relevant content

nage activities and is connected to foreign universities and private companies in the defense 

A
C sector. Hu Huaping has also collaborated with colleagues at the Huazhong University 
T of  Science and Technology,129 located in Wuhan province, another “very high” risk 
O university (according to the ASPI tracker), due to its ties to the Chinese industrial military 
R

Many of  the research mentioned in these articles were financed by the national 863 D
U

Program,131 launched in March 1983. Its goal is to support and foster the development of  C

cutting-edge technologies in seven key sectors, including computer science. Hu Huaping’s T
I

research was also funded by other bodies, notably key laboratories in network security and O
N

cryptology in Fujian province,132 as well as the National Foundation for Natural Sciences.133

Hu’s papers helped identify the names, and sometimes profiles, of  additional 
Unit 61070 members. For example, Dong Hailiang (董海) and Liu Jianfeng (刘建锋), C
both born in 1984, were confirmed as working on information security and cryptography. O

ing on communication techniques and propaganda. For example, he has worked on topics 
tied to the use of  specific writing styles for external communication, using the overseas edi-
tion of  People’s Daily as a case study,138 as well as on the effectiveness of  narrative processes A

tify its members and research areas. Wang Wei (王维), born in 1970, was a lead engineer D
U

for Unit 61198 from 2011 to 2017 at least. Like many others from Unit 61070, he worked C

on network security. His papers, often co-written with NUDT researchers, explored com- T
I

munication architecture,144 computer worm detection systems,145 a trust model to choose O
N

a cloud computing service,146 or a research algorithm.147 His work was funded by the same 
bodies that supported Unit 61070’s research: the national 863 Program, the National 
Foundation for Natural Sciences, and laboratories on network security and cryptology in C
Fujian province. Another member affiliated to Unit 61198 published a 2015 article on sat- O
ellite positioning,148 and a 2016 article on the benefits of  computerizing military financial N
services.149 C

E
Moreover, some topics are less technical. A 2010 article, for instance, written by four P

unit members, explored a trust mechanism that could foster trust and better military T
relations between China and Taiwan.150 Other papers studied Japan’s method of  “inte- S
gration to the empire” during its occupation of  Taiwan,151 and two others detailed the 
American use of  psychological warfare outside of  armed conflicts.152 More recently, 
in 2016, three unit members co-wrote an article that called for the development of  a 
strong army capable of  winning wars.153 To conclude, Unit 61198’s research inter-
ests, like those of  Unit 61070, include network communication, psychological A

C
warfare, and Taiwan. The subjects are thus aligned with the interests of  Base T
311. O

most likely affiliated to a PLA unit, something we already know.

The Huaxing Training Center may belong to the former Fujian-based company Huaxin D

Holdings was founded in September 2005 – the same year as Base 311 – by CEFC T
I

China Energy Co. Ltd (中国华信能源有限公司) and nicknamed Huaxin. In 2014 Lan O
N

Huasheng (兰华升) took over the company, renaming it Fujian Dasheng Holdings Co. Ltd. 
(福建大生控股有限公司).160 Yet, the company retains ties to CEFC China Energy; Lan 
Huasheng used to collaborate with Ye Jianming (叶简明) the founder and chairman (独 C
立董事) of  Huaxin and he has been an independent board member of  the company since O
2006.161 One of  the most important private companies in China, Huaxing Holdings N
was created by Ye Jianming when he was only 20 years old.162 Lan is also the executive C

E
director of  the China Academy of  Culture (中国文化院).163 This organization, founded by P
the China Energy Fund Committee (CEFC, 中国能源基金委员会) – the CEFC’s think T
tank – is part of  the “Huaxin nexus.”164 S

The CEFC think tank was identified as a platform for political warfare, affiliated 
to the former General Political Department. Its links to the PLA and the Party have been 
well documented.165 For instance, J. Michael Cole explained that the CEFC China Energy 
think tank rented office space in Base 311’s offices.166 Ye Jianming, founder of  Huaxin, 
was also known for his membership to another organization linked to the former General A

C
Political Department during the 2000s: the CAIFC.167 Besides, Huaxin’s think tank made T
headlines on multiple occasions. In 2011, a former PLA officer who worked there gained O
attention after he published a piece in the Global Times about the need for greater demon- R

S
strations of  force in the South China Sea.168 In 2017, its former director Patrick Ho (何志

IV. A web of  relaying platforms P
T
S

A nexus of  associations, non-profit NGOs, and other civilian facades – with blurry 
links to the Chinese authorities – plays a role in the implementation of  influence operations. 
The organizations that make up this web of  actors, irrespective of  their proximity to the 
central government, are all platforms conducing to PRC influence operations. They 
serve the government to varying degrees, at times only facilitating its operations. A
As such, they are referred to as “relaying platforms.” This report does not aim to create C
an exhaustive list of  these organizations, but rather to present the main organizations with T

O
direct links to the PLA, the China Association for International Friendly Contact (CAIFC), R
the China Association for Promotion of  Chinese Culture (CAPCC), as well as the China S
Council for the Promotion of  Peaceful National Reunification (CCPPNR), which has ties 
to the Party, and the China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF). The latter is an 
example of  an organization orbiting at a distance from the nexus, but that still deserves a 
particular attention.

This nexus is sprawling. Many people accumulate or consecutively occupy key A
positions in a number of  these organizations. The former vice president of  the National C
People’s Congress (NPC), Xu Jialu (许嘉璐), is one of  them. A respected intellectual T
known for promoting Chinese values and culture around the world, Xu Jialu has served as I

O
president of  the CAPCC, honorary president of  the CCPPNR, founder and president of  N
the Nishan Forum on World Civilizations’ organizing committee, principal advisor to the S
CAIFC, president of  the CEFC advisory committee, and president of  the China Academy 
of  Culture.181

A number of  officers from the former General Political Department’s Liaison Department 
(GPD/LD) have held positions in these organizations. This is particularly the case of  the 
CAIFC, which was under the direct authority of  the GPD/LD.182

Modeled after the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries 
(CPAFFC, 中国人民对外友好协会),193 the CAIFC was created in 1984. According 
to Stokes and Hsiao, it is one of  the most important platforms relaying PLA and 
CCP influence operations. It was a direct subordinate to the GPD/LD, probably its 
Investigation and Research bureau.194 This is why multiple GPD/LD officers held positions A
at the CAIFC. Today, the association is presumably under the authority of  the new Liaison C
Department in the Political Work Department (PWD/LD). Moreover, Chen Yuan (陈元) T
is its current director. Xin Qi and Deng Rong (邓榕), the daughter of  Deng Xiaoping, and O

Yi Xian (乙先), who is also vice president of  CAPCC, are the CAIFC’s vice presidents. S
Finally, Liang Hongchang, is also still a member of  the CAIFC board of  directors, under 
the alias Liang Shi.195

The CAIFC’s mode of  operation consists in making contact and cultivating relation- N
ships with foreign elites, in the defense sector especially, but also with lawmakers and S

other influential actors in target countries. Its aim is to diffuse a positive image of  China 
through them.196 Henry Kissinger is an “old friend” of  the CAIFC197 for instance. And 
the US-China Sanya Initiative is an example of  a CAIFC project that was created to foster 
better relations with the US military elite (see section below).

At the provincial level, there are Associations for International Friendly Contact (AIFC) 
as well. And the Liaison Department directors of  the former military regions’ political C

departments served as deputy directors of  these AIFCs.198 It can be assumed that these S

E 1. The US-China Sanya Initiative: how to influence US generals
P
T Since 2008, the CAIFC has organized the US-China Sanya Initiative (中美高级退役将
S 领交流活动), officially named the “US-China High-Ranking Retired Generals Exchange 

Initiative,” in partnerrship with the EastWest Institute (EWI). The EWI is an NGO that 
promotes international dialogue and acts as a platform for informal diplomacy. The initia-
tive’s English name refers to the city of  Sanya, in Hainan province in China, where the first 
dialogue was held in 2008. The event is sponsored by the CUSEF (→ p. 125) and, in 2018, 

A
C the program celebrated its 10th anniversary.
T According to the organizers and participants, the goals of  the initiative are to improve 
O communication and mutual understanding, as well as to create a space for cooperation in 
R case of  a crisis.202 These dialogues often take place in Beijing over the course of  a day 
S or two of  informal discussions. The Chinese and American delegations typically discuss 

a variety of  topics of  interest, including Chinese-American military relations, conflicts in 
the South and East China seas, the Korean peninsula, counter-terrorism, cyber security, 
or Taiwan and its relationship with China. These exchanges always coincide with current 
events, such as Xi Jinping’s visit to the US, the US elections, or the 2016 arbitration of  the 

A South China Sea dispute by the Permanent Court of  Arbitration.203

C During the day, the participants meet with one or multiple important American or 
T
I Chinese figures. In fact, the delegations were invited to meet with GPD directors on 
O multiple occasions: General Zhang Yang (张阳) in 2013 and 2015 and General Miao 
N Hua (苗华) in 2017 and 2018. They met other important Chinese military figures like 
S General Xu Qiliang (许其亮), vice president of  the CMC in 2015, and Lieutenant General 

Li Zuocheng (李作成) in 2013, at the time commander of  the Chengdu military region 
but now a general and the Joint Chiefs of  Staff  director. In 2016, the 7th dialogue took 
place in Washington, D.C. and New York. This allowed participants to meet high rank-
ing American officials like Senators John McCain and Tom Cotton, Representative Rick 
Larsen, then-Deputy Secretary of  State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel, 

C
A and Maurice R. Greenberg, president of  CV Starr & Co. Inc.
S The US delegation was led by (retired) Admiral William A. Owens, a former vice chair-
E man of  the Joint Chiefs of  Staff. Owens has publicly pushed for better US-China relations, 

opposed the Taiwan Relations Act which he considered detrimental to the US, advocated for

U

economic relations – positions that Beijing favors.204 Since his retirement, Admiral Owens C

is believed to have defended Chinese interests through his appointment to various boards T
I

of  directors. With the help of  Amerilink, a firm he created in 2009, he tried to help his first O
N

client, Huawei, enter the American market, by winning a contract with the telecommunica-
tions company Sprint Nexel. Probably to quell concerns regarding Huawei’s connection to 
Beijing, he enlisted the help of  former congressman Richard Gephardt and former World C
Bank president James Wolfensohn. While Alcatel and Samsung were eventually awarded O
the contract, Owens’ efforts resulted in Huawei being one of  the final six companies con- N
sidered.205 C

E
Among the influential officers who participated in these dialogues were General Ronald P

R. Fogleman, former Air Force Chief  of  Staff, Admiral Timothy J. Keating, former com- T
mander of  the Pacific Command (PACOM), General Charles H. Jacoby, former commander S
of  the Northern Command (NORCOM), General John Abizaid, former commander of  
the Central Command (CENTCOM), and General Walter L. Sharp, former commander of  
the US forces in Korea. On the Chinese side, the US-China Sanya Initiative is managed by 
three people, Xin Qi and Yi Xian, both vice-presidents of  the CAIFC, and Li Haoyu (李浩
宇), secretary general of  the CAIFC. Stokes and Hsiao hypothesized that Haoyu was also A

P
T authority of  the former GDP/LD.208 It should not be confused with the Chinese Culture 
S Promotion Society (中华文化促进), which has an almost identical name in Chinese. In 2020, 

for unknown reasons, the CAPCC’s website was no longer accessible even though it had still 
been working in the summer 2019.209 The CAPCC is one of  the organizers of  the Chinese 
Culture Development Forum (→ p. 433), alongside the CEFC China Energy’s China Culture

C
T company Huayi Audio Visual ((中国华艺音像实 业有限公司), the CEO of  which, Bao 
O Lixian (鲍立衔), was deputy director of  the CAPCC.211 The association also appears to have

C Conference (CPPCC), the standing committee of  the National People’s Congress (NPC), 
A and the United Front Work Department (UFWD).
S
E Each year during the NPC, the CPPCC gathers and consults with various political par-

ties, representatives of  ethnic groups, and other organizations. Wang Yang (汪洋), the cur-

• Jiusan Society (JS, 九三学社) – President: Wu Weihua (武维华);
• Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDSGL, 台湾民主自治同盟) – A
President: Su Hui (苏辉). C

T
Among the other political personalities who jointly held vice presidential positions at O

the CPPCC and the CCPPNR, we noted Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai (帕巴拉·格列朗杰), R
president of  the Autonomous Region of  Tibet, Zheng Jianbang (郑建邦), RCCK member, S

and Gao Yunlong (高云龙), CDNCA member.214

The National People’s Congress (全国人民代表大会) is made up of  some 3,000 representa-
tives, indirectly elected for five years, who meet once a year in session. Most seats are held by CCP 
members, but there are also independent representatives and members of  the eight authorized par-
ties. The NPC does not have any real legislative or executive power as it remains under the author- A
ity of  the CCP. Its role is largely symbolic. The NPC’s standing committee is composed of  175 C

T
people, including multiple CCPPNR vice-presidents: Wan Exiang (RCCK), Chen Zhu (CPWDP), I
Ding Zhongli (CDL), Hao Mingjin (CDNCA), Cai Dafeng (CAPD), or Wu Weihua (JS). O

Finally, You Quan (尤 权), the CCPPNR secretary general and second in command, N
S

and Tan Tianxing (谭天星), are respectively the director and deputy director of  the CCP’s 
Central Committee UFWD. You Quan is also secretary of  the CCP Secretariat.

The CCPPNR has developed a network:of  offices on all continents. According to a 2019 
study by the Jamestown Foundation, it is present in 91 countries, including France, the 
United Kingdom, the US, Canada, and Australia.215

D the CUSEF describes itself  as an “independent, non-profit, privately funded, and non-gov-
U
C ernmental foundation… [that] builds platforms to encourage constructive dialogue and 
T
I diverse exchanges between the people of  the US and China.” But it functions as a de facto 
O
N front organization for the PRC government216: it is one of  the most active United 

Front relays working in the US. Links between the CUSEF and UFWD are well-es-
tablished. The founder and president of  the CUSEF, Tung Chee-Hwa (董建華), a former 

C executive chief  of  Hong Kong (1997-2005), was also the vice president of  the CPPCC’s 21th 
O National Committee. Besides, the CUSEF board of  directors includes known UFWD and 
N CCP members.217 Liu Changle, the CEO of  Phoenix Media Investment (Holdings) Ltd. and 
C
E founder of  Phoenix Television, is on the board of  directors for instance. Phoenix Television 
P is a rare non-governmental stations authorized in China, pointing to Liu Changle’s close 
T relationship to the CCP.218 Finally, Henry Kissinger is CUSEF’s honorary advisor.219

S Apart from the US-China Sanya Initiative, which it has sup-
ported since its inception, the CUSEF sponsors a number of  
high-level dialogues. Similarly to the Sanya dialogue, but with 
non-military participants, the US-China High-Level 
Political Party Leaders Dialogue (中美政党对话) brings 

A
C together political leaders. Organized with the CCP’s 
T International Liaison Department (ILD) and the EastWest 
O Institute, this dialogue offers a delegation of  American politicians (Democrats and 
R
S Republicans) the opportunity to meet with CCP members and discuss current events. The 

10th dialogue, which took place in 2017 in Beijing, was led by Song Tao, the ILD minister, 
Martin O’Malley, former Democratic governor of  Maryland, and Alphonso Jackson, the 
former Republican Housing and Urban Development Secretary.220

Additionally, alongside the EWI and the China Institute of  International Studies, the 
CUSEF organizes the US-China High-Level Security Dialogue, which allows schol-

A ars, former and current government representatives, military officers, and Chinese and 
C
T American CEOs to exchange and produce recommendations for decisionmakers in both 
I countries, hence fostering mutual understanding.221 Among its other events, the CUSEF 
O sponsored the Conference on US-China Infrastructure Cooperation (中美基础设施建设
N
S 合作研讨会) in 2017 with the EWI and the China Institutes of  Contemporary International 

Relations (CICIR), a think tank believed to be an office of  the MSS.222 It also supported 
the Forum on China-US Relations, organized in Suzhou in 2016 with the Chinese People’s 
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), the Shanghai Institute for 
International Studies, and the Carter Center (a US think tank). They have also sponsored 
“China Forums” in elite US universities like New York University, the University of  

C Chicago, and Johns Hopkins. In 2019, the CUSEF and the China Center for International

Despite being registered as a “foreign agent” in the US, the CUSEF funds research T
I

center and projects in American universities and think tanks, including at some O
N

influential institutions in Washington. This funding became controversial when it was 
revealed in 2017 that the CUSEF partially funded a new chair in China Studies at the pres-
tigious School of  Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of  John Hopkins University.224 C
The foundation’s academic projects are only “the tip of  the iceberg” however. The CUSEF O
is involved “in a much larger, multi-faceted effort to exert influence on US policy,” N
notably as a sponsor of  lobbying activities directed at Congress, as well as to local C

E
and federal authorities.225

P
To do so, it uses intermediaries, including American PR firms (at least 7 since T

2010).226 For instance, these firms manage a website funded by the CUSEF, chinausfocus. S
com, created in 2011 (with a Chinese version in 2015), in addition to other publications.227 
John Dotson explained that “this practice – of  using a public relations firm to manage 
synthetic think tank publication, which in turn published material that aligns with PRC 
propaganda narratives – matches a pattern seen elsewhere in the world, as with the Sinoskop 
website launched in the Czech Republic in 2019.”228 These activities “represent a sort of  A

C
‘lobbying laundering’ in which a nominally independent third-party organization T
acts as a primary agent for funding and managing lobby efforts on behalf  of  the O
PRC.”229 R

S
In 2015 and 2016, the CUSEF also brought delegations from the Center for American 

Progress, a Washington-based think tank, to China. In 2016, the delegation met with “Zhang 
Gaoli (张高丽), then-PRC Vice Premier and a member of  the CCP Politburo Standing 
Committee; Jin Liqun (金立群), president of  the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank; 
and Admiral Sun Jianguo (孙建国), deputy chief  of  the PLA Joint Staff  Department.”230

The CUSEF’s exchange programs target more than military and political leaders: many A
are geared toward students. These programs offer students the opportunity to visit China C

T
and they are usually organized in collaboration with the CPAFFC. Students from Columbia I
University, the University of  Chicago, Harvard (Kennedy School of  Government), UC O
Berkeley, Georgetown, and Johns Hopkins (SAIS) have already been invited to visit China N

S
for instance. Other programs target American media representatives. Staff  members from 
The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Chicago Tribute, the National Public Radio, Vox, Bloomberg, 
Reuters, and Forbes have participated in CUSEF programs.

DATA COLLECTION TOOLS 
C
O
N
C
E

Influence operations require massive amounts of  data, on which they depend P
to know whom to influence, when, and how. Beijing uses “two combined approaches: T

S
‘bulk data collection’ and targeted data collection.”1 Bulk data collection refers to the use 
of  numerous sensors to harvest large amounts of  data, and Chinese services – due to their 
large workforce and advanced algorithms – are particularly well equipped to analyze it. 
Data collection is done through espionage and cyber-attacks (the 2018 data breach at 
the Australian National University and the 2019 cyberattack on the Australian parliament A
for instance, likely in order to build detailed profiles of  individuals), but also by co-opt- C
ing regimes, building infrastructures, developing new technologies. It heavily relies T
on public and private companies. According to Samantha Hoffman, “[to] get access to O

R
global data, the Party uses state-owned enterprises, Chinese and foreign technological firms, S
and others partners such as university researchers. The CCP [is] using capitalism as a vehicle 
to access data that can help it disrupts democratic processes and create a more favorable 
global environment for its power.”2 

The nature of  the Chinese regime, a one-party state where the state is an institutional 
façade with no real power, forces all sizable companies to closely engage with the Party. A
These ties provide Party executives with access to companies – many they help fund through C
Chinese banks, which are primarily politically-minded. In fact, no important company in T
China can prosper without aligning itself  with the Party. Since Xi Jinping came to I
power, this trend has only increased with the adoption of  the Made in China 2025 pro- O

N
gram, the Belt and Road Initiative, and AI development plans. The Party’s growing control S
over the strategy of  high-tech companies has led Chinese firms in this sector to hire Party 
members, to expand the companies’ network, obtain political protection, and consequently 
become more competitive. 

In 2015 China elevated the military-civil fusion (军民融合) as a national strategy.3 In 
January 2017, the government established the Central Military-Civil Fusion Development 
Committee (中央军民融合发展委员会) and the publication of  the Special Plan for C
Scientific & Technological Military-Civil Fusion (科技军民融合发展专项规划). The A
goal was to facilitate innovation in dual technologies in key sectors, such biology, S

E
the space industry, artificial intelligence, and information technologies.4 To do

U
C with the public-sector defense industry. This program came from a desire to accelerate 
T
I the PLA’s modernization and to convert civilian technological innovations into 
O
N military gains.

These efforts were also part of  a larger strategy aimed at strengthening the Party’s 
control over the private sector. In 2016, Xi Jinping argued for a modernization of  the 

C management of  state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by integrating “CCP objectives in all 
O aspects of  corporate governance,” which led many SOEs to amend their internal struc-
N ture to include a role for the Party in daily corporate matters.5 Then, in 2017, Article 
C
E 7 of  the National Intelligence Act mandated all Chinese companies, public or 
P private, as well as all citizens to “support, aid, and cooperate with national intel-
T ligence efforts, in accordance with the law, and protect national secrets, related to 
S intelligence activities, they are aware of.”6 The Canadian Security Intelligence Service 

(CSIS) explained that this law “applies to Chinese companies and individuals abroad 
[…] pointing to the judicial cooperation between the CCP and Chinese companies and 
citizens.”7 On September 15, 2020, this trend was reinforced when the CCP issued the 
“Opinion on Strengthening the United Front Work of  the Private Economy in 

A
C the New Era,”8 which institutionalized the Party’s influence over Chinese com-
T panies. For Scott Livingston, “the fact that China has released this opinion at a time of  
O heightened US scrutiny over the government’s links to Huawei […] suggest that China 
R
S feels confident enough in its system that it is now prepared to advance and defend it 

on the global stage.”9 In the end, the Party seems ready to openly assume these links 
and the lack of  autonomy of  the private sector with regard to the best interests of  
the Party.

servers in Shanghai. This scandal made the headlines globally, highlighting the risks asso- T
I

ciated with Chinese-built infrastructure, particularly (yet not only) in Africa, where they are O
N

particularly numerous.
A 2020 report pointed out that Chinese companies built or renovated at least 186 

government buildings in Africa since 1966, including “at least 24 presidential or prime C
minister residences or offices; at least 26 parliaments or parliamentary offices; at least 32 O
military or police installations; and at least 19 ministries of  foreign affairs buildings.”12 The N
Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE have set up at least 14 sensitive government C

E
telecommunication networks, including systems used by police and armed forces. The P
Chinese government also provided office equipment, like computers, to at least 35 T
African governments. The majority of  these companies are SOEs, though even private S
sector companies are now beholden to the CCP collaboration law, specifically in terms of  
data collection. The information harvested through infrastructure and equipment 
can be used to recruit potential intelligence assets or compromise and coerce lead-
ers – including personal information on the habits and preferences of  numerous political 
actors. They also “facilitate Beijing’s influence operations on the continent” as the data A

C
is used to tailor operations according to the targets.13 It is plausible that Beijing specifically T
sought to secure these construction projects, or even fund them entirely, in order to further O
its influence operations. At least 40 of  the 54 African countries have infrastructure R

S
built by Chinese companies, including Namibia (25 governmental buildings), Angola 
(15), Equatorial Guinea (11), Ghana (11), Uganda (11), Sierra Leone (8), Mozambique (7) 
and Zambia (7).14

B. Submarine communications cables A
C

Submarine communications cables are responsible for close to 95% of  global com- T
I

munications, being faster than satellite communications (40 milliseconds for fiber optic O
cables compared to 540 ms. for satellites).15 Along with data centers, these cables are the N
backbone of  the Internet’s physical layer. As such, they are an important geopolitical S
asset.

The map of  submarine communication cables reflects the historically advantaged posi-
tion of  the United States and United Kingdom. These two countries remain the two pri-
mary communication nodes, despite recent network developments in other parts of  the 
world. Indeed, the UK is connected to 49 of  the existing 265 cables, and ensures nearly 
all of  the exchanges between Europe and North America.16 And the US is a practically C
inescapable communication node, due not only to the density of  American connections, A

D but also the quality of  the network. In fact, routers dictate the trajectory of  the data based 
U
C solely on speed; and given that American network infrastructures are the most proficient, 
T
I an enormous amount of  data is “diverted” through the US. This occurs even if  a “geo-
O
N graphically” shorter trajectory is available, for instance, in the case of  data transferred from 

Europe to Asia.17

Controlling submarine communication cables is an enormous political and stra-
C tegic asset. It allows those in control to capture information transferred by these cables, 
O similarly to what the NSA (the “Upstream” program) and the GCHQ (the “Tempora” 
N program) did, and to cut communications during times of  political tensions or armed con-
C
E flict. During World War I, telegraph cables were used in this manner. Initially developed 
P as trading tool, telegraph cables were converted into a weapon immediately after the war 
T began, as British authorities were able to interrupt and cut a significant share of  German 
S communications. At the time, London controlled over three fourths of  all telegraph cables, 

holding a quasi-monopoly over the use, installment, and upkeep of  the cables.18

Given the political stakes, China made submarine cables a priority for the digital Silk 
Road. Multiple companies, including Huawei Marine Networks, were encouraged to invest 
heavily in the sector. China’s progress in this endeavor has been extremely quick. 

A
C Although China owns only 11.4% of  existing submarine cables, it owns 24% of  cables 
T under construction. In Asia, 30% of  installed cables, as well as more than 50% of  cables in 
O development, are controlled by China. Besides, Huawei “completed a cable stretching nearly 
R
S 4,000 miles from Brazil to Cameroon. The cable is partly owned by China Unicom.”19

The Chinese authorities want to improve their capacity to capture data transiting 
through submarine cables. This will allow them to exert greater pressure in case of  
a political or economic conflict, particularly in its neighboring countries. In fact, China’s 
investment in submarine cables has strengthened its operational ability to cut the cables 
it acquired and it could then turn it against Taiwan. Countries like Taiwan could easily 

A have their international communication crippled due to Chinese cable domination.20 These 
C
T developments are congruent with Beijing’s deployment of  an underwater surveillance sys-
I tem aimed at improving submarine detection, notably targeting American submarines in 
O the South China Sea.21
N
S China’s political expansion and cable capacity development faces serious obstacles. In 2013, 

the US government defeated a transatlantic cable project between New York and London in 
which Huawei was a stakeholder.22 More recently, Washington’s efforts to slow Huawei’s rise 
on 5G led Huawei to sell its shares of  Huawei Marine Systems (which owns Huawei Marine 
Networks) to another Chinese company, Hengtong Optic-Electric.23 Huawei’s strategy was to 
avoid the deceleration of  the Chinese penetration in this key market.

N

The navigational system BDS (Beidou Navigation Satellite System), developed by Wuhan C
E

Optics Valley Beidou Holding Group, has been operational since 2012. The development P
of  BDS added China to the very exclusive group of  international powers with global T
navigation systems (Global Navigation Satellite Systems, GNSS) to which the US (GPS), S
the EU (GALILEO), and Russia (GLONASS) belong. By the end of  2020, the Chinese 
company had presumably close to fifty satellites, covering all New Silk Road countries. 
This system allows China to penetrate all of  these markets.

With Beidou, China has gotten independent from the US-owned GPS system.24 Prior to 
the development of  Beidou, the US could cut China off from certain zones in case of  a A

C
conflict. China in turn could exert the same pressure on any country using the Beidou T
system (instead of  the GPS). Beidou provides then both autonomy and influence, O
a central element in the construction of  the digital Silk Road.25 Besides, the Taiwanese R
minister of  Science and Technology argued that the Beidou system creates a risk of espi- S

onage. He explained that the Chinese government could use Beidou to track smartphone 
users through embedded malware or navigation signals.26 Currently, it does not appear that 
Beidou has the technological ability to do so however.27 Regardless, the “spatial information 
corridor,” defined by Beijing, should in fine accelerate the partition of  the planet into two 
spheres of  influence, American and Chinese.28 A

and the retaliatory measures adopted by Beijing (including the arrest of  two Canadian cit-

China regarding Huawei has gone public. Beyond a play for power, this conflict has high-

ate the security risks attached to Huawei. C

O
D from China’s rapid ascension in the telecoms sector. It not only conquered the Chinese 
U
C market, but successfully penetrated markets around the world.29 And unlike its main com-
T
I petitors Nokia and Ericsson, who primarily make phones, Huawei is an integrated soci-
O
N ety, present across the entire value chain. For example, Huawei is Deutsche Telekom, 

Vodafone, and Telefonica’s supplier in Europe.30

The Meng Wanzhou affair, and the US oppositional stance vis-à-vis Chinese companies 
C operating in sensitive sectors, have led to a debate in the West about security risks associ-
O ated to Huawei and 5G. But concerns about the proximity of  Chinese companies with the 
N CCP’s defense and intelligence apparatuses, and increasingly frequent cases of  corporate 
C
E espionage, had also paved the way for this debate.
P Obviously, the US position does not only stem from a desire to protect its scientific and 
T industrial property, but also from a desire to slow, or even halt, the rise of  Chinese compa-
S nies in strategic sectors. While this threat can be exaggerated at times, Huawei does raise 

security questions for countries that allow the company to build all, or part, of  their 
5G infrastructure.31 

There are multiple security concerns. Is one of  them. For example, when the Dutch 
telephone operator KPN installed Huawei technology in 2009, despite repeated warn-

A
C ings from the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) about, it asked 
T Capgemini to conduct a risk analysis. The report produced by the consulting firm found 
O that Huawei had the ability to listen in on “KPN’s mobile numbers in an unlimited, 
R
S uncontrolled and unauthorized manner,” including those of  the Prime Minister 

and ministers, and had access to the database of  all telephone numbers. The report 
concluded that “authorities and companies could withdraw their confidence in KPN if  
it became public that the Chinese government could tap KPN’s mobile numbers and 
paralyze the network.”32 This report remained secret until the Volkskrant newspaper, 
which had access to it, reported the findings in April 2021.33 Similarly, in Poland, a for-

A mer Huawei official was arrested in January 2019: he is accused of  being a “Chinese 
C
T intelligence officer placed under a commercial cover at Huawei Polska” and to have “pro-
I vided information to these services that could have been detrimental to the Republic of  
O Poland.”34
N
S Another concern is the nature of  the company and its ties to the PLA’s intelligence 

services. Several articles have mentioned the collaboration between Huawei and the PLA, 
which dates back to the company’s inception. In fact, Ren Zhengfei presumably contrib-
uted to the construction of  a network of  communication infrastructure during the 1990s.35 
This initial contract may have created a privileged relationship between Huawei and the 
military. Moreover, the recent military-civil fusion effort has specifically targeted telecom-

C munications. As such, it is highly likely that Huawei is involved in defense programs. In 
A 2013, the Indian Intelligence Bureau (domestic intelligence) affirmed that Huawei and ZTE

Forbes claimed that Huawei worked with Bo Yu Guangzhou Information Technology Co, O
N

considered to be one of  the groups of  hackers working for the Chinese government.37 The 
company was listed in an indictment for attacks on US firms by the US Justice Department. 
Huawei never denied its links to Boyusec, but claimed that they simply conducted an eval- C
uation of  Huawei systems. O

Evidence has already shown that the company, which provides “surveillance systems N
for entire cities,” “has knotted a partnership with the police,” in Xinjiang for instance. C

E
Because Huawei signed “a strategic cooperation agreement with the Ministry of  Public P
Security of  Xinjiang,”38 the German researcher Adrian Zenz described “this region [as] T
a laboratory for the Police State of  the 21st century, to which Huawei closely collabo- S
rates.” He thought it probable that “Huawei’s technology had already been used to identify 
Uyghur people and to contribute to their internment.” He then concluded that “Huawei 
is a strategic tool used by the Chinese state to repress the Uyghurs, and probably a 
major Trojan Horse threatening the security of  telecommunications elsewhere in 
the world.”39 A

C
In a July 2019 article, Christopher Balding discussed the intimate ties between Huawei T

and the Chinese state security services, seemingly confirming the fears expressed by the O
US government and its allies.40 Balding’s research was based on the analysis of  the CVs R

S
of  Huawei employees, which revealed prior professional affiliation to Chinese intelligence. 
While this method is innovative and interesting, 3 CVs are not enough to support Balding’s 
conclusion. Even the case of  Li Jingguo, who supposedly worked as a representative for the 
Ministry of  State Security (MSS), cannot confirm extensive ties between the institutions, 
nor the instrumentalization of  Huawei by the MSS.

In fact, intelligence services have little to gain from establishing a direct control over A
Huawei and installing covert agents. The 2017 intelligence law already provided a legal C

T
framework for the government to coerce Chinese companies into collaborating with I
its intelligence services. On that note, Huawei hired the law firm Zhong Lun to defend O
the company, stating that Beijing can only ask for their assistance in specific and clear N

S
cases of  counterespionage.41 Furthermore, they defended that no existing law mandates 
Huawei to implant backdoors in IT system, because Chinese law protects the interests 
of  companies. Finally, they argued that Huawei branches and subsidiaries abroad are not 
subjugated to Chinese law. The nature of  the Chinese regime severely undercuts

D vices. Notable in Huawei’s defense is their law firm’s link to the CCP. Zhang Xuebing, the 
U
C managing partner of  Zhang Lun law firm, is also the secretary of  the Beijing Lawyers’ 
T
I Association. The law firm made waves after Xi Jinping’s election as it participated in sub-
O
N duing civil liberties defense lawyers. 

Furthermore, Christopher Balding and Donald Clarke have questioned Huawei’s 
financial structure, highlighting that it was impossible to determine its real owner. Ren 

C Zhengfei, the official owner, only possesses a fraction of  the company. Huawei, whose full 
O name is Huawei Technologies Inc., is entirely owned by Huawei Investment & Holding, 
N a much smaller company of  about one hundred employees. This holding is co-owned by 
C
E the founder Ren Zhengfei (“about 1.01%”) and a CCP-aligned union, called the Huawei 
P Investment & Holding Company Trade Union Committee (HHTUC), which owns the 
T remaining 98.99%. According to the two authors, the opaque nature of  the system deflects 
S any attempt to understand the articulation of  the respective responsibilities of  the different 

structures.
Finally, two former managers of  Huawei’s Czech branch anonymously reported, to 

a local radio, that they were required to enter the information of  private client into the 
company database, such as number of  children, their preferences, and financial situa-

A
C tion. The database was managed by the headquarters, and they did not know who could 
T access it. The collected data was routinely discussed with Chinese embassy officials. Data 
O regarding top Czech officials was also collected, with some of  them subsequently invited 
R
S to China.42

C. Databases

Chinese authorities understood long ago that in order to “guide” or “channel” a peo-
A ple– with a quasi-hydrological approach to public opinion,43 it first needed to know 
C it. Surveillance, through a massive data collection and analysis of  habits and indi-
T
I vidual preferences, is essential in that endeavor. And automated tools are needed, which 
O leads to a tight link between the control of  public opinion and big data technologies in 
N China, as well as between the Party-State and private companies.44 Initially (and mostly) 
S a technique to control domestic public opinion, the Chinese authorities are increasingly 

using this tactic to shape public opinions abroad. According to Jessica Blake and Mareike 
Ohlberg, “the emergence of  the public opinion service sector offers a glimpse of  what 
[Chinese] techno-authoritarianism might actually look like […]: The Party-state’s 
use of, and reliance on, private technology companies to manage the volatile interaction 
between ideas, speech, and society.”45 An increasing number of  studies have focused 

C on China’s “digital authoritarianism.”46 In this context, Beijing’s use of  databases to 
A
S feed into and prepare influence operations abroad can be illustrated by the following two 
E examples.

A report published in September 2020 provided for the first time “direct evidence of  
data collected by China on its monitoring and data collection on foreign individ-
uals and institutions for purposes of  intelligence and influence operations.”49 The 
authors were able to access the Overseas Key Information Database (OKIDB), a database A
created by the company Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Information Technology Co. It con- C
tained information on “2.4 million individuals, 650 thousand organizations, 2.3 billion news T

O
articles, and 2.1 billion social media posts.”50 The data was siphoned from a variety of  other R
databases, including Factiva, as well as social networks, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, S
and others. China Revival appeared to be using these websites to build personal profiles 
that included family relationships and work histories. Additionally, the database con-
tained photographs of  the individuals in question. The study estimated that the majority of  
the information compiled came from open sources, but around 10% to 20% did not. The 
authors believed that “some of  the data comes from unauthorized data access such as A
hacking.”51 Among the individuals found in the database, many were public sector employ- C
ees: “everyone from known politicians to political aides to low level military personnel.”52 T

I
The database also contained information about the business world, academic and scientific O
communities, think tanks, and even organized crime. The common element among them N
was that “all are individuals and institutions Chinese security, intelligence, and influ- S
ence operations are known to be interested in targeting.”53

The database was used for analysis: “designed to assist the Chinese government, security, 
and intelligence services, OKIDB adds in multi-layered functionality to help target and link 
individuals. Though not extensive, we found analyst notes about certain targets. Certain 
indexes had classifiers for individuals or institutions such as importance.”54 It also enabled 
the mapping of  personal and professional relationships. C

SUMMARY OF THE SECOND PART C
O
N
C
E

Contrary to the prevalent assumption generally made about authoritarian regimes, “China” P
is not a unitary actor. In fact, the relative fragmentation of  the regime can impact the T
nature of  its influence operations. These operations are implemented by four major institu- S
tional actors: The Party, the state, the army, and the companies.

• Within the Party, there are five main bodies implementing influence operations:
- The Propaganda Department, in charge of  ideology, controls all media and the cultural A

production in the country. It is a powerful machine that aims to shape the dominant discourse, C
control mass media, restrict freedom of  speech and critical thought, guide and manipulate T
public opinion, defend its interests, justify its actions, and present the state positively. The E
Propaganda Department also controls a vast network operating within China and abroad. It O
commands a variety of  vectors of  information and is increasingly aggressive in its data col- S
lection efforts.

- The United Front Work Department (UFWD), has twelve offices which reflect its principal 
targets: political parties; ethnic minorities; Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan; the private sector econ-
omy; non-CCP intellectuals; new social classes; Tibet; Xinjiang; overseas Chinese (two offices); and 
religious affairs (two offices as well). A

- The International Liaison Department (ILD) engages with foreign political parties, C
through “party diplomacy,” with dual objectives. It aims to build a global consensus that T

I
favors Beijing (supporting China’s “friends,” reinforcing its soft power and its discursive O
power) and it serves as an analysis and observation platform (and possibly also intelligence N
gathering). S

- The Chinese Communist Youth League (CYL) is simultaneously a breeding ground 
for future Party members, directly funneling the youth into the CCP system and ideology, and 
a disposable reserve of  manpower (over 80 million members aged 14 to 28). The CYL has its 
own propaganda methods, in Chinese and English. It is increasingly present on social media, 
where it promotes the Party, glorifies the state, and criticizes the US through humor and sar-
casm. The rap group CD Rev is an example of  a CYL agent: it is one of  the most effective C
anti-American discourse tools targeting the Chinese youth around the world. Several examples A
of  CYL actions demonstrate its ability to manipulate the Chinese population and mobilize the S
Chinese youth, particularly those living abroad, with the purpose of  contributing to coordi- E
nated operations.

- The 610 Office, an entity with presumably around 15,000 members in China and abroad, 
operates outside of  any legal framework to eradicate the Falun Gong movement. There are 610 
Office members in every Chinese diplomatic mission, in charge of  detecting, reporting, and per-
secuting followers of  the movement. They are also involved in propaganda activities aimed at dis- C

O
suading foreign governments of  engaging with the followers. N

O
D • Within the state, two main structures are involved in influence operations:
U
C - The Ministry of  State Security (MSS) is the main civilian intelligence agency. Composed of  
T
I 17 or 18 divisions, some of  them use covers to conduct operations abroad (for instance, the 4th Di-
O
N vision uses the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Office of  the Bureau of  International Cooperation 

Chinese Academy of  Sciences as a cover). 
- The Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) is in charge of  propaganda targeting Taiwan. It supervises 

C multiple media as part of  this effort.
O
N
C • Within the Popular Liberation Army (PLA), which is the military branch of  the Party rath-
E er than a national army, the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), and 
P especially the Network Systems Department, has probably inherited the capacities and missions in 
T the information, cyber, and electromagnetic domains since the 2015 reforms.
S PLA Unit 61716 is a key actor also known as the “public opinion warfare, psychological 

warfare, and legal warfare unit,” or Base 311. Dedicated to the implementation of  the “Three 
Warfares” strategy, it centralizes all psychological warfare efforts against Taiwan. Other activities 
of  the base include research on the US informational environment. The base’s headquarters are 
in the city of  Fuzhou. It is headed by a duo, a commander and a political commissar. And most 

A of  its members are researchers and engineers specialized in information and communication 
C technologies, that can be used for public opinion warfare, notably artificial intelligence.
T
O Base 311 also manages front companies like Voice of  the Strait (VTS), the China Huayi 
R Broadcasting Corporation (whose chairman has always been the Base 311 commander), and the 
S Haifeng publishing house (we believe the director is also a PLA officer) – all branded as civilian 

organizations. These companies have the potential to influence people through radio, television, 
the Internet, social media, and books. The base supervises other PLA units as well, notably Unit 
61070 and Unit 61198 which focus on network communications, psychological warfare and 
Taiwan. Finally, the base maintains a close relationship with a nexus of  platforms like the China 
Association for International Friendly Contact (CAIFC), whose mission is to foster relationships 

A with foreign elites. Within the base, a training center uses a fake hotel as a cover.
C
T
I • Private and public companies play a central role in the data collection essential to influence 
O operations, as it is necessary to know whom to influence, when, and how. There are multiple mech-
N anisms involved in data collection, including espionage, hacking, co-opting regimes, constructing 
S infrastructures, and setting up new technologies. The Party uses firms for these activities. The 

Party-State has implemented different strategies to expand its control over the private sector. The 
first is the military-civil fusion aimed at converting innovative technologies into military gains. The 
second is Article 7 of  the National Intelligence Law, which forces all Chinese companies, private 
and public, as well as citizens, to “support, help, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts.” 
The following tools are specifically used for data collection:

C - Infrastructures, including buildings, were discovered to be data collection tools following 
A the scandal over the African Union headquarter. Built by a Chinese company, it was filled with 
S microphones, and its IT system riddled with backdoors, allowing Chinese intelligence services to 
E absorb all exchanges between staff  members. Chinese companies have built or renovated at least 

186 government buildings in Africa and created at least 14 sensitive government telecommuni-
cation networks, all of  which are at risk of  similar security breaches. The siphoned information 
can be used to recruit potential intelligence assets, coerce leaders, and facilitate Beijing’s influence 
operations. Another tool used for Beijing’s influence operations are the submarine communi-

C cations cables. A priority of  the CCP’s digital Silk Road, these cables allow China to increase its 
O
N data capturing capacity, expanding its ability to exert pressure over other actors during political or 
C economic conflicts.

- New technologies, including the platforms WeChat, Weibo, and TikTok (discussed in an- D

adopted the navigational system, but also poses espionage risks; and Huawei, an integrated com- T

I
pany with a presence across the value chain, which raises concerns because of  the nature of  the O
company and the relationships it may have with the security services and the PLA. Finally, databas- N

es offer a glimpse of  what researchers refer to as Chinese “techno-authoritarianism” or “digital au-
thoritarianism.” These databases feed and prepare influence operations abroad, as exemplified by 
GTCOM (a big data and artificial intelligence company affiliated to the Propaganda Department) C
and OKIDB. The latter is a database company that acknowledges its ties to the PLA and MSS. It O
created millions of  personal profiles detailing the family networks and work histories of  individuals N
“Chinese” security, intelligence, and influence operations are known to be interested in targeting.” C

While not exhaustive, this part is the longest of  the report. It shows the number and P
diversity of  actions undertaken by the Party-State as a part of  its influence operations T
abroad. They can be classified into two approaches: Beijing attempts to seduce and S

subjugate while, at the same time, infiltrate and coerce. These two categories are rel-
evant for analysis and to understand that Chinese influence operations stand on two legs. 
Yet, these two categories are often difficult to distinguish in practice; they are far from 
mutually exclusive. For example, language and culture are an integral part of  the Party’s 
seduction efforts, but education in the Confucius Institutes, pressures exerted on the film A

C
industry and on museum are also methods of  infiltration and coercion. As such, the dis- T
tinction we made is debatable and could have been different. More important than the exact O
categorization of  methods, as many overlap, is to acknowledge the extraordinary diversity R

S
of  methods Beijing uses to seduce, subjugate, infiltrate, and coerce.

At first glance, these two approaches are complimentary. In practice, however, the sec-
ond has clearly become the dominant approach in recent years. This reality is reflected in 
the imbalance between the two chapters of  this section, the latter being fifteen times lon-
ger than the former. This parallels the widespread and globally-shared representation that 
China is becoming increasingly aggressive. Beijing’s seduction efforts have not ceased, but A

C
the Party now uses coercion in a systematic and uninhibited manner. We will address this T
choice, which may prove counter-productive, in the conclusion (→ p. 638). I

SEDUCE AND SUBJUGATE I
O
N

C
O
N
C

The first type of  political warfare strategy enacted by the CCP is to seduce for- E
eign populations. Not unlike the United Front, which aims to eliminate Party enemies P
by rallying them to its cause, this strategy is built on a positive historical narrative on T

S
China, an ameliorative story-telling of  its past and present successes. These narratives 
intend to spark sympathy, if  not adhesion, to China and its political goals. In certain cases, 
they can lead to a complete subjugation (from the Latin jugare which means “attach”) of  
the targets of  these operations of  seduction. Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-
Katsuya explained that “what Chinese strategists understood long ago is that influence is A
far more efficient than control. Ultimately, control is the end result of  strategically C
deployed influence. Rather than launching a frontal attack to gain control over an oppo- T
nent, it is better to be strategic and patient in order to gain influence over them. […] To do O

R
so, silver-tongued emissaries will initially dangle the benefits of  a good relationship, notably S
lucrative economic markets and privileged partnerships.”1

The following section will demonstrate the Chinese seduction strategy through four 
easily identifiable narratives that highlight intrinsically Chinese qualities, values, or 
achievements. They are the “Chinese model,” tradition, benevolence, and power. 
These narratives can aim to build a positive image of  China (positive strategies2) or to “rec- A
tify” erroneous representations on China by debunking negative narratives like the Chinese C
threat theory. As demanded by Xi Jinping, it is primordial to “tell China’s story well and let T
China’s voice be heard.”3 Not all of  these narratives are intended for the same audi- I
ence, and specific channels target different groups. Some target entire populations and O

N
other specific groups within a population (the Chinese diaspora, the journalist or academic S
community, etc.). On rare occasions, these narratives may target one person (a politician, 
for instance), or a small number of  people.

U I. The “Chinese model”
C
T
I China’s seduction strategy relies on the model it implicitly offers to the world, an alter-
O
N native to the liberal democracy. The attractiveness of  this model rests primordially on 

a spectacular economic growth,4 an alleged political and administrative efficiency 
(a “Chinese way” of  operating that is supposedly more efficient than the endless palavers 

C of  democracies – illustrated by the lightning fast, though controversial, construction of  
O hospitals in China to deal with Covid-19 patients), and a political system based on mer-
N
C itocracy and the wisdom of  its leaders rather than on elections.5 
E During a congressional hearing, in March 2020,6 Daniel Tobin noted that the CCP should 
P not be considered a “reactive, defensive, and besieged” archaic organization that is on the 
T
S defensive trying to hold together the relics of  a communist heritage, and slowly dissipating 

after the fall of  the Eastern bloc, as it develops a modern capitalist economy. In fact, the 
Party’s approach reveals revisionist ambitions. Beyond remaining in power, it seeks to 
reconfigure the international order to fit Chinese norms, values, and institutions. It 
is on the basis of  this literature, as well as the memoirs of  party leaders, that Rush Doshi 

A shows that China is indeed endowed with global ambitions constituting a true grand strat-
C egy.7 Jean-Pierre Cabestan notes that China has become the most important revisionist 
T power in the world.8 This is significantly different from the Kremlin’s approach, explained 
O
R Jean-Maurice Ripert, who served as ambassador of  France in both countries. He noted that 
S “China does not believe itself  beholden to human rights standards, as defined by the UN’s 

1948 Universal Declaration of  Human Rights. It advocates for ‘Chinese values’ instead. 
Russia, on the other hand, pretends to uphold human rights.”9 “China wants to impose 
an alternative international order that can be defined as ‘multi-bilateralism.’ In a word, like 
a bicycle wheel, it presents the states act as spokes, leading toward a central point, China! 
Officially, China claims to defend multilateralism, but its actions are in direct contradiction 

A
C to this claim. They push forth a system where countries define themselves in relation to 
T China, where juxtaposing these relationships shapes a new international order, founded on 
I Chinese values.”10 Beijing aspires to fashioning new international order, which it has 
O
N the resources to do. Because Moscow is unable to fashion such a new order, it has 
S opted for a “strategy of  chaos.”11 We will address this comparison further in the conclu-

sion (→ p. 620). 

4. China experienced an average GDP growth of  9.8% per year for over 30 years. While not unique, this growth is 
comparable to that of  South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. From 1950 to 1980, South Korea experienced an annual GDP 
growth of  9.1%, Japan of  7.7%, and Taiwan (between 1960 and 1990) of  8.8%. China’s growth is only slightly better. 
Their average annual GDP growth in purchasing power parity is: 11.7% (China, 1978-2004) 11.1% (Japan, 1950-1980) 
11.1%, 9.5% (South Korea, 1953-1983) and 12.4% (Taiwan, 1960-1990). The Chinese growth is no exception: it is close 

C to the overall regional growth.

Since Xi Jinping’s arrival to power, the promotion of  this model has been incarnated in D
U

two main concepts: “the Chinese solution” (中国方案) and “the community of  com- C

mon destiny” ( T
人类命运共同体). The former illustrates China’s opposition to Francis I

Fukuyama’s famous End of  History thesis,12 which was refuted by Xi Jinping during the O
N

Party’s 95th anniversary in 2016: “history never ended.” The Communist Party is confident 
it can offer humanity an alternative and better social system – in other words, a substitute 
for liberal democratic institutions.13 This was the meaning of  the statement made by He C
Yiting (何毅亭), vice president of  the Central Party School, in May 2020: “Xi Jinping’s O
New Era of  Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is the Marxism of  the 21st century N
[...] China’s development transcends national geographical boundaries and acquires global C

E
historical significance, meaning that China is qualified to be the ideological and theoretical P
pinnacle guiding the innovative development of  world Marxism.”14 T

Then, the “community of  common destiny” is based on the idea of  a global commu- S
nity conscious of  its shared destiny that needs to cooperate to face current challenges. The 
concept already had a place in the Party’s rhetoric before Xi Jinping. Hu Jintao referred to 
it in his speech at the 18th Party Congress, on November 8, 2012, when he said that it was 
necessary to make other countries aware that we are all part of  the “community of  com-
mon destiny.”15 Despite this mention, the concept was not central to Hu’s leadership. Hu A

C
focused more on the concept of  a “harmonious society,” respecting the diversity of  sys- T
tems. Xi Jinping subsequently broke from Hu’s vision, using the concept of  a “community O
of  common destiny” to urge the adoption of  the Chinese model. Besides, the idea of  a R

S
community of  common destiny has ties to the Confucian notion of  Tianxia (天下- “all-un-
der-heaven”), recently re-popularized by Zhao Tingyang (赵汀阳); it has become a subject 
of  intense debates within the Chinese academic community. For now, the Party has seldom 
used the term however.16

The concept of  “community of  common destiny” was added to the Party’s statutes in 
2017, and in the preamble of  the PRC’s constitution in 2018.17 On multiple occasions, Xi A
Jinping introduced the subject abroad, such as during his African visit, at the Bo’ao Forum, C

T
and to ASEAN members in 2013, to the 2017 Davos Forum, and to the United Nations. In I
2015, the term “destiny” was replaced by “future” in the official English translation in order O
to reduce the expansionist character of  the formula and thus avoid suspicion from for- N

S
eign audiences.18 The established English formula thus became the “community of  shared 
future for mankind,” but the Chinese expression remains unchanged. The rhetorical enter-
prise thus aims at distorting the liberal vocabulary in favor of  the CCP’s vision, as Stella 
Chan points out: “the phrase incorporates traditional elements of  Chinese foreign policy

T
I Unlike Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping has a plan to implement his vision: The Belt and 
O
N Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI consists in building platforms and infrastructures 

to help create this “community of  common destiny.” The propaganda campaign on 
behalf  of  the “community of  common destiny” is supported by a plethora of  ameliorative 

C slogans – “win-win” cooperation, “equality among states,” “pacific development,” “pros-
O perity,” “mutual respect,” “friendship between peoples,” and others that foster adhesion to 
N the concept. The lexical field used to promote the BRI is similar: vague, positive, but 
C
E hollow. The BRI is often presented as an innocent and “inclusive” project, seeking “con-
P nectivity,” or “cooperation.” The Chinese vision, as represented in the media, is associated 
T to ideas like the “extended family” or a “global village,” working “hand in hand,” dialogue, 
S justice, peace, human progress, a rejection of  the Cold War mentality, a rejection of  hege-

monic tendencies, the defense of  “small” states, and other appealing ideas.
The first results of  a 2020 Google search which included the words “Belt and Road” 

and a Chinese media reporting on international news, like the Global Times, China Daily, or 
CGTN, illustrates the domination of  this positive rhetoric. The articles found are entitled: 

A
C the BRI “…best hope for globalization’s rebound,” “…route of  life and opportunity,” “…
T beacon for gloomy global recovery”; it “…helps build lasting economic and trade rela-
O tions,” “…boosts cultural exchanges, mutual understanding,” “…brings major benefits to 
R four continents,” and asks “…Why is it important to Europe?” and “…Why is not the BRI 
S a strategy of  China?”20

This propaganda, diffusing the image of  a beneficial-to-all, even altruistic, Chinese 
project, has proven fruitful for Beijing. Yet, the Chinese government does not hide its 
concrete intention: The Party-State wants to impose a new international order, with 
“Chinese characteristics,” that serves its interests. It does not just seek to replace the 

A US as head of  the current international system, but rather to become the leader of  a new 
C
T and different global order. Beijing is not satisfied with the current global order; it does 
I not ensure the safety of  its political regime nor does it recognize it as its “fair” value. The 
O Party does not only seek a world order in which its political regime can survive, it seeks a 
N
S world order in which its political regime is glorified.21 This is the ambition of  the “Chinese 

dream” for the “great national renaissance.” Only the creation of  the “community of  com-
mon destiny” could bring this “great national renaissance.”

The “community of  common destiny’s” propaganda campaign seeks to convince 
other states to adhere to the Chinese model, as an alternative to the Western lib-
eral model. It is presented as a superior, more efficient model that ensures economic 

C development while preserving political stability. Based on China’s “five millennia of  glo-
A rious civilization,” nearly “one century of  CCP rule,” and “forty years of  miraculous 
S development,” Xi Jinping asserts that China has the legitimacy and capacity to become

the leader of  the new world order and to ensure international security.22 In his speech at D

the 19th Congress, Xi Jinping defended the argument that “Chinese socialism […] blaz[es] C

N

preserving their independence; and it offers Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to

The Chinese congratulate themselves that their concept of  a “community of  C
common destiny” was used verbatim in multiple UN resolutions. They see it as O
evidence that Chinese ideas are gaining ground in the international community, which N
recognizes China’s position as a responsible world power.24 The UN now considers the C

E
BRI as a project aligned with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. And the P
UN secretary general personally promoted the BRI to other member states,25 incit- T
ing them to participate. The UN presents the initiative like Chinese propaganda does: a S
global development project rather than a Chinese influence strategy looking to build an 
international order based on CCP ideals.26 François Godement acknowledged that “even 
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, whose mission and mandate is far from 
the BRI’s objectives, felt the need to sign a memorandum of  action on the BRI with 
Beijing.”27 A

show the success of  the Chinese propaganda campaign. However, during the drafting of  
the document celebrating the 75th anniversary of  the United Nations in June 2020, the Five 
Eyes states and India refused the inclusion of  the term “community of  destiny” on the 
grounds that it would be an expression of  CCP ideology.28

Traditional Chinese culture, which is particularly well perceived in many countries N
(a wisdom that is more than a thousand years old, technical and scientific inventions and S
innovations, martial arts, graphic arts, ceramics, etc.), is now exploited by the Party. It has 
become a central component of  the Chinese narrative used to create a positive image of  
the country, and of  the political party leading it. The promotion of  traditional Chinese 
medicine abroad, and within international bodies, is a good example of  the Party’s narra-
tive strategy to expand its influence.

U A. The example of  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
C
T
I The Party initially focused on the recognition, by international organizations, of  
O
N the intrinsic value of  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This process occurred 

relatively quickly. In 2015, TCM was recognized in the medical world for the first time when 
Tu Youyou (屠呦呦) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for her research on the role of  

C the molecule Artemisinin, traditionally present in Chinese herbs, in the fight against malar-
O ia.29 When Xi Jinping became president, he initiated two strategies to promote the use of  
N
C TCM around the world: obtaining its recognition by the World Health Organization 
E (WHO) and integrating it into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
P
T
S 1. TCM and the WHO

The Chinese Margaret Chan was director general of  the WHO from 2006 to 2017. 
During her term, she promoted TCM within the organization. In 2016, she gave a speech 
praising Chinese medical advances, and traditional medicine in particular: “by mobilizing 
doctors, barefoot doctors, traditional practitioners, sanitary inspectors, and medical per-

A
C sonnel in factories, this country, despite its size, eradicated smallpox twenty years before 
T the rest of  the world. […] This feat gave China a reputation within the WHO: China can 
O accomplish anything it sets out to do.”30

R
S That same year, Xi Jinping forced local governments to praise and promote TCM 

within their health care systems.31 The following year, he visited the WHO for the first 
time, gifting the organization with a bronze statue representing acupunctural points,32 a 
symbol of  the Party’s desire to have the traditional practice recognized.

The CCP also took advantage of  the Covid-19 crisis to reinforce the legitimacy, 
recognition, and upholding the efficiency of  TCM abroad. After developing an entire 

A network of  TCM-affiliated hospitals as early as January 2020, to help prevent Covid-19,33 
C
T the CCP multiplied declarations on TCM’s efficiency in fighting the disease.34 On March 9, 
I 2020, Yu Yanhong (余艳红), deputy director of  the National Administration of  Traditional 
O Chinese Medicine, declared in a press conference that the majority of  the 50,000 cured 
N
S Covid-19 patients had benefited from a mixture of  TCM and Western medicine.35 For 

the Chinese administration, this was enough to prove the efficiency of  Covid-19. Chinese 
teams of  TCM experts were also deployed around the world to assist countries affected by 
Covid-19.36

The following month, the World Health Assembly (the decision-making body of  D
U

the WHO) included TCM in chapter 26 of  the organization’s 11th edition of  the C

Statistical Classification of  Diseases and Related Health Problems – ICD, which could be applica- T
I

ble to member countries by 2022.37 The ICD is the main document used by health actors O
N

because it allows them to compare the collection, analysis, and classification of  data inter-
nationally. China’s influence campaign hence succeeded.

The inclusion of  TCM in the ICD was controversial however; many health actors remain C
opposed to the decision. Much of  the criticism stems from the inconclusive results of  O
clinical trials, unable to determine the TCM’s efficiency. Some studies even suggested TCM N
could be dangerous.38 Many practitioners remain confused as to why the WHO shows C

E
leniency toward TCM (and China in general) (→ p. 213), given its goal of  imposing stricter P
health regulations. China’s recognition campaign is likely driven by its ambition to place T
Chinese actors on a huge global market and use TCM as a vector for Chinese influ- S
ence. In fact, the development of  TCM propagates a noble, wise, and benevolent image 
of  China.

In May 2020, the Healthy Sciences Authority of  Singapore authorized the pharmaceuti-
cal laboratory Yiling Pharmaceutical (石家庄以岭药业股份有限公司) to sell its Lianhua 
Qingwen capsules as a treatment for Covid-19. Seven other countries have allowed this A

C
treatment on their territory: Canada, Brazil, Thailand, Romania, Indonesia, Ecuador, and T
Mozambique.39 These advances can be tied to the international recognition of  Chinese uni- O
versity medical diplomas in June 2020. The next step will be the recognition of  academic R

S
specializations in the traditional medicine.40

While the promotion of  traditional medicine abroad is primarily done through seduc-
tion, domestic promotion can be more menacing. In June, a new municipal regulation in 
Beijing, pressed by the Party, declared that any defamation of  TCM could result in a 
lawsuit.41

In 2016, Xi Jinping announced a strategy for the development of  TCM42 that would O
guarantee universal access by 2020, and a flourishing industry by 2030. In addition to the N
development of  zones of  medical tourism, China wants to build at least 30 TCM cen- S

ters abroad. 17 have already been built in Hungary, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and the UAE.43 
China hopes to increase the use and adoption of  TCM in health services around the world,

III. Benevolence
Also falling under the category of  “seduce and subjugate” are China’s efforts to build 

an image as a benevolent power. This new position first led to the reappropriation of  
Confucian concepts – after the CCP had scorned the figure of  the sage for decades. The A
Party now draws its inspirations from the concepts of  ren (仁) and shu (恕). Ren is the C
affection one feels for one’s fellow man, what Anne Cheng called “the human sense”;51 it is T
as much a spontaneous feeling as a moral value which must be cultivated by way of  exam- I
ple. Being a model of  benevolence would therefore be at the heart of  China’s “mission.” O

N
The concept of  shu on the other hand refers to an idea of  benevolence more “abstract” S
and “universal” than ren.52 While some have seen similarities with agape, divine love for 
Christians, shu is exempt of  any divine dimension and is to be found in the reciprocity of  
human relations.53 

However, it is not always easy to distinguish in the Chinese strategy what is a sin-
cere belief  – that China’s foreign policy is part of  a more than millennia-old approach of  
benevolence and pacifism toward its neighbors as asserted by Li Anshan (李安山)54 – and C
what is a mere rhetoric of  covert domination, authoritarian paternalism, and a feel- A
ing of  civilizational superiority.55 S

O
D Beyond the positive image of  Confucius and his morality, which the Party tries to 
U
C embody, the construction of  the image of  a benevolent China also serves to discredit the 
T
I theory of  the “Chinese threat” which hinders the implementation of  the Party’s for-
O
N eign policy. To this end, the Party has promoted counter-narratives emphasizing China’s 

absolute pacifism and the harmless and beneficial nature of  its growing international foot-
print: this is particularly the case with the theory of  the peaceful rise56 “meant to reassure 

C Beijing’s partners by encouraging “engagement” strategies.”57

O This theory formally became a national strategy with the adoption of  white papers 
N in 200558 and in 2010.59 Proposed in 2003 by Zheng Bijan (郑必坚)60 – an intellectual figure 
C
E of  the Party that served in numerous structures including the Academy of  Social Sciences, 
P the Central Party School and the Department of  Propaganda– this theory maintains that 
T China is developing peacefully without threatening other powers, without looking for a 
S territorial expansion, and all of  this thanks to its labor and a peaceful international environ-

ment. This rhetoric has continued to be employed since Xi Jinping came to power,61 even 
though the use of  force is now a possible option in the event of  a threat against China’s 
interests.62 The central idea remains unchanged: to contradict all those who foresee an 
inevitable war between China and the United States (the famous “Thucydides trap”63) 

A
C and those who see the international system as a zero-sum game – i.e. the rise of  China 
T leading to an inevitable decline of  the United States. In its last Defense White Paper, which 
O is more of  a communication tool than a real doctrinal document, China presented itself  as 
R a leader in regional and global security. It also publicized its defense budget in it to prove its 
S efforts in terms of  transparency and explain that all its expenses are justified, which once 

again illustrated its desire to display itself  as a benevolent and responsible country.64 
The Party accompanies this narrative with meaningful actions that aspire to give sub-

stance to benevolence. The Peace Ark, also know under the name of  Daishan dao (岱山
岛), is one of  the most visible symbols of  Chinese benevolence manipulated by the 

A Party.

“Chinese Navy hospital ship Peace Ark (866) departs [U.S. base] Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam [in Hawaii] following the 
conclusion of  the Rim of  the Pacific 2016 military exercises” (U.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class 

Rebecca Wolfbrandt/RELEASED – public domain).

This hospital ship of  the PLA South Sea Fleet naval forces has undertaken a dozen human-
itarian missions and cared for around 180,000 patients around the world since its commis- A

C
sioning in 2008. These missions allow China to assume the best intentions and “conquer T
the hearts” of  local populations who benefit from free health care. Chinese media regu- O
larly report on the “achievements” of  Peace Ark sailors, for example the Bangladeshi patient R
who gave birth to her baby on the ship and decided to name her daughter “Ciin” – “China” S

in Bengali – as a tribute to the team which had taken care of  her; as for the newborn, she 
was quickly erected as “a symbol of  the friendship between China and Bangladesh.”65 The 
Peace Ark also engages in cultural exchanges with local populations to reinforce the “con-
nections of  friendship” between peoples and thus serve as an instrument of  public diplo-
macy to create economic opportunities and enlarge the influence of  the country.66 Several A
countries, like Fiji and Tonga have praised these missions.67 The Chinese navy’s hospital C

T
ship actually kills three birds with one stone: it not only improve the image of  China I
(generous, humanitarian) but also discredit local governments (China is helping you O
because your government is incompetent) and scout to find out where they can go with N

S
large ships (to potentially military ends).

Finally, China has a development aid program to present itself  to the world as a benev-
olent power. At the 2018 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), Xi Jinping prom-
ised $60 billion in aid to African countries. The Chinese government reportedly funded 
more than three thousand projects between 2000 and 2014, worth more than $270 billion.68 
Even if  the promises are not always followed by action, and a significant part of  the “dona- C
tions” are actually loans,69 this rhetoric presenting China at the bedside of  the devel- A
oping world allows the Party to portray itself  as a benevolent country. S

P
T
S Seduction cannot only rest on the Chinese “model,” tradition and benevolence. These 

qualities make it possible to appeal to a certain part of  the international public but they are 
not enough to establish its ability to influence actors. This is why Beijing also relies on the 
image of  power. For the last two decades, we can even say that it has been the main 
driving force behind Chinese seduction. In this respect, it is quite significant to note 

A that the curve for the number of  Chinese language learners is very strongly correlated with 
C that of  the development of  this image of  power: Chinese language learners admit to being 
T
O mainly motivated by commercial prospects that they imagine to be monumental. 
R The Party wants to acquire all of  the attributes of  power to signify to the world that this 
S is now China’s status. This strategy is carried out through a narrative, and even more so, 

through an image of  this power that must, moreover, be variagated; because the Party admits 
no weakness, China must be the embodiment of  power in all domains. Evidently, 
military power,70 which is expressed nowhere better than in the military parades – whose 
pageantry is just as good as that of  the Soviet Union – an undeniable element but always 

A liable to disrupt the message of  peace and benevolence that the Party wishes to carry. This 
C is why Beijing also relies on other images of  power capable of  fascinating without giving

Visually, the image of  power is foremostly reflected in architectural achieve-
ments. The promotion of  the architectural heritage of  China –the Great Wall and the 
Forbidden City are undoubtedly the best-known symbols in this case – reminds us that, 
historically, China has always been a refined and powerful country. And more modern

Beijing National Center for the Performing Arts, also called “Peking Opera” (国家大剧 D
U

Paul Andreu, the center is covered by an elliptically shaped titanium and glass dome, which T
I

appears to be delicately laid on water formed by the artificial lake that surrounds it. O
N

Many other architectural projects have been showcased for their beauty, their original-
ity or their technological feats, and they are used by the media as symbols of  the Chinese 
power. These include the Beijing National Stadium (北京国家体育场) – nicknamed “the C
Bird’s Nest” (鸟巢) – built for the 2008 Olympic Games, the CCTV headquarters with O
its unusual shape, the Huoshenshan hospital in Wuhan built in ten days to cope with the N
Covid-19 pandemic,71 or even the many skyscrapers that have multiplied in the country; five C

E
of  them are among the ten highest buildings in the world. 72 P

China also promotes its scientific and technological achievements, some of  which T
are visually striking and conducive to media coverage. This is the case for example of  the S
spherical radio telescope with an opening of  500 meters that was built in a crevasse in Wuxi, 
in Jiangsui, which is the largest of  its kind, the most sensitive in the world and whose aerial 
photos have quickly spread around the planet.73 The many transport infrastructures that 
have broken records are also easy to “publicize”: the bridge connecting Hong Kong, Macao 
and Zhuhai (Guangdong province), which is the longest maritime bridge in the world;74 the A

C
Beipanjiang Bridge in Guizhou province which crosses the highest precipice (565 meters);75 T
the railway line that connects the Tibetan plateau to the rest of  China, while breaking O
altitude records (4,500 meters);76 or the Fuxing bullet train77 and the magnetic levitation R

S
“Shanghai Transrapid” (Maglev), which are among the fastest trains in the world.

Achievements in the space sector are also widely publicized to 
reinforce the image of  a technologically advanced China and to stir 
up feelings of  national pride. To name a few recent examples, China 
was the first to put a quantum satellite, the Micius, into orbit in 
2016;78 the first to successfully land an exploration module, the A
Chang’e-4, on the far side of  the moon in 2019;79 it finalized its C

T
global coverage satellite positioning system, BeiDou, a competitor to I
American GPS and Galileo in 2020 (→ p. 135);80 in July 2020 it sent O

its first probe to Mars, Tianwen-1, which, if  successful, would be the first mission to achieve N
S

this feat.81 As the image of  power is synonymous with cutting edge technologies,

INFILTRATE AND COERCE I
O
N

C
O
N
C
E

The first category of  operations focuses on discursive strategies that rely on the pro- P
duction and dissemination of  positive narratives about China, in order to shape foreign T

S
perceptions and eliminate potential threats to the Party. This first category is not mere 
propaganda, but is already part of  the repertoire of  active measures (→ p. 33). As we have 
seen, these speeches are not only disseminated by the Party’s own means, but also through 
local intermediaries who act as propaganda “whitewashers,” masking the true source of  the 
narrative.1 What also characterizes the operations in the first category is that they call for A
voluntary local support, whose motivations are not always altruistic. C

The second category consists of  “stronger” operations that do not try to seduce the T
adversary, but rather, to make it bend. Two types of  tools must be distinguished in this O

R
category: infiltration and coercion. To infiltrate (from the Latin filtrum, “filter”) refers to S
the idea of  “gradually penetrating” a society or a government to influence decision-making 
mechanisms. To coerce (from the Latin constringere which means “tighten with” or “tighten 
against”) is to impose something on someone against their will, through the use of  threats, 
intimidation, blackmail, or other forms of  pressure. 

In the first case, these are infiltration operations which aim to slowly penetrate adverse 
A

societies in order to hinder any possible action against the Party’s interest. These operations C
take extremely varied forms according to the nature of  the “threat” and are deployed simul- T
taneously in several sectors in order to circumscribe the targets: diasporas, media outlets, I
diplomacy, the economy, politics, education, think tanks, culture, and so on. O

N
In the second case, we speak of  “punitive”2 or “coercive”3 diplomacy. Originally, the S

CCP used it only to defend its fundamental interests (核心利益). Yang Jiechi (杨洁篪), 
China’s foreign policy coordinator, recalled that, for the CCP this notion included “issues 
concerning Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang.”4 On these subjects the Party does not 
tolerate any interference and will draw from the repertoire of  coercive diplomatic actions 
to prevent a state from maintaining relations of  any kind with Taiwan or to prohibit a head

1. Some authors consider that the dissemination of  misleading information falls within the scope of  active S
measures, but we, for our part, consider that the element of  concealment or, at the very least, of  obfuscation on the E
part of  the sponsor is an essential dimension that makes it possible to distinguish propaganda from active measures.

guerre et la paix. Approches et enjeux de la sécurité et de la stratégie (Paris: Presses de Sciences Po, 2020), 136-150. The concept 
of  “coercive diplomacy” was theorized in: Alexander George, Forceful Persuasion: Coercive Diplomacy as an Alternative 
to War (Washington DC: US Institute of  Peace Press, 1991). It was often applied to China, for example by: Fergus C

U

O
N cive diplomacy has been directed at an increasing number and variety of  issues, so much 

so that a simple speech that could be interpreted as the beginning of  a criticism and as a

T (中 南大学)5 who supports China’s unilateral sanctions, or the CICIR, a think tank of  the 
S MSS – because they all defend the implementation of  Chinese economic sanctions against 

anyone who threatens its interests.6 State media accept and help diffuse this policy of  sys-
tematic sanctions; hoping to establish a form of  deterrence, as illustrated by the reaction of  
the Global Times’ editor-in-chief  to a call of  some British MPs to boycott the 2022 Winter 
Olympics in Beijing (see screenshot below).7

Craft John R. Bolton and Stephen K. Bannon). These “anti-Chinese American politicians” C

were accused of  having “seriously violated the country’s sovereignty” and were deemed T
I

“responsible for a series of  foolish American actions on issues related to China.”8 They O
N

and their immediate family members are now prohibited from entering Chinese territories 
and doing business with China. The announcement of  these sanctions in the midst of  
Washington’s political transition is a way for Beijing to kill two birds with one stone: pun- C
ish the Trump administration and warn the Biden administration. It sent a message O
to the new U.S. president’s entourage that those who pursue anti-CCP policies will have a N
hard time being recruited by U.S. businesses when they leave the administration (as most C

E
of  them have interests in China). Here, Beijing skillfully exploited the vulnerabilities of  the P
U.S. revolving doors system. T

If  the scope has worryingly widened, as a number of  states have recently realized, Evan S
Feigenbaum noted nevertheless that the CCP has not yet established a hierarchy in its 
response that would specify the actions likely to be taken, from the most limited to the most 
coercive.9 The type of  response that Beijing will use remains thus relatively uncertain, even 
if  experience seems to show an increasingly multifaceted use of  coercion. The Party 
adapts its response to the local reality by identifying the weaknesses of  target countries. The A

C
vagueness maintained by Beijing could stem from a hesitation over the approach or from T
the desire to dissuade its opponents from any action, as the nature of  the Chinese reaction O
remains unknown to them. The idea being that more is often achieved when the thresh- R

S
old of  intolerance is not clearly defined.

One of  the most evident manifestations of  coercion is retaliation, which Beijing prac-
tices extensively as we will see in this chapter and in the case studies. States, companies, 
and individuals who criticize or oppose the CCP are targeted by all kinds of  diplomatic 
or trade sanctions (such as those currently imposed on Australia): expulsions from the 
Chinese market, including some targeting artists (Beijing canceled contracts with South A
Korean actors and singers as a retaliation against the THAAD) and cultural products (radio C

T
stations in Beijing have been ordered to stop broadcasting Swedish music). Imposing a I
financial cost can also be accomplished by reducing the number of  Chinese tourists and O
students on which some countries depend (→ p. 405 and 271), or by refraining from broad- N

S
casting NBA games to punish one of  its leaders for his critical comments (→ p. 250), for 
example. It can also mean legal actions (lawfare → p. 53); refusing visas (some Swedes 
who were refused Chinese visas were told that it was because of  Stockholm’s attitude, for 
which China demanded a change); the disclosure of  personal data to assist in the online 
harassment of  certain people (notably pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong → p. 397); 
cyber-attacks, intimidation, even physical attacks and kidnappings (Beijing, like some pariah C
states, practices a “hostage diplomacy” → p. 411), etc. A

The CCP uses an incredibly wide range of  retaliatory measures, in all domains S
and against all actors. An ASPI report studying 152 cases that affected 27 countries as E

well as the EU between 2010 and 2020, noted “a sharp escalation in these tactics since 
2018.”10

O

tages as Matt Schrader reminded us: not only are the intermediaries force multipliers but the 
fact that the relationship with the Party-State is not often assumed – that they may “plau-

I. The Diasporas D
U
C
T

According to the official Chinese media, there are between 40 and more than 60 million I
O

“overseas Chinese” (海外华人, OCs).12-13 The estimate contrasts with that of  the U.S. N

Census Bureau (nearly 10 million).14 In fact, it all depends on the reach given to the term, 
whether it refers to citizenship or, as Beijing does, descent. In any case, according to a U.N. 
estimate, the number presumably doubled between 1990 and 2017.15 They have settled in C
around 180 countries, and more than 80% of  these “Chinese” have taken the citizenship O
of  their host country.16 N

C
Overseas Chinese, the overwhelming majority of  whom live in countries freer than E

China, have the particularity of  having access to many uncensored sources of  informa- P
tion. They are thus constantly exposed to criticism of  the CCP, and even to the outright T

S
hostility of  certain communities, including the famous “five poisons” and certain foreign 
governments. From Beijing’s point of  view, this population is a danger because, on 
the one hand, it is harder to reach and more exposed to negative influence and, on 
the other, it is likely to return to China or simply communicate with (and thus influ-
ence) relatives who remain in China. It is therefore logically one of  its priority targets in A
its influence efforts. The objective of  the Party is twofold: to control these diasporas C
so that they do not represent a threat to the ruling power, but also to mobilize them T
to serve its interests. O

R
S

A. Ethnic Nationalism 

In its broadest definition, the Chinese diasporas – the plural is justified given their het-
erogeneity – are composed of  the Huaqiao (华侨) i.e. Chinese nationals (Hong Kong, 
Macanese and Taiwanese nationals are included from Beijing’s point of  view) who live or A
stay abroad; the Huaren (华人), who have abandoned their Chinese passport and obtained C

T
the nationality of  their country of  residence; and the Huayi (华裔), the descendants of  I
Chinese born abroad.17 From Beijing’s point of  view, all are “Chinese” “sons and daughters O
of  the motherland,” regardless of  their citizenship status.18 Originally, Beijing drew a rela- N

S
tively clear distinction between them, particularly the Huaqiao and the Huaren, but – “espe-
cially under Xi Jinping’s vision of  the “one big China Family” and his project of  a great 
rejuvenation of  the Chinese nation” – the line of  demarcation has tended to become more 
blurry.19

13. Since China does not have overseas territories, it is preferable to speak of  overseas Chinese (OCs) to refer to S

Chinese residing abroad or of  Chinese descent. One could speak of  “foreign Chinese” but this would not be a literal E
translation of  the Chinese term. On this point, see the work of  Pierre Trolliet in particular.

D The goal is to blur the line between Chinese nationals and overseas Chinese and 
U
C to create and maintain a sense of  belonging to the same nation by homogenizing 
T
I very heterogeneous communities, including in their relation with China, since a large 
O
N part of  these “Chinese” claimed by Beijing are dissidents who fled the regime, particularly 

after Tian’anmen, who come from elsewhere (Hong Kong or Taiwan), or who are the 
descendants of  immigrants. Sometimes they no longer have any ties to the country, the lan-

C guage, or the culture of  their ancestors. But it is by mixing as much as possible these diverse 
O trajectories that Beijing tries to establish – or even artificially manufactures – a “Chinese 
N community” in a given country to generate a sense of  pro-Chinese identity. Most of  the 
C
E time, this creates a significant gap in perception between the way Beijing sees “the” Chinese 
P community in Thailand, for example, or in Canada, and the Chinese Thai and Chinese 
T Canadians who do not feel that they belong to a defined Chinese community. This can lead 
S to odd situations, such as that anecdote reported by a Chinese-American member of  the 

U.S. Air Force. During a banquet with a Chinese delegation, he was toasted by the head of  
the delegation, a senior general in the PLA air force, who invited him to “remember that 
blood is thicker than water. Chinese blood runs through you. You understand us, and know 
that no matter what flag you wear on your shoulders, you are Chinese first and foremost.”20 

A
C This episode is a reminder that the most likely targets of  Chinese influence operations, 
T whether based on seduction or coercion, are first and foremost those who are consid-
O ered by Beijing to be ethnically Chinese. The experts at the RAND Corporation, in 
R a report commissioned by the U.S. Air Force, are therefore right to believe that “one of  
S China’s first targets of  disinformation on social media will be ethnic Chinese U.S. military 

officers and service members” – not only on social networks but also in the physical world, 
through various means.21 

This vision based on “blood” is symptomatic of  the fact that the Chinese foreign policy, 
especially its actions against those considered as “overseas Chinese”, is first and foremost an 

A identity policy, and an ethnic nationalism which is also reflected in the integration of  the 
C
T Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO) into the United Front Work Department in 2018 
I (→ p. 168), and in initiatives such as the Conference on Dialogue of  Asian Civilizations in 
O Beijing in May 2019.22

B. The largest campaign of  transnational repression in the world 

The first priority for the Party-State is to ensure that these diasporas – which by defi-
nition include many dissidents and opponents who have fled China, or simply people 
who grew up in a liberal environment critical of  the Chinese communist regime – do not 

C pose a threat. Its main targets in this regard are ethnic and religious minorities, particularly 
A
S Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongols (from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) and Falun 
E Gong followers, but also Taiwanese independence fighters, political opponents, and pro-de-

mocracy activists, including Hong Kong nationals (who, since 2019, have been the focus of  
particular attention), human rights defenders, journalists, and former officials wanted for

“corruption.” Against these categories of  “overseas Chinese,” Beijing is deploying a cam- D
U

paign of  transnational repression which, according to the NGO Freedom House, C

is “the most sophisticated, global and comprehensive campaign of  transnational T
I

repression in the world.”23 Concretely, it includes monitoring these communities and O
N

individuals, regardless of  their citizenship (since the Party-State has an ethnic approach), 
to identify and infiltrate them, maintain constant pressure on them, intimidate, 
threaten, harass, and coerce them, one way or another, or even to physically assault C
them (no less than 214 cases recorded by Freedom House between 2014 and 2020). It also O
involves putting pressure on the states where they reside to have them arrested and pos- N
sibly extradited (which happened in India, Thailand, Serbia, Malaysia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, C

E
UAE, Turkey and Nepal at least).24 P

The case studies in Part 4, particularly Sweden (→ p. 521) and Canada (→ p. 539) pro- T
vide specific examples of  the tactics employed, which range from death threats, or rape, S
to physical assault, and include cyber-attacks, pressures on family or relatives still in China, 
travel restrictions (confiscated passports, revoked visas), surveillance, searches, harassment 
campaigns on social networks, and so on.

Women victims of  particularly virulent hate campaigns C

T
A somewhat visible voice that is critical of  the Party is systematically targeted by a more-or-less O
organized campaign of  hatred. Those “ethnically” Chinese, whatever their citizenship, suffer R
from attacks all the more violent as they are perceived as “traitors.” Among them, women are S
subjected to particularly violent insults. 
Vicky Xu, an Australian journalist of  Chinese origin, has been the subject of  an online ha-
rassment campaign since she published an ASPI report on the repression of  the Uyghurs in 
March 2020.25 Insulted daily on social networks, she has been called “a race traitor,” “a fe-
male Han traitor,” “a female demon,” and “a slut”26 “bewitched by the anti-China forces in 
the West,” according to the Global Times, which quoted one of  her alleged former classmates 
at the University of  Melbourne (describing her as “a person who pursues personal interests by A
selling out her own country”).27 A video uploaded on YouTube – but deleted since – speculat- C
ed on her obviously-unrestrained sexual life28 (that she presumably “has sex simultaneously T
with 15 men and doesn’t pay”29). She received death threats (an Internet user insisted on the I
need to “kill a traitor”30), while some of  her colleagues received rape threats and others were O
detained and interrogated in China.31 N
Tzu-I Chuang, the Taiwanese wife of  an American diplomat (a consul general at Chengdu) S
was also targeted by a campaign of  online hatred in July 2020. For instance, one social network 
user mentioned her 7- and 9-year-old sons: “I hope your two little dogs get bitten to 
death and knocked down by a car.” Trolls have released pictures of  her home in Maryland 
(where the family was repatriated due to the Covid-19 crisis), of  her family and herself  to 
ridicule them. Several pro-Beijing Taiwanese and Hong Kong newspapers published articles 
hypothesizing that she was a prostitute paid by the Taiwanese government to harvest

C. The mobilization of  the diasporas to serve the Party’s interests 
A
C Diasporas are not only a potential threat to the Party-State: they are also an opportu-
T nity, a powerful relay to defend its interests around the world. As such, various actors are 
I in charge of  “diasporic affairs” (华侨事务 工作), including the former Overseas Chinese 
O
N Affairs Office (OCAO), which now reports to the UFWD, but also the ministries of  Foreign 
S Affairs, Education, and State Security.

Chinese diasporas can bring many benefits to the Party. Located abroad, OCs can serve 
as promoters of  Chinese soft power: they are in the best position to disseminate the 
Chinese culture to the communities whose codes they have adopted. They can play 
the role of  a “vanguard” or at least a “bridge” between China and their countries of  resi-
dence to improve mutual understanding and even promote the PRC’s diplomatic and eco-

C nomic objectives.34 The PRC can also benefit from their knowledge of  their countries 
A of  residence to better understand the local political systems and decipher current events.35 
S This is all the more feasible as OCs are increasingly able to secure a high social status in 
E

their respective countries in various fields such as trade, scientific research, and politics.
However, more than mere facilitators of  exchanges between China and other countries, 

OCs can be instrumentalized by the PRC for political purposes to influence their

local political life. This is thus a form of  interference. In a book based on his PhD thesis D
U

on extraterritorial policies toward OCs, James Jiann Hua To cited, for example, the case of  C

the unofficial protection of  the PLA granted by Beijing to members of  the Chinese dias- T
I

pora in the United States for their commercial interests, in exchange for channeling funds O
N

for Democratic Party election campaigns during the Clinton era.36 The investigation into 
illegal and improper activities in connection with the 1996 federal election by the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs identified at least six individuals involved in these C
donations who allegedly had some direct connection with the PRC, including John Huang, O
Maria Hsia and Yah Lin “Charlie” Trie.37 The PRC can also organize, notably through N
United Front organizations, the mobilizations of  OCs in support of  China’s interests, such C

E
as what the Council for the Promotion of  the Peaceful Reunification of  China (CPPRC, P
中国和平统一促进会) does on behalf  of  the reunification with Taiwan (→ p. 124), or T
to protest against topics that anger Beijing, such as the Dalai Lama’s visits abroad, for S
which the Chinese Students and Scholars Associations (CSSAs, 中国学生学者联合会) 
have repeatedly mobilized Chinese students (→ p. 280).38 To hinder a rally in support of  
Hong Kong, on August 23, 2019, the Chinese Embassy in Lithuania, in coordination with 
the Chinese intelligence services, organized a counter-demonstration in Vilnius; a majority 
of  the participants were members of  the Association of  Chinese Expatriates in Lithuania.39 A

Chinese embassy involved in counter-protests in Lithuania S

On August 23, 2019, as hundreds of  Lithuanians formed a human chain in solidarity with the 
Hong Kong protesters (several tens of  thousands of  people were doing the same thing at the 
same time in Hong Kong), pro-Beijing activists burst in and disrupted the chain by shouting 
“Hong Kong is part of  China.” The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry established that “the staff  
of  the Embassy of  the People’s Republic of  China were involved in organizing the un-
lawful actions undertaken by the Chinese citizens during this incident.” The ambassador A
himself, Shen Zhifei (申知非), was seen at the protest, where he was observing and “direct- C
ing” the counter-protesters. The Ministry of  Foreign Affairs is also said to be relying informa- T
tion from the Department of  State Security regarding “the role the PRC Embassy performed I
in the organization, or coordination of  the counterprotest.”40 It would be a first example of  O
Chinese interference in a demonstration in Lithuania. N

In countries where OCs also represent a significant portion of  the electorate, managing 
to influence them to vote for candidates who are favored by the Party is another form

Canada at age 18, and who had presented himself  as wanting to serve as a “bridge” between 
the two countries, having not forgotten his origins (→ p. 557).43 In 2017, the election of  

C two Italian deputies of  Chinese origins, but perfectly integrated into the local political cul-
O ture, was celebrated by the Chinese media as a “victory for China’s participation in Italian 
N political life.”44
C
E In order to persuade the diaspora and push it into action, the Party uses more or less 
P “soft”45 methods of  cooptation. Sometimes it is enough to appeal to the sense of  
T national or ethnic pride, of  love for the motherland to seduce some of  them, includ-
S ing those who have abandoned their Chinese passport and those who never had it. The 

“diplomacy of  assistance” consists in assisting the Huaren and Huayi as much as the 
Huaqiao. The PRC has adopted this approach particularly since the 1998 riots in Indonesia 
that claimed the lives of  over a thousand ethnically Chinese people.46 This diplomacy aims 
to maintain a sense of  belonging to the same nation across all members of  the diaspora. 

A
C Scholarships to come and study in China, exchange programs with high schools 
T and universities abroad, but also all “back to your roots” summer camps (寻根之
O 旅), open to all Huayi, show that the PRC is ready to invest in the long term to build this 
R sense of  belonging into the future generations.47
S Religion is another powerful vector of  influence on the diaspora, many members of  

which have converted to Christianity.48 The PRC seeks to infiltrate these religious groups to 
influence and mobilize OCs who are more likely to be receptive in these circles of  sociabil-
ity.49 Financial incentive-such as the promise of  a job or a house-is obviously another 
lever used to persuade, as are intimidations and even threats.50 For example, MSS agents 

A have reportedly forced OCs to cooperate by threatening not to grant or renew visas, to 
C
T attack their relatives residing in China, or to consider them subjects of  Chinese law even if  
I they hold a passport of  another nationality.51 
O Beijing also knows how to use traditional media to reach Chinese diasporas. In France, 
N
S the embassy uses the Mandarin TV channel, which is a real source of  transmission for the 

Party’s official discourse toward the Chinese diaspora in France. On March 14, 2020, for 
example, the Chinese ambassador in Paris, Lu Shaye (→ p. 235) spoke on the channel and 
accused the French media of  malice and of  using “propaganda” methods to inflict “real 
brainwashing” on public opinion. The ambassador criticized the biased treatment by the 
French media of  the coronavirus crisis in China.52

In France, the Association pour la paix et la réunification de la Chine (Association D

I

in France.53 It is now headed by Wang Jiaqing (王加清), its executive director, and by Yang O
N

Ming (杨明), its president. As the organizer of  the promotional association, Yang Ming 
lent his business premises for the inaugural festivities: 78 associations were invited.54 The 
purpose of  the Association is to unite all Chinese throughout the world who support the C
reunification of  China and oppose the independence of  Taiwan.55 To this end, it organizes O
seminars and visits that showcase the Chinese culture.56 It also maintains important links N
with other Franco-Chinese associations. Ultimately, it is supervised by the Chinese Embassy C

E
in France, the consular department, and by the Chinese Council for the Promotion of  P
Peaceful Reunification (中国和平统一促进会), which is its parent association.57 T

The mobilization of  the Chinese diaspora in France was completed by the creation, on S
July 14, 2020, of  the Association of  Chinese Writers in France (AECF), whose stated goal 
is to “coordinate activities between members and associated institutions and to promote 
the development of  literary activities; to develop exchanges between Chinese and French 
literary circles.”58 The association, based in L’Haÿ-les-Roses, is chaired by Liang Yuanfa (梁

U II. The Media 
C
T
I “To shape media content and narratives around the world, affecting every region and 
O
N multiple languages,” Beijing uses a combination of  “widely accepted forms of  public diplo-

macy with more covert, corrupt, and coercive activities that undermine democratic norms, 
reduce national sovereignty, weaken the financial sustainability of  independent media, and 

C violate the laws of  some countries,” wrote Freedom House.61 

O Since the mid-2000s, the Chinese authorities have been trying to raise the profile of  
N
C some of  their “news” organizations to the level of  the largest international media with a 
E global influence, in order to make the Chinese vision of  current affairs heard. The turn-
P ing point came in 2008: as it noted the uncontrolled communication around the Beijing 
T
S Olympic Games, which “just as much served as a sounding board for the regime’s oppo-

nents,” Beijing drafted a ten-year plan to better control its image in the world and, to 
this end, invested “10 billion RMB (€1.3 billion per year).”62 Over the past decade, the 
CCP has thus made unprecedented efforts to establish “a new world media order,” to use 
the expression coined by Li Congjun, the former president of  Xinhua and now a member 

A of  the Party’s Central Committee.63 RSF noted that, “in his speeches, Li Congjun (李从军) 
C constantly uses such terms as ‘media industry’ and ‘mass communications’ but has never 
T used the word ‘journalism.’ This is not insignificant. By treating the media as an industry 
O
R whose mission is to exercise influence on the state’s behalf, his ‘new world media order’ 
S abolishes the watchdog role the media are meant to play.”64 Indeed, official press releases 

mention “media workers” rather than “journalists” – including, which is telling of  this 
paradox, for the members of  the All-China Journalists Association (ACJA).65

The Xinhua news agency, the CCTV television network, the China Daily newspaper, 
the Global Times and China Radio International (CRI) are among the first media organiza-
tions to have benefited from government support for their international development. In 

A
C February 2016, after visiting the three main Chinese media organizations in Beijing (People’s 
T Daily, Xinhua, and CCTV), Xi Jinping chaired a symposium of  around 180 representatives 
I of  state media who were instructed to strictly follow the CCP’s instructions and focus on 
O
N the “positive coverage” of  the country. “All news media run by the party must work to 
S speak for the party’s will and its propositions, and protect the party’s authority and unity,” 

he declared.66

These major outlets have gradually multiplied their foreign-language content, developed C

T
branches abroad, established partnerships with foreign media and recruited local journalists O
to better convey their message to different audiences. As such, Chinese media greatly R
benefit from the asymmetry that characterizes the relationship between an autoc- S

racy and democracies, as RSF reminded us: “The values of  tolerance and openness that 
characterize liberal democracies give Beijing considerable freedom of  movement, for which 
nothing is demanded in return. The asymmetry is striking. The state news agency Xinhua 
plans to have opened 200 bureaux around the world by 2020 but Beijing is extremely spar-
ing in the accreditations it gives to foreign reporters. State-owned China Global Television A
Network (CGTN) is extending its influence in more than 100 countries but international C
TV channels and radio stations such as France’s TV5, America’s VOA and the UK’s BBC T

I
are banned in China outside luxury hotels.”68 O

In addition to using these major media outlets to project itself  in the world, Beijing N
is influencing local media in a growing number of  countries, starting with those host- S

ing the largest diasporas, with tactics that have long been well-known. In the American case, 
for example, it was found as early as in 2001 that “[four] main tactics characterize the Chinese 
government’s effort to influence Chinese media in America. First is the attempt to directly con-
trol newspapers, television stations, and radio stations through complete ownership or owning 
major shares. Second is the government’s use of  economic ties to influence independent media 
who have business relations with China. This leverage has had major effects on the content C

A
of  broadcasting and publishing, effectively removing all material deemed “unfavorable” by S
the Chinese government. Third is the purchasing of  broadcast time and advertising space (or E
more) from existing independent media. Closely related to this is the government’s providing 
free, ready-to-go programming and content. Fourth is the deployment of  government person-
nel to work in independent media, achieving influence from within their ranks.”69

S the China Media Group (CMG), nicknamed “Voice of  China” and subordinate to the State 

Council. CMG will soon open an “imposing office” in Brussels, in addition to the eight 
others it already has elsewhere in the world, and in December 2020, the group advertised 
264 new positions, 82 of  which are dedicated to “international propaganda.”73

A These media’s approach for their international development is always the same: the dif-
C fusion of  their products abroad is facilitated by the establishment of  local offices and the 
T recruitment of  local journalists, the content is calibrated to local news, communi-
O cation formats (text, image, video, audio) and media (paper, radio, television, Internet) are 
R
S diversified, with an emphasis on the presence on social networks and formats adapted 

to cell phone screens in order to reach a wider audience, more directly. The website “China 
Internet Information Center” (china.com.cn or china.org.cn) is an example of  a platform 
specifically dedicated to an international audience seeking to establish itself  as a reference 
news website on China.

Chinese media have difficulties generating as much appeal as mainstream Western media 
A
C however. Many viewers, listeners, and readers of  foreign-language content are Chinese 
T who wish to improve their English. Despite the efforts made to rebrand and to promote 
I themselves as independent media, the lack of  credibility of  the information presented 
O
N and the propagandistic tone of  the Chinese media undoubtedly play a key role in 
S their difficulties to compete with Western media and to establish themselves on the 

global market.

1. Xinhua 

Xinhua is one of  the largest news agencies in the world. Based in Beijing, it manages 
C more than 30 national branches and some 180 overseas offices in more than 100 countries. 
A It is one of  the Party’s largest and oldest news agencies. Created in 1931 under the name 
S “Red China News Agency” (红色中华通讯社), it changed its name to Xinhua in 1937, 
E which is literally “New China.” Its first foreign broadcast of  an English program dates back

to 1944 and the establishment of  its first overseas branch in 1948. Today, Xinhua covers D
U

Asia, North America, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and offers content in a C

dozen languages – including English, French, Arabic, Russian, German, Portuguese and T
I

Tibetan – on topics ranging from politics, economics and international relations to culture, O
N

health and sports. The agency also publishes some two dozen newspapers and magazines, 
including Reference News (参考消息) which is one of  the most widely distributed news-
papers in the world and is the most distributed newspaper in China. In the same logic of  C
multiplying communication formats to broaden its audience, Xinhua has also developed its O
own television channel, China Xinhua News Network Corporation (CNC), offering con- N
tent in Chinese and English, and broadcasting 24/7 in different countries around the world. C

E
The agency also sought to develop videos for phones, a format more suited to directly P
reach social network users. Its website, xinhuanet.com, is one of  China’s most important T
information platforms available in a dozen foreign languages. S

Under the direct supervision of  the State Council, Xinhua relays information 
and the propaganda designed by the Party. For two years, between 1980 and 1982, the 
agency was incidentally under the authority of  the Propaganda Department. The arrival of  
Xi Jinping was also perceived by Xinhua’s journalists as marking the entry into a new era 
in which the Chinese media “should no longer be ashamed of  being communist media.”74 A

C
The agency aims to establish itself  as a world leader in the sector and to be able to com- T

pete with major media outlets such as CNN, Bloomberg, AP, AFP, and Al Jazeera, in order O
to bring the voice of  China abroad and present its “true” nature to the rest of  the world. In R

S
2010, Xinhua signed a 20-year contract to set up its premises in Times Square in New York; 
all the more symbolic of  its internationalization is the gigantic 18 x 12 meter LED screen it 
rents there with the brand’s logo.75 Eventually, the goal is to turn Xinhua into a conglomer-
ate comparable to News Corp, Viacom or Time Warner. In March 2021, the “China Xinhua 
News” account was followed by more than 12 million users on Twitter and more than 89 
million on Facebook – probably artificially-inflated figures as we will see (→ p. 182). In A
order to better adapt its content to foreign audiences, the agency does not hesitate to recruit C

T
local staff  members who are fluent in the language and cultural codes.76 Local “journal- I
ists” are generally only tasked with translating dispatches (稿子) previously written O
by Chinese employees. In the case of  Xinhua’s broadcasts in French, 80% of  the dis- N

S
patches are translations from English and the remaining 20% from Chinese.77 Xinhua has 
a specific service for the administration of  foreign journalists: The State Administration 
of  Foreign Experts Affairs. The dispatches translated, and more rarely written, by French 
journalists are all proofread by an experienced Chinese journalist who speaks fluent French 
and is familiar with the Party’s expectations as well as with its “preferred stories.”78

The agency’s partnerships with several UN international organizations, including C
UNESCO, UNEP, UNICEF, UNAIDS, FAO, and UNDP, serve to strengthen its legitimacy A
and trustworthiness in the eyes of  the international audience.79 The former FAO Director S

O
N strategic shift is notably reflected in the multiplication of  training offers for media profes-

sionals on the continent (→ p. 202). 

C 2. CCTV/CGTN
O
N Another Chinese media organization that has also been given the mission to compete 
C with major international media outlets is China Central Television (CCTV). This situation 
E
P has incidentally created tensions between the media groups CCTV and Xinhua. CCTV is 
T the main network of  public television channels in China. Beijing TV was established 
S in 1958 and changed its name to CCTV in 1978. Today, CCTV operates about 40 channels 

and it is owned by the China Media Group, since 2018, which is itself  under the authority 
of  the State Council. CCTV’s international development has unfolded gradually. In 1992, 
CCTV broadcast its first Mandarin-language program abroad to the diaspora. Its first news 
channel entirely in English, CCTV-9, was launched in 2000. By signing an agreement with 

A News Corp in 2002, CCTV ensured its presence on American cable. From 2004 to 2010, 
C
T five other channels in French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian and Portuguese were launched. And 
O with a production center set up in Nairobi in 2012, CCTV intended to increase its audience 
R in Africa, which is becoming a new target for Chinese media (→ p. 202). Two other produc-
S tion centers are also being developed in London and Washington DC, the latter becoming 

the main center for processing and disseminating information around the world.
CCTV wants to differentiate itself  from Xinhua by changing its tone and offering 

content that looks less manifestly like state propaganda. The objective is, once again, 
to succeed in imposing the “good” image of  China abroad and to “correct” the misrep-

A resentation to which it feels subjected to. With that in mind, CCTV-9, the international 
C division of  CCTV, was given a new look in 2016 by changing its visual identity and taking 
T
I the name China Global Television Network (CGTN). CGTN now operates a number of  
O news channels in English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Russian, available in more 
N than 170 countries and regions around the world.81 According to its official website, 
S CGTN has “over 150 million followers across the globe” (for its website, mobile applica-

tions and social network accounts).82

To increase the attractiveness of  its content, CCTV has increasingly used star journalists 
to present its shows, such as Yang Rui, who has adopted a dynamic style and does not hes-
itate to push his guests out of  their zone of  comfort. Yang Rui was the co-host of  Focus, 
CCTV’s first English-language news magazine. Emphasis is also put on Chinese culture and 

C
A history, with many channels broadcasting documentaries, films, and TV series highlighting 
S the richness of  the Chinese civilization. Regional adaptations employ local presenters and 
E journalists. On the other hand, Chinese television channels seem less concerned than the 

Russians about recruiting Western “stars” to give credibility to their content, as RT America 
did with Larry King for example.

CGTN plays a key role not only in spreading a positive discourse on China, but O
also in propagating counter-narratives that can discredit criticisms circulating in R
Western media, as well as in acting as a relay for Party-constructed narratives. On S

this last point, during the Covid-19 crisis, CGTN in Arabic made significant efforts to make 
plausible the hypothesis of  a virus manufactured by the American army, notably by using 
the channel’s star presenter, MsV, who speaks perfect Arabic.83 She eventually used argu-
ments broadcast by other Chinese vectors (→ p. 595).

C The “Laurène Beaumond” affair
T
I Context is important: first, on March 3, 2021, the French CSA (Conseil supérieur de l’audiovisuel, 
O the French media regulatory authority), authorized CGTN to broadcast in Europe84 – although 
N the preceding month, its British counterpart (OFCOM) cancelled its broadcasting rights in the 

UK and, several days later, fined the channel for its “partiality,” “invasion of  privacy,” and 
“unfair treatment” in four different cases.85 The fact that the media outlet “found a refuge in 
France,” did not fail to elicit criticism.86 Meanwhile, the relationship between China and France 

C grew more tense in March, due to the Chinese embassy’s decision to pressure French sena-
O tors to cancel their planned trip to Taiwan, the insult thrown at researcher Antoine Bondaz 
N (→ p. 237), and the Chinese sanctions against ten European citizens, including the French 
C MEP Raphaël Glucksmann(→ p. 637).
E In this context, on March 27 and 28, CGTN Français published two somewhat offensive 
P articles from a “Laurène Beaumond”: “Visit of  French MPs at Taiwan: the (true) reasons 
T for the crispation,”87 and “‘My’ Xinjiang: Putting a Stop to the Tyranny of  Fake News.”88 The 
S author was described as “an independent journalist based in France, [who had] lived in Beijing 

for seven years and was an editor, reporter, and news TV host who, with “her diplomas in art 
history and archeology from the University of  Paris Sorbonne-IV and her masters’ in journal-
ism, [had] worked in several Parisian editorial offices before settling in Beijing.” Her article on 
Xinjiang was written as a testimony: “I am French and I have lived for 7 years in China. 
The fortunes of  my life made it that I have some relatives living in Urumqi, the capital city of  

A Xinjiang. I had the opportunity to visit the region many times between 2014 and 2019, and I do 
C not recognize the Xinjiang described to me as the one I know.” This article was largely relayed 
T by pro-Beijing networks, starting with the Embassy of  China. 
O On March 31, the researcher Antoine Bondaz questioned CGTN on Twitter, asking 
R whether “Laurène Beaumond” was a “fake profile” or not.

This hypothesis was taken up by Nathalie Guibert in an article published by Le Monde D
several hours later, in which she confirmed that “no one with that name was found in the da- U

C
tabase of  the Commission of  identity cards of  French professional journalists.”89 This hypothet- T
ical deception– CGTN’s the fabrication of  a fake person – was largely covered by international I
media in English and led to a flurry of  mocking comments and parodic accounts on Twitter. O

N
The following day, on April 1, the topic was discussed in Beijing during a press confer-
ence of  the spokeswoman of  the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. Answering a question from 
the AFP, Hua Chunying defended that “this person exist[ed],” and that she was “a French citi-
zen who has lived in China for years,” but that she could not reveal her identity because “now, C
in some European countries and in the United States, every time someone says something true O
about China, he or she will be viciously attacked.”90 Hence, the spokeswoman implied that N
“Laurène Beaumond” was in fact a pseudonym used to protect another person. It was also the C
idea defended by CGTN Français that same day, insisting that “Laurène Beaumond” did ex- E
ist (“CGTN Français has concrete evidence of  the several trips made by Laurène Beaumond in P
Xinjiang, many photos and even a copy of  her marriage license as she was married in Urumqi T
in 2014 with someone from the city”) but that the name was a “nom de plume” – while cas- S
tigating Nathalie Guibert for her “total lack of  professionalism” as she did not conceive that 
possibility “for a single instant.”91 Why a pseudonym? “To protect herself,” answered the me-
dia: “Laurène Beaumond wishes to use a pseudonym and we respected her decision, because 
we understand the risk that it represents, for some French journalists, to express their opinion 
about China” – mentioning Christian Mestre (→ p. 409) and Maxime Vivas (→ p. 335). 
One day later, on April 2, this version was confirmed by Le Figaro, which published an inter-
view with “‘Laurène Beaumond,’ the alias of  a very real person.”92 The editorial decision of  A
Le Figaro to publish this exclusive interview is interesting, not only because it is the great rival C
of  Le Monde but also because Le Figaro has been a partner of  China Daily between 2015 and T
2021 (→ p. 188).93 But that did not prevent the article from being both serious and critical of  O
Beijing. It provided more details about “Laurène Beaumond,” the pseudonym of  a forty-year- R
old woman from the Sarthe, former CGTN TV host who had lived in China between 2011 S
and 2017, where she married a man from Urumqi. With this information, and what was 
initially provided by CGTN, we easily found her real identity, her name and birth name, 
as well as a wedding picture. That said, we will not disclose her identity because we respect 
her decision to remain anonymous. Several days later, CGTN rubbed it in as it published 
an article penned by Zheng Ruolin (→ p. 628) who, using Le Figaro, accused Le Monde and 
Antoine Bondaz of  “lies” and asked for an “apology” from them.94 The demand was later A
renewed in English by the Global Times.95

C
Now, and even if  “Laurène Beaumond” is the pseudonym used by a real person, several T
elements remain troubling. First, this “alias” had already been used between October I
15 and November 25, 2020, in five articles published by Radio China International 
(CRI → p. 181).96 O

 CGTN and RCI are both owned by China Media Group and regularly N
share articles. Moreover, when she wrote for RCI five months earlier, “Laurène Beaumond” S

A 1981 and operating under the authority of  the Propaganda Department of  the Central 
C

S 2012. The China Daily also distributes a free supplement, “China Watch,” in many major 

foreign newspapers in English (→ p. 187). 
Like its Chinese state media counterparts, China Daily has a rather distant relationship 

with the truth, as illustrated by this Twitter message which used a video shot in Brienz 
(Switzerland) to promote Chinese landscapes:99

the name Radio Peking, it took its current name in 1978 and now belongs, like CCTV, to the O
China Media Group which is under the authority of  the State Council. Its stated objective N
is to “promote good relations between China and the world” and to increase the Chinese S
soft power. With some thirty offices abroad, the CRI now produces content in more than 
sixty languages.

in trying to amplify their online audience, with notable success. They started to create E
Facebook pages in English for their international versions in 2013.102 Today, they are by 
far the ones with the most subscribers: CGTN has more than 116 million, China Daily 
103.2, Xinhua 86.7, People’s Daily 86, etc., much more than CNN (34 million), which remains

U
C made in French, where the Facebook page of  CGTN Français (20.4 million fans) is in the 
T
I top 5 of  the most followed pages, with music stars, soccer stars and a cooking website – far 
O
N ahead of  all the other French media, which are also a priori much better known: CGTN has 

twice as many subscribers as France 24 (10 million) and five times more than Le Monde (4.6), 
RFI (4.3), TF1 (4.2), L’Équipe (4), etc.103 

C Studies conducted in both languages104 concluded that these spectacular numbers 
O have little credibility, pointing to several indicators, including an exceptional growth 
N rate (37.8% on average for the eight main Chinese state media outlets in English, 5,000 
C
E times higher than the average growth rate of  mainstream U.S. media websites) but an 
P extremely low interaction rate compared to their size (0.006%, 68 times lower than

S number of  subscribers and the much smaller number of  views on content or comments 

on posted messages. A study on French-language Chinese state media106 reveals other 
clues. For example, some Facebook posts generated far more engagement than others 
(more than 150 times the page’s average, while in general the difference does not exceed 
x20) which could not be explained by differences in their content. For example, a CGTN 

A
C post on the Guangzhou Fair presented as “a new impetus to world trade” – news that 
T is not of  particular interest to a French-speaking audience – received 165 times more 
O engagement than the average post on the same page. There are also suspicious discrep-
R ancies, on the one hand, between the number of  subscribers to these pages on Facebook 
S compared to other platforms (20 million subscribers to CGTN Français on Facebook 

but only 100,000 to CGTN Français on YouTube) and, on the other hand, between the 
number of  subscribers to these pages on social networks and the traffic on their websites 
(between 60,000 and 80,000 visits per month only for francais.cgtn.com).107 Moreover, 
many subscribers to these accounts on Twitter and Facebook (who post only in French) 

A are clearly not French speakers themselves.
C
T Taken together, these clues suggest that, as a December 2019 study noted, China’s state 
I media “may have artificially inflated their numbers of  subscribers and ‘likes.’”108 
O This is not new: the practice has been observed since at least 2015,109 and, in 2018, The New 
N
S York Times had already revealed that Xinhua had paid the Devumi company to gain “hun-

dreds of  thousands of  followers and retweets on Twitter.”110 Concretely, this means that a 
substantial part of  the subscribers could actually be bots and fake accounts. It is estimated 
for example that “the top 20 Xinhua re-posters are either broadcast or spam bots.”111

French-language Chinese state media also rebroadcast videos produced by a large number O
of  young French-speaking Chinese women, presented as “journalists,” “presenters,” “video R

B. Control of  Chinese-language media abroad
C Aware that a significant proportion of  overseas Chinese speak Chinese at home and 
O
N consume Chinese-language media, the CCP has set out to win over this population, relying 
C in particular on newcomers. In the United States, Australia, and Canada (→ p. 539), the 
E same situation occurred: in the 1980s, the Chinese-speaking media in these countries was 
P
T pluralistic and critical because migrants came mainly from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and 
S those from mainland China, especially after Tian’anmen, were often dissidents. Since then, 

waves of  immigration from mainland China have changed not only the profile of  local 
communities, but also the influence of  the Chinese-language media, which are more or less 
controlled by the CCP, in each of  these countries, especially in places where the Chinese 
diaspora is significant.

A The conquest of  Chinese media abroad was conducted through various means 
C – including buyouts and cooptation and/or pressure by local Chinese associations – 
T
O examples of  which will be given in the case studies (→ p. 440 and 563). In this way, Beijing 
R has achieved a virtual monopoly on the world’s Chinese-language media market. In the 
S United States, “the market for independent Chinese-language information [is] monopolized 

by the Qiaobao (China Press) and the SinoVision channel, two media outlets that have been 
under the control of  the Chinese authorities since their launch and whose content comes 
directly from the Chinese state media”; in Australia, “Beijing is said to have infiltrated around 
95% of  the Chinese-language newspapers,”128 as the editor-in-chief  of  a pro-Chinese govern-

A ment publication acknowledged.129 The same happened in Canada (→ p. 563) and elsewhere 
C in the world. Even countries that do not have a large diaspora have received special attention: 
T Chinese media in Germany, mostly based in Frankfurt, were also “harmonized,” i.e. they have 
I
O become very homogeneous and predominately pro-Beijing.
N The Australian case was the subject of  an ASPI130 report which showed that the main 
S problem is not direct financing (only one company, out of  the 24 analyzed, is officially 

owned by the CCP – Global CAMG Media, 60% of  which is owned by China Radio 
International (CRI), itself  a subordinate of  the Propaganda Department; two other compa-
nies – Pacific Media Group and Nan Hai Culture and Media – have indirect financial ties to 
the CCP, because they are owned by Australians who also own joint ventures with Chinese 
companies subordinate to the UFWD).131 The main problem – the most effective lever 

C available to the CCP to control the editorial content of  Chinese media abroad – is 
A
S the social network WeChat, which will be presented below (→ p. 196). WeChat, which 
E is estimated to have between 700,000 and more than 3 million daily users in Australia, 

has become “the most important medium for [disseminating] Chinese news in the coun-

try.”132 In fact, there are two versions of  WeChat, which the company itself  describes as D
U

“sister apps” (they are interoperable): Weixin (微信), for users based in mainland China, C

and subject to Chinese law, where censorship is stricter; and WeChat, the international T
I

version which, as we will see later, is also the subject of  censorship (but to a lesser extent). O
N

However, WeChat only allows “official” accounts, such as those used by the media, 
to publish four times a month, each time with a maximum of  eight articles, whereas 
these limitations do not exist on Weixin – as long as the accounts are registered in the name C
of  an individual or organization domiciled in China. These rules therefore encourage O
Australian Chinese media to register in China, via Weixin, where they fall under N
direct CCP censorship. As they are unaware of  the exact form of  these rules and C

E
what can be said, they tend to censor themselves in order to avoid being suspended P
(a phenomenon found elsewhere, such as among Hollywood productions hoping to access T
the Chinese market → p. 350). In 2020, an editor of  one of  Australia’s most followed S
WeChat accounts explained that in order to not unintentionally cross a “red line,” she fol-
lowed the editorial line set by the People’s Daily and Xinhua.133

More generally and independently of  WeChat, the ASPI report showed that the Australian 
Chinese-language media largely censor themselves, avoiding any criticism of  the Chinese 
government and the CCP but also avoiding the “five poisons” (Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun A

C
Gong practitioners, pro-democracy activists and Taiwanese independence activists). Other T
levers that allow Beijing to exert influence on Australian Chinese-language media include O
business ties (especially if  the groups that own these media have financial interests in China, R

S
potentially in other sectors), infiltration by the United Front (the executives of  12 of  the 
24 media groups analyzed were members of  United Front organizations) and advertising, 
which is the main source of  income for most of  these media organizations (critical pub-
lications are boycotted, therefore financially drained, while complacent publications are 
rewarded). These methods are not specific to Australia, as ASPI demonstrated efficiently: 
they can be found everywhere in the world where Beijing has an interest in influencing A
the media in Chinese. The fourth section of  the report will give other examples in the C

T
Taiwanese (→ p. 423) and Canadian (→ p. 539) cases. I

In Europe, there may be about one hundred Chinese media channels, mainly in O
Germany, France, in the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. In Paris, the European Times ( N

S
欧洲时报 → p. 333), founded in 1983 with the help of  the Chinese Embassy in France, 
and printed in four languages (Chinese, French, English, and German), serves as an 
“umbrella” for many other European Chinese-language media and it organizes numerous 
events.134 Chinese-language media in Europe have their own association founded in 1997, 
the European Chinese Media Association (欧洲华文传媒协会), and they frequently meet 
at events in Europe or China (the Global Chinese Language Media Forum (世界华文传 C
媒论坛) or the Overseas Chinese New Media Forum (海外华文新媒体高峰论坛) for A
instance). According to a study by the People’s Daily Overseas Edition Online Data Research S
Center (人民日报海外网数据研究中心) which evaluated the influence of  400 Chinese E

media abroad, two European media are in the top 20: www.dolc.de (德国热 线), based in 
Germany, and xineurope.com (新欧洲), based in France.135

b. Through the “China Watch” of  the China Daily D
U

The China Daily publishes a free supplement, “China Watch,” with a circula- C
T

tion of  more than 13 million copies in some 30 daily newspapers worldwide, with I
O

a particular focus on targeting business executives and decision-makers, mainly in Japan N

(6.6M in the Mainichi Shimbun) and in the United States (1.7M in The New York Times (up 
until the end of  2019), 1.6M in the Los Angeles Times, 1.3M in the Wall Street Journal, 910,000 
in The Washington Post (up until the end of  2019), and much less in the Des Moines Register) C
but also in Europe (Le Figaro, El País, De Standaard, Le Soir, Handelsblatt), Russia (Rossiskaya O

N
Gazeta), Australia (Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, AFR), New Zealand (The Dominion Post) C
and Argentina (El Cronista).137 To convince these newspapers to accept the supplement, E
the China Daily offers a financial remuneration. As such, between November 2016 and P
April 2020, the China Daily paid nearly $19 million to American newspapers that T

S
published its advertising or supplements,138 including nearly $6 million to the Wall Street 
Journal, $4.6 million to The Washington Post, and $50,000 to The New York Times.139

This “Trojan Horse” – or “Worm in the Apple” – tactic,140 has a long-term effect, 
disseminating influence daily or weekly, but it can also be used in the short term, on the 
occasion of  a specific event, such as during an election. For example, during the campaign A
for the 2018 midterm elections in the United States, the China Daily used its supplement in C
the Des Moines Register (Iowa’s largest daily) to try to weaken Donald Trump in one of  his T
strongholds. One of  the articles highlighted the president’s responsibility for the trade war O

R
and its negative consequences for American farmers. S

The Chinese strategy actually aims to produce a triple effect. Two direct effects: 
on the one hand, inserting Chinese propaganda into the very heart of  the world’s C
most influential daily newspapers and in a relatively discreet way, so that the reader may A

not necessarily be aware that they are no longer reading their newspaper – a fortiori when E

C The Daily Telegraph’s “China Watch”
E
P Until recently, The Daily Telegraph received £750,000 (€835,000) per year to distribute 
T the “China Watch” supplement of  the China Daily.144 This eight-page supplement was in-
S cluded in the newspaper since 2011 and also had a dedicated section on the UK newspaper’s 

website after 2015.145 This kind of  collaboration created a financial dependence that affect-
ed the entire editorial line, not just in the inserted pages: it was in fact found that between 
2016 and 2018, The Telegraph published no less than 20 articles of  the Chinese ambassador, 
twice as many as those published by the Daily Mail, The Guardian and the Financial Times com-
bined.146 The degrading relations between China and the UK in 2019-2020, and particularly 
during the Covid-19 pandemic, illustrated a tension between critical articles about China on the 

A one hand and articles of  Chinese propaganda published in the China Daily’s dedicated section 
C on the other (such as “Why are Some Framing China’s Heroic Efforts to Stop Coronavirus 
T as Inhumane? “or “Traditional Chinese Medicine “Helps Fight Coronavirus””).147 Finally, in 
O April 2020, The Telegraph decided to discontinue its collaboration with China Daily.
R
S

The Washington Post and The New York Times also terminated their partnerships with China 
Daily in late 2019 and early 2020.148 In Australia, the Nine Entertainment group (Sydney 
Morning Herald, The Age and the Australian Financial Review) renounced the China Daily sup-
plement at the end of  2020.149 The same year in France, Le Figaro also stopped inserting 

A “China Watch” in its pages.150 The renunciations are multiplying. Similarly to the Confucius 
C
T Institutes (→ p. 306), this is probably the first sign of  a durable pushback against what is 
I now perceived as propaganda, or even as an inacceptable foreign interference.

media also penetrate foreign media by providing them, more or less regularly, with content, 
in such a way that “hundreds of  millions of  news consumers around the world rou-
tinely view, read, or listen to information created or influenced by the CCP, often

without knowing its origins.”151 We need to distinguish two situations here, starting with D
U

the free supply of  free content. Unlike major Western agencies (AP, AFP, Reuters, etc.), C

Chinese agencies (Xinhua, China News Service and CCTV) offer free content. In 2018, T
I

CCTV provided “free video footage and television scripts to 1,700 smaller foreign O
N

news organizations and media groups.”152 This practice is particularly prevalent 
in Africa, where local media can least afford to turn them away because they often lack 
resources, well-trained journalists, and quality content. In addition, Chinese agencies offer C
international news, while most African media cannot afford correspondents abroad. The O
fact that local media use Chinese content to cover international news means that “the image N
conveyed by the Sahelian media is identical to that which China itself  presents.”153 This C

E
practice is not unique to Africa: it occurs everywhere in the world, including in Europe – in P
Sweden for example, small media with few means have been offered the use of  Chinese T
content, images and databases free of  charge.154 S

Then, they also use infomercials: Chinese media pay foreign outlets to include 
articles that are nothing but more-or-less explicit advertisement in their printed 
pages and/or on their websites that the readers may sometimes find difficult to sep-
arate from legitimate articles. This is especially true for the print media, but also for tele-
vision. In Germany, for example, the private television group Deutsches Regionalfernsehen A

C
(DRF), which had only broadcast animal programs previously, now broadcasts “China T
Info,” a daily prime time show which promotes China, sometimes even on political topics O
(for example, to claim that there is no proof  of  the Chinese origin of  the coronavirus). R

S
The insertion may seem incongruous, but DRF’s editor-in-chief  assumes it, explaining that 
it is a “source of  income” like any other. Another German example: between 2017 
and 2019, the public broadcasting service Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) broadcast a 
political and economic debate program on the digital television channel tagesschau24 in 
partnership with CGTN: “40,000 German viewers attended without any critical questions 
being asked about human rights violations.”155 A

This is a common practice but, in some cases, it can be an intense media campaign. For C
T

instance, on March 17, 2021, the People’s Daily published an entire page untitled “Injecting I
Positive Energy for World Development,” in which it congratulated itself  for the diffu- O
sion of  750 different articles – described as “informational products” (新闻产品) – in N

S
nearly 200 foreign media, from more than 40 countries, in 12 languages, and during 
an entire week (March 5-11).156 It coincided with the annual congress of  the two Chinese 
assemblies (PNA and CPPCC). It also coincided with the launch of  the “14th five-year 
plan” and Beijing hoped to circulate the representation of  an efficient China, which had 
extirpated its immense population from poverty and made scientific achievements. To do 
that, the People’s Daily introduced paid promotional inserts in widely circulated newspapers C

N 11 (with the mention “content produced by the People’s Daily”) that bragged about China’s 

ability to “reduce poverty while preserving the environment” on the one hand,158 and the 
resilience of  the Chinese economy on the other (see below).159 Normally, without knowing 

C how much the People’s Daily eventually paid, a full page in L’Opinion costs between €18,000

On the right: the two articles published in L’Opinion (March 11, 2021).

Interestingly, the host media are not always comfortable with this collaboration 
when it becomes public, as illustrated by the following example. On March 17, 2021, Jeune 

A
C Afrique published an article by He Qian, the Parisian director of  the French online version 
T of  the People’s Daily, promoting Maxime Vivas’s book on the Uyghurs – which, as we will 
I see, “dismantles the information of  Western media that accuse China of  violating human 
O rights in this region in full expansion” (→ p. 335). The mention “sponsored content” was 
N
S added at the bottom of  the text. As such, it was probably an article published by People’s 

Daily thanks to an agreement with Jeune Afrique. Its publication was actually relayed by the 
Chinese embassy in France. This agreement was quickly denounced on Twitter, including 
by Antoine Bondaz who presented it as “a concrete example of  the use, by the [Chinese] 
authorities, of  paid partnerships with foreign media to disinform,” and he tagged @jeunea-
frique on this post.161 The criticism was efficient: the following day, the article was with-

C drawn and the link did not work anymore – which seems to indicate that, in hindsight, Jeune 
A Afrique rapidly came to the conclusion that the article bore a reputational risk.

2. Acquisition 

Foreign media purchases are multiplying, not only in Asia (see: Taiwan), but also in A
Europe,164 such as in Hungary, Italy and Portugal: the two oldest Portuguese newspapers, C
Diário de Notícias, founded in 1864, and Jornal de Notícias, founded in 1888, are owned by T

O
a Chinese joint venture (as are other media in the country, including TSF radio and the R
sports newspaper O jogo).165 There are generally consequences on the editorial line. S
When two Czech media groups, Empresa Media and Médea, came under the control of  the 
Chinese consortium CEFC in 2015, the media of  these groups “including Tyden (a weekly) 
and Barrandov TV, distinguished themselves by their inordinately enthusiastic coverage of  
China.”166

This risk is higher in the most open media circles, where there are still places to be A
taken. This is one of  the factors that explain why Japan remains relatively less vulnerable to C
Chinese influence than other countries in the region (see box below). T

I

N

The Japanese counter-example S
Despite their geographical proximity, China’s influence in Japan is limited compared to other 
democracies for a number of  reasons: first, due to an insularity that is both historical 
and economic (the “Galapagos Syndrome”) that makes the Japanese difficult to influence 
from the outside; a fortiori by the Chinese toward whom most feel distrust at best, or even 
antipathy (85% of  Japanese presumably have a negative opinion of  China –among the 
34 countries surveyed by Pew, Japan is the country with the highest negative opinions of  
China). This is in part grounded in a common history of  nearly 2,000 years which, in the C
recent period, has seen several bloody wars and, more recently, the 2010-2012 conflict over A
the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands and China’s subsequent decision to stop exporting rare earth S
materials to Japan. This has often been described as a “turning point” in their relationship.167 E

D Other factors are the important homogeneity of  the Japanese population;168 its great 
U
C political stability as, aside from two short digressions (1993-1994 and 2009-2012), the 
T same party, the PLD (自由民主党), has been in power since 1955, and the other parties 
I are not easier to influence (even the Japanese Communist Party, with little political weight, 
O
N is relatively nationalist and therefore not very sensitive to Chinese influence);169 and very 

strict rules, especially on financial contributions to political parties and foreign investment 
(to protect domestic companies). To all this, one must add, in recent years, a greater aware-
ness of  the Chinese threat, through other examples (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia), and 

C strengthened intelligence capabilities – which make any Chinese attempt to influence 
O even more difficult than before.
N As for the media, the 810,000 Chinese living in Japan are a privileged target for Beijing, 
C notably via the local Chinese-language media, most of  which only pick up on the dispatches 
E written by Xinhua or the People’s Daily.170 The Japanese Chinese-language newspaper with the 
P highest circulation, Chubun News (Chinese Review Weekly) “toe[s] the CCP line.”171 But its influ-
T ence is as limited as its readership. Overall, the Japanese media market is oligopolistic: 
S five conglomerates (TBS-Mainichi, TV Asahi-Asahi, NTV-Yomiuri, Fuji TV-Sankei, and TV 

Tokyo-Nikkei) divide the media landscape among themselves, leaving almost no room for 
anything else, including outside influence. Beijing is unable to penetrate the Japanese-
language media market, which is generally very resistant to any outside influence, except 
perhaps that of  the United States (with the Japanese version of  the Wall Street Journal). Nor 
has there been any significant acquisition of  Japanese media by Chinese groups. There is the 
case of  the inclusion of  the “China Watch” in the Mainichi Shimbun but, on the one hand, the 

A newspaper accepts “news on travel issues but no political or economic issues” and, on the 
C other hand, the Japanese readership see these pages for what they are: advertising.172 For all 
T of  these reasons, Japan offers relatively few holds for the usual Chinese tactics, which does 
O not prevent Beijing from identifying other vulnerabilities, including separatists and pacifist 
R movements (→ p. 401).

Two radio stations broadcasting in the United States are controlled by Beijing

A In April 2020, The Washington Free 
C Beacon revealed that two local radio sta-
T tions were actually controlled by 
I Beijing: one is a Mexican radio station 
O owned by the Chinese Phoenix TV 
N Group, which broadcasts Chinese-
S language propaganda from a tower in 

Mexico that allows it to reach across 
the border into southern California, 
circumventing U.S. regulations.173 The 
other is the Las Vegas Public Radio 

(LVPR), which, contrary to its name, is not a public radio station (it is not affiliated to the 
National Public Radio network), but a radio station registered as a lobbyist for Huawei.174 The 
station assumes this role, as the tweet below shows. In its broadcasts, it indeed tries to counter 

C the idea, which is very present in the United States, that Huawei is a threat to national security. 
A Since its inception in 2016, it has employed two Chinese citizens as “international liaisons,”

3. Cooptation C
O

Beijing cultivates foreign media producing favorable content, seducing them in exchange N
for compensations (advertisements, all-expenses-paid trips/trainings in China, C
contracts with other companies of  the same group, “and even political appoint- E

P
ments”).175 These “bought” private media subsequently alter their editorial line and relay T
pro-Beijing positions. Another method producing the same result is to cultivate local fig- S
ures of  influence (various personalities, politicians, researchers, etc.) that, in turn, intervene 
in local media to defend pro-Beijing positions. In all cases, Beijing benefits from “strings” 
that can be concealed, since these positions, defended on private outlets by private individ-
uals, are not directly attributable to Beijing.

4. Training and networking T
O

a. “Training” journalists R
S

The General Administration of  Press and Publication (known until 2018 as the State 
Administration of  Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television, 新闻出版总署) has in 
recent years hosted trainings for more than 3,400 media professionals from 146 coun-
tries. In some countries, a majority of  journalists has been trained in China: this is 
the case in Grenada where 70% of  media professionals have visited China since 2013, with 
consequences for the editorial line of  local media. “This “‘re-education’ of  Grenadian A
journalism has had a major impact on the local media, which have become much more C

T
reverential toward China. The situation is similar in the neighboring islands of  Dominica I
and Barbados, where the media have also benefited from Chinese largesse.”176 O

They offer several programs: special 26-day BRI training courses (“Dongfang” fellow- N
S

ships); “red carpet” fellowships, which bring nearly 100 journalists from the Indian sub-
continent, Southeast Asia, and Africa every year for a ten-month stay. They are “received 
like film stars, they are given luxurious accommodation in central Beijing, two trips a month 
to different Chinese provinces, Chinese-language courses and a monthly stipend of  up to 
5,000 RMB (650 euros). At the end, the journalists even receive a diploma in international 
relations from a Chinese university.”177 RSF noted that “the journalists are not chosen by C
their editors, but by the Chinese embassy with the Party’s approval. And something A
is demanded in return. The conditions are clear: they must promise to ‘tell the China S
story well’ and even portray its authoritarian regime as a democracy and interna- E

tional peacemaker. The guests are not, however, allowed to move around freely during 
their stay.”178

T
R
O
D The practice is widespread: half  of  the journalists’ unions surveyed in 58 countries 
U
C and territories around the world in September and October 2019 responded that jour-
T
I nalists from their countries or territories had participated in such trainings in China, 
O
N lasting from two weeks to ten months.179 Beijing seems to target primarily jour-

nalists with “ineffective or repressive governments”180 but not only: all countries 
are ultimately targeted, including those with effective governments, such as Singapore 

C (CGTN invites many Singaporean journalists to China for training that they call “famil-
O iarization trips” and that some Singaporeans ironically call “indoctrination trips”)181 
N or Australia (dozens of  Australian journalists in recent years). A particular effort has 
C
E recently been given to Muslim journalists, who have been specifically selected, even in 
P non-Muslim countries, to visit Xinjiang and influence their coverage of  the Uyghur 
T issue.182

S Beijing also seeks to formalize its relationships: 36% of  the journalists’ unions sur-
veyed (55% of  them in Europe) had been offered an MoU by a Chinese entity, “a classic 
United Front strategy [...] to co-opt entities traditionally perceived as hostile or neutral.”183 
Furthermore, more than a third of  respondents said that content-sharing agreements with 
Chinese media – which either offer it for free or pay the local media to circulate stories – 

A
C were in place in their country.184

T
O b. Networks 
R
S Beijing creates networks, through regular events such as the World Media Forum, 

established in 2009, and “which – as its name fails to suggest- is entirely designed, orga-
nized and funded by the Chinese state news agency Xinhua.”185 The 10th edition in October 
2019 brought together more than 400 Chinese-language media representatives from 61 
countries. The All-China Journalists Association (ACJA) also organizes a Belt and Road 

A Journalists Forum bringing together around 100 media representatives from about 50 
C countries and, since April 2019, a formal network, the Belt and Road News Network 
T (BRNN), chaired by the People’s Daily in Beijing, bringing together 72 media outlets from 
I 42 countries.186
O
N
S 5. Constraints

In line with its usual methods to encourage self-censorship, Beijing uses carrots 
(advertising resources, contracts, benefits in kind, etc.) but also sticks, taking a 
number of  direct actions such as using visas as weapons against critical foreign journal-
ists, leveraging family members and close friends in China, intimidating local jour-

C nalists and/or media via Chinese diplomats (threatening phone calls and emails, naming 
A and shaming, etc.) The Swedish case (→ p. 521) is not isolated. There are many examples 
S around the world of  harsh reporting on China that was suppressed at the last moment, 
E

or of  critical journalists who were fired. In South Africa, just hours after publishing an

editorial on Uyghur persecutions, the journalist Azad Essa was fired from Independent D
U

Online because Chinese investors had a 20% stake in the publication.187 Of  course, this C

does not always work. In December 2018, an attempt by “Chinese diplomats” to cancel T
I

the broadcast of  the documentary The World According to Xi Jinping scheduled on Arte (a O
N

European public channel) “by intervening with the channel in Paris and with the Quai 
d’Orsay”188 ultimately failed.

The CCP also exerts indirect, more subtle pressure via intermediaries, “adver- C
tisers, satellite firms, technology companies, foreign governments and international orga- O
nizations – to prevent or punish the publication of  unfavorable content.” The pressure N
is also legal, through the threat of  prosecution, which pertains to lawfare (→ p. 53). C

E
Finally, it can go as far as the use of  force. Chinese cyberattacks (mainly DDOSs P

and phishing attacks) are not only aimed at individuals and communities within the T
Chinese diaspora, who are considered by Beijing as threats (the “five poisons”) – even S
if  they do remain priority targets – but also at major foreign media: the servers of  The 
New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, for example, have been 
attacked.189 In Hong Kong, for several years, journalists have been physically attacked 
by people suspected of  being linked to Beijing, and cases intensified during the 2019 
crisis.190 A

T
O

D. Control over the containers R
S

The “CCP’s approach over the past decade has been at least as such about controlling 
the medium as about controlling the message,”191 as one enables the other. In other words, 
Beijing is developing “a sophisticated strategy to influence every stage of  the global 
information supply chain, from the people who produce content to the institutions that 
publish it and the platforms that deliver it directly to consumers.”192 A

C
1. Television T

I
O

A satellite TV service provider, for example, has the power to prioritize a particu- N
lar channel in its offerings. Hence, when the Chinese group StarTimes, which was S
instrumental in the transition from analog to digital on the African continent, provides 
services to its millions of  subscribers. It prioritizes CCTV channels in its package 
deals, to the detriment of  independent international news channels. “In Kenya, 
Uganda and Nigeria, for example, packages that include international options like the 
BBC World Service cost more than basic packages with local channels and Chinese state 
media, sometimes beyond the reach of  what many African families can afford”;193 “3 to C
5 euros a month for a StarTimes multichannel subscription, as against at least 12 euros A

S
for Canal Plus, for example.”194

U
C
T In this area, Beijing is clearly on a path of  conquest. In May 2020, the Academy 
I
O of  Social Sciences wrote that Beijing should use its platforms – WeChat, Weibo and 
N TikTok – to counter the influence of  American platforms – Twitter, Facebook, and 

YouTube.195

C
O a. WeChat
N Launched in 2011, first as a mobile messaging application, WeChat (微信) was devel-
C
E oped by Tencent and it has quickly become a real ecosystem offering a wide range of  
P services: calls, transmission of  images, videos, and voice messages, information dissemi-
T nation, mobile payment, gaming, etc. It is the most popular social network in China and 
S is now indispensable to access certain services.196 But it is also the third most popular 

social network in the world, with more than 1.2 billion monthly users in the third quar-
ter of  2020.197 In January 2019, as many as 45 billion messages were sent on the platform 
every day198 – likely many more today. WeChat is increasingly used by non-Chinese 

A speakers, especially, but not only, by politicians, to reach out to their Chinese electorate, 
C such as in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada.
T First, WeChat poses a problem of  surveillance and censorship. The messages 
O exchanged on the app (which are not encrypted) pass through a server managed by 
R
S Tencent which filters, detects, blocks, and reports to the Chinese authorities the 

content they consider unacceptable. In several successive studies since 2016, Citizen 
Lab (University of  Toronto) has shown how censored messages are those that contain 
one or more keywords, or combinations of  keywords, that are automatically detected.199 
One hacker also showed that, out of  3.8 billion messages intercepted on March 18, 2019, 
59 millions of  which were in English and 19 millions of  which were sent from outside 

A
C China, keywords such as “Xi Jinping,” “CCP,” “Rights,” “1989,” “Tibet,” “Authorities,” 
T “Crackdown,” “Party,” “Tian’anmen” automatically triggered the selection of  the conver-
I sation for review.200 In this way, WeChat censors in real time.201 The app can also auto-
O matically detect and censor images (by comparing them with a database of  banned 
N
S images considered “politically sensitive,” and using an “MD5 hash” – a kind of  digital 

fingerprint).202

The Covid-19 led to another round of  censorship on WeChat: many users in D
U

North America, Europe, and Asia have noticed that, since February 2020, their con- C

tacts in China can no longer see messages that others post in shared groups.203 An initial T
I

study showed that between January 1 and 31, 2020, 132 keyword combinations related to O
N

the outbreak, in both simplified and traditional Chinese, triggered censorship, and then 
another 384 between February 1 and 15, for a total of  516 in that month-and-a-half  
period. Among the sub-topics censored were the CCP’s response to the crisis, in particu- C
lar any criticism of  the measures taken; the policies implemented in Hong Kong, Taiwan O
and Macau; and a few specific individuals, such as Dr. Li Wenliang (19 combinations with N
his name), one of  the first doctors to have warned of  the outbreak of  the virus and who C

E
died in Wuhan on 7 February.204 A second study showed that between January 1 and May P
31, a total of  2,174 key words were censored (162 in January, 645 in February, 501 in T
March, 628 in April, 238 in May).205 S

“In Canada, WeChat censors deleted a Member of  Parliament’s message to con-
stituents praising Hong Kong’s Umbrella Movement protesters, manipulated dissemi-
nation of  news reports related to Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou’s arrest, and blocked 
broader media coverage of  Chinese government corruption and leading Chinese offi-
cials. In the United States, Chinese Americans have reported censorship of  WeChat posts A

C
in group conversations about local political issues, or had their accounts shut down after T
commenting about democratic parties’ victory in Hong Kong’s district council elections in O
November 2019.”206 Messages posted by diplomatic missions are also widely cen- R

S
sored: when the accounts of  the American and British talk about Hong Kong, the South 
China Sea, the pandemic, and ethnic minorities, the Uyghurs for instance, or when the 
account of  the Indian embassy talks about the clashes between the Chinese and Indian 
armies in Ladakh.207

Citizen Lab has shown that surveillance on WeChat affects all users, including those 
abroad, whereas it was initially thought to apply only to accounts registered in China.208 A
Not only are “documents and images shared among non-China-registered accounts…sub- C

T
ject to content surveillance [but they are also] used to build up the database WeChat uses to I
censor China-registered accounts.”209 In other words, those who use WeChat in France, O
the United States, Australia, Canada, are indirectly contributing to enhancing the N

S
surveillance of  the population in China.

Second, WeChat also poses a problem of  propaganda and disinformation. One of  
its peculiarities, especially when compared to applications such as WhatsApp, is that users 
can create private chat groups but also receive information from official accounts.210 This 
makes WeChat a hybrid application, both private messaging and social media, that competes 
with other information sources. Beijing thus uses WeChat as a vehicle to reach Chinese C
communities abroad directly, through official accounts, or indirectly, by instrumentalizing A

T
I money to fund legal action against a journalist critical of  Beijing (→ p. 576), and 
O
N spread fake news and conspiracy theories, for example about the origin of  Covid-19 

(→ p. 599). WeChat has also been used for election interference, to encourage vot-
ing for certain candidates of  Chinese origin, as in Canada (→ p. 562), or voting against 

C an incumbent government, as in Australia (→ p. 269). During the May 2019 election in 
O Australia, where WeChat is the primary source of  information for 26% of  citizens of  
N Chinese descent, a “fear campaign” against the Labor Party was organized on WeChat 
C
E “in a way that could influence critical marginal seats, away from the scrutiny of  the main 
P campaign.”211 The Chinese app also caused a stir in Canada in 2019 when Karen Wang, the 
T Liberal Party candidate in the Burnaby South district in British Columbia used it to try to 
S win the votes of  the Chinese community in her district, reminding members of  the Chinese 

diaspora that she was the “only candidate of  Chinese descent” against the NDP’s Jagmeet 
Singh, of  “Indian descent.” Karen Wang was heavily criticized in the media and on social 
networks and was forced to withdraw.212

In France, the United Front’s agents of  influence, acting through the Association for 
A
C China’s Peaceful Reunification,213 also use WeChat to mobilize the population of  Chinese 
T descent during elections214 or to support demonstrations, such as the movement that arose 
O “spontaneously” against “injustice and police violence” after the death of  Liu Shaoyao, 
R who was shot by the police in March 2017. Chinese authorities have asked France to shed 
S light on this case, but they have also mobilized, via WeChat in particular, the French pop-

ulation of  Chinese origin and Chinese residents in France215 to put pressure on the French 
government.

A study conducted by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism216 at Columbia University, 
on the use of  WeChat in the United States also showed that the level and nature of  dis-

A information operations on the network were similar to what could be observed on 
C
T Facebook: hyper-partisan comments, caricatures, stories leading to the reinforcement of  
I dissent. Certain topics are the subject of  recurrent debates, such as the question of  the 
O integration of  minorities (especially Asian minorities), discrimination, the right and con-
N
S ditions of  the vote, and unemployment. Rumors are also frequent and tend to accentuate 

the divisions in the American society.217 But most rumors and fake news seem to come 
from private groups and individuals who have no state support and do not, for that matter, 
always seem to have a political agenda.

b. Weibo D
U

Second largest social network in China after WeChat: Weibo (微博), which means C
T

“microblog” in Chinese, and is a microblogging website similar to Twitter. It was created I
O

by the Chinese company Sina Corporation – hence its full name “Sina Weibo” (新浪微 N

博) – in 2009, a year marked by the twentieth anniversary of  Tian’anmen but also by the 
Urumqi Riots in Xinjiang, following which the Chinese authorities decided to block Twitter, 
Facebook, and the Chinese equivalent of  Twitter at the time, Fanfou (饭否).218 With some C
511 million active monthly users in the third quarter of  2020, Weibo has reportedly had O

N
more users than Twitter in recent years.219

C
Generally presented as the Chinese Twitter, the Weibo platform is actually more like E

Facebook. It is possible to create groups, share stories, texts beyond the initial 140-char- P
acter limit (lifted in 2016),220 live-stream, and make purchases. The strategic partnership T

S
signed with Alibaba – which acquired 18% of  Weibo in 2013, then 30% in 2015 – has 
indeed made the development of  e-commerce features possible on the platform.

As with WeChat, access to the platform is increasingly regulated and requires the ver-
ification of  the user’s identity. The content that circulates on the platform is subjected to 
ever-increasing surveillance. In 2012, the Greatfire.org website already estimated that A
about 2,500 words were blocked on it.221 In 2017, the platform recruited 1,000 “monitors” C
(监 督员) among its users to monitor and report pornographic, harmful, and illegal con- T
tent. These monitors had to report at least 200 pieces of  content for a fixed monthly fee O

R
of  RMB200, or less than €30, and there were in-kind rewards (cell phones and computers) S
for the ten best performing monitors of  the month, i.e., those who reported the most con-
tent.222 The Cyberspace Administration had previously sanctioned the platform for dissem-
inating illegal information and for other problems, although it is not clear for what specific 
content the platform was punished.223

Also, censorship efforts do not spare foreign governments whose embassies or offi- A
cials choose to open an account on the platform. In 2011, the Canadian embassy’s post C
about Chinese fugitive Lai Changxing (赖昌星) was immediately deleted for instance.224 T
Censorship can take various forms, ranging from the outright deletion of  the publication, I

O
either immediately or with a delay, to the temporary deactivation of  the commenting and N
sharing features of  the publications.225 In order to circumvent censorship, the U.S. embas- S
sy’s account came up with the idea of  sharing a politically charged article which discussed, 
among other things, Wang Lijun (王立军), a police officer, and Chen Guangcheng (陈光
诚), a Chinese activist, and their efforts to gain political asylum in the United States but

E c. TikTok
P TikTok, a video-sharing social network, is the international version of  Douyin (抖音), 
T
S launched in China in 2016 and developed by ByteDance. TikTok was launched in September 

2017 and has since grown dramatically around the world, notably in the United States 
where it counted 100 million active monthly users in August 2020, an 800% increase since 
January 2018. Globally, TikTok had approximately one billion users in January 2021.228 Like 
WeChat and Weibo, TikTok is a monitored and censored platform. An ASPI report 

A found “that TikTok engages in censorship on a range of  political and social topics, while 
C also demoting and suppressing content.”229 The report noted that “ByteDance executives, 
T including CEO Zhang Yiming (张一鸣), have stated on the record that they’ll ensure that 
O
R their products serve to promote the CCP’s propaganda agenda. [They] made it clear that 
S the party line should be integrated into the company’s apps down to the level of  

the algorithm.” For example, in 2018, a joke-sharing app developed by the company was 
removed: “The product [had] gone astray, posting content that [went] against socialist core 
values,” Zhang recounted.230 The company has since hired 4,000 additional censors and 
invested a lot of  money to develop an algorithm that incorporates these “socialist core 

A values.”
C Another milestone was reached during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020: a former 
T employee testified that “ByteDance’s army of  content moderators were using the tools 
I and algorithms that I helped develop to delete content, change the narrative and 
O
N alter memories of  the suffering and trauma inflicted on Chinese people during the 
S COVID-19 outbreak.” He also explained that, in early 2020, the company employed 

20,000 content moderators solely tasked with surveilling the Chinese traffic. Additionally, 
he showed how automatic censorship worked: the soundtrack of  livestreamed events is 
automatically transcribed into text and an algorithm then compares the text with “a long 
and constantly-updated list of  sensitive words, dates and names” that normally triggers 
a report. The Cyberspace Administration of  China constantly sends directives – some-

C times more than a hundred a day – to ByteDance’s Content Quality Center (内容质量中
A 心) which then integrates them in its moderation. And its technical team receives multi-
S
E ple demands to build “an algorithm that could automatically detect when a Douyin user 

spoke Uyghur, and then cut off  the livestream session” because the moderators did not

Censorship covers not only the usual topics (vid eos mentioning Tian’anmen, 
Tibetan independence, or Falun Gong are removed),232 but also LGBTQ+ topics (the 
hashtags #гей (“gay” in Russian), #ягей (“I am gay” in R ussian), #ялесбиянка (“I am C
a lesbian” in Russian), # # ,(gay” in Arabic“)  #مثلي_الجنس transgender” in O“)  #المتحول جنس يا
Arabic), #gei (“gay” in Estonian), #gej (“gay” in Bosnian) are automatically removed from N

 الم تحول جنس يا مثلي الجن س
the platform), and criticism of  certain political leaders or regimes (“#путинвор” C

(“Putin is a thief ” in Russ 
E

ian)). TikTok’s justification is a “localized approach to moder- P
ation” in which it restricts  access to certain terms to comply with “local laws.”233 Yet the T
Guardian found that LGBTQ+ content was censored even in countries where homosex- S
uality was not illegal.234  #المتحول جنس يا

Furthermore, leaked mاoس يdجنe rلaوtحioم تnال files obtained by The Intercept showed that “TikTok 
has influenced content on its platform not just by censoring videos and disap-
pearing users, but by padding feeds with content from ‘shadow accounts’ oper-
ated by company employees posing as regular users. Internal employee guidelines A

C
[...] suggest that ByteDance employees scoured Instagram for popular topics, down- T
loaded the videos, and reshared them to TikTok to maintain a steady spray of  appealing O
content.”235 R

S
Samantha Hoffman, author of  an ASPI report on data collection by Chinese state-owned 

enterprises,236 added that “TikTok is a good example of  a seemingly benign app that 
can give the CCP a lot of  useful data … [that] can be used to understand how people 
are influenced and how they think.”237

U E. The Case of  Africa 
C
T
I The major agencies – Xinhua, CGTN and China Daily – have offices in Africa. In 
O
N 2012, Xinhua and CCTV installed their African headquarters in Nairobi, from where they 

produce content in English and French for the entire continent. China Radio International 
(CRI) is based in Dakar. In general, the editorial structure is dual, with draft articles reviewed 

C first by African editors and then (censored by) Chinese editors in Beijing. There are few 
O constraints on African journalists when they write, but they subsequently quickly realize 
N
C that the published text may be very different from what they have submitted.239

E Chinese censorship and procedures heavily impact the format of  the broadcasts 
P and the daily work of  the staff, as Selma Mihoubi explained: “[the] journalists and trans-
T lators working for CRI are subject to strict rules of  compliance with the communiqués 
S issued by the authorities. They must conform to the terminology used in Chinese, and 

thus act as a mouthpiece for the government. Also, live broadcasts are impossible or very 
rare on CRI, as all information must be double-checked by the CCP. All stories must be 
checked again before being broadcast, a time-consuming task that prevents Chinese 

A radio from being first in broadcasting international news.”240 All of  this undermines the 
C popularity of  Chinese broadcasts in Africa, which are less responsive and always very 
T official in tone, a contrast with competing Western or Russian media “that rely on speed 
O and sensationalism to hook their listeners.”241
R
S The vast majority of  African journalists are critical, and they willingly “denounce 

the bad journalistic practices of  Chinese media, some of  which are considered anti-dem-
ocratic, such as the censorship and systematic proofreading of  articles by an officer of  
the Chinese Communist Party, or the ban on live broadcasts.”242 African populations are 
apparently not fooled and do not trust Chinese media more than African media.243 “Most 
Africans realise the subjectivity of  the news programmes broadcast by China. They con-

A
C sume all kinds of  content distributed by the Chinese media, but mistrust the news pro-
T grammes.”244 On the other hand, they appreciate the positive tone of  Chinese media: 
I there is a widespread belief  that Western media are biased and convey a catastrophic and 
O
N miserable vision of  Africa that focuses on conflicts, natural disasters, and governance prob-
S lems. From this point of  view, the Chinese approach of  “constructive” or “positive” jour-

nalism (to tell “good stories” about China but also about China-Africa relations and their 
successes, etc.) is attractive. There is a need for positivity to which Chinese media responds 
by emphasizing economic development, infrastructure, or a modern Africa that is moving 
on, on path to development, etc.245

Beijing has made significant efforts to attract African journalists, with dona-
C tions of  equipment to local newsrooms (computers, printers, microphones, smartphones, 
A etc.) and frequent invitations to China. Each year, the China-Africa Media Cooperation 
S Forum invites about 30 African journalists for training trips that last from six to ten months.

In order to seduce the local populations, Beijing is also developing a pro-Third-World 
discourse, reminding its audience of  the Chinese commitment to African independence and 
that, “from a historical point of  view, there is no colonial history between China and Africa, C
on the contrary, China and Africa have been the object of  colonial aggression; they have O
the same experience.”247 To move in this direction, Beijing introduced a resolution against N
colonialism at the UN Human Rights Council (→ p. 216) on September 29, 2021, a few C

E
days after the deputy spokesman of  the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, Zhao Lijian (→ p. 232), P
denounced the “historical debts,” which included “the colonial system” of  “some Western T
countries.” According to Antoine Kernen, a researcher at the University of  Lausanne, “in S
many respects, China is pursuing a colonial policy in the regions of  Xinjiang and Tibet, exploit-
ing the resources there and pushing aside the local populations. [However,] China’s maneuver 
at the Human Rights Council is not directed at the West, as it gave up trying to convince it, 
but at Africa. The anti-Western discourse is aimed at an increase of  its sphere of  influ-
ence.”248 That said, and despite their efforts, Chinese media sometimes harm themselves by A

C
portraying a stereotypical or even racist image of  local people, as illustrated by the annual T
Spring Festival Gala on CCTV, which sparked controversy.249 O

These persisting blunders may be explained in the same way as those committed by C
Beijing elsewhere in the world, notably in Europe: Chinese state media are primarily A
tasked with projecting the image of  a strong and powerful China among its people S
– as such, the incidence of  propaganda abroad is often an afterthought.251 E

D In terms of  content, as often, China talks a lot about itself, most prominently about 
U
C its president (news about Xi Jinping), its companies and their activities in Africa, its devel-
T
I opment aid (especially in the agricultural and medical fields), its history and culture. It is an 
O
N exclusively ameliorative coverage (for China), and potentially controversial subjects are 

avoided: “subjects such as the exploitation of  oil or uranium, or the use of  fishing resources 
by Chinese companies are not covered.”252 In the Sahel, their coverage of  the conflict in 

C Mali focuses on the MINUSMA, which again deals with itself  since the MINUSMA has a 
O large contingent (400) of  Chinese Blue Helmets.
N The Chinese media also played a role in Burkina Faso’s decision to abandon Taiwan in 
C
E May 2018, as they helped isolate the country in the region: “[it] was indeed their isolation, 
P accompanied by a Chinese offensive to gain a foothold in the Sahel – for example with the 
T opening of  a Chamber of  Commerce in Burkina Faso, the recruitment of  local journalists 
S and the creation of  an Association of  Friends of  China in Burkina Faso – that led to the 

decision.”253

In any case, “contrary to Russian organizations, Chinese agencies remain focal-
ized on the diffusion of  narratives on the Chinese regime, without trying to adapt 
themselves to the local problematics and arguments, which heavily limits their pop-

A
C ularity and ultimately their propagation in Africa.”254 (See box below).
T
O
R
S Russian media are much more reproduced than Chinese media

A French team from the GEODE research lab (University of  Paris 8) analyzed “content written 
in French by two Russian agencies (548 articles from RT and Sputnik) and five Chinese agen-
cies (230 articles from Xinhua, CCTV, CRI, CRI Senegal, and China Daily) on topics dealing 
with Africa,” i.e., 3,889 pages that reproduced all or part of  the stories written by the Russian 
media and 484 pages that reproduced the Chinese media. First observation: Russian content 

A was reproduced much more often (7.09 times on average) than Chinese content (2.1).255 The 
C authors explained this by the fact that “most of  the content published by Chinese media out-
T lets dealt with Chinese preoccupations and not African issues […] the diplomatic, national-
I istic, and defense nature of  Chinese media publications hindered their popularity in 
O African publics, as their content is not very relevant to their concerns. The content produced 
N by Russian media, on the other hand, dealt with much more diverse and politically engaged 
S themes and issues, which explained why there were many more platforms that pick up Russian 

content.”256 There were variations between the countries: for example, the largest number of  
websites relaying Chinese media was found in Guinea, Senegal, Algeria, Morocco, Ivory Coast, 
and Benin, and the most consulted relaying websites were in Ivory Coast, Morocco, Tunisia, 
and Niger.257 The researchers also believed that “the coverage of  Chinese content in Africa 
was not an ideological and activist phenomenon on the part of  relaying websites, but usually 
an “easy” solution as the articles were freely available and allowed African outlets to relay or 
cover the relations between China and African countries.”258

The People’s Republic of  China (PRC) is a permanent member of  the U.N. Security 
Council, with a veto power, and it holds several key positions in the organization, 
including the top executive position in four of  the fifteen specialized agencies. It provides C
one of  the largest financial contributions and has more peacekeeping troops deployed O

N
around the world than the other four permanent members of  the Security Council – the C
US, Russia, France, and the U.K. – combined. Hence, it has unquestionably become a major E
player on the international scene since joining the UN in 1971. P

T
Rather than adapting itself  to international norms, the PRC has shown that it seeks S

instead to overhaul the international system (→ p. 148). Since Xi Jinping came to power, 
the PRC has defended the vision of  a “community of  common destiny,” “a shared future 
for mankind,” where a logic of  “win-win cooperation” would allow all states to develop and 
every individual to “enjoy human rights.”259 This ambition is presented as a project for a 
“better world” carried out by China. In fact, it is a plan to reshape the world to conform to A
the CCP’s goals, and to “Sinicize international norms.”260 And these ideas have already pen- C
etrated UN institutions. Several resolutions of  the General Assembly, the Security Council, T

O
the Human Rights Council and the Economic and Social Council have used language coined R
by the Party.261 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), presented as a project of  global S
connectivity and win-win cooperation, but which is above all the projection of  a strategy 
of  influence, has been approved by the UN for instance (→ p. 206). Secretary-General 
António Guterres stated that the BRI was aligned with the 2030 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) UN Agenda, and that the UN would therefore support member states that 
wish to integrate BRI projects into their economies and societies.262

its influence, and thus the UN is the first platform that China seeks to control. One of  its T
strategies is to “form voting coalitions in the United Nations, then use them as lever- I

O
age to propel its citizens or allies to the head of  strategic international organizations with N
the aim of  imposing its vision on the entire global community.”263 These voting coalitions S
notably include African countries for which China is the largest trading partner, or which 
are heavily indebted and therefore obliged to China.

Beijing does not hesitate to use classical diplomacy, as well as clandestine influ-
ence operations, to exert economic and political pressure, to use cooptation, coercion and 
corruption to strengthen its presence in key positions, to frame debates and control the

D discourse, to obtain the support it needs, to impose its agenda and to influence the elabo-
U
C ration and interpretation of  international standards.264 Some are punctual operations, such 
T
I as paying $1.3 million in bribes to the Antiguan diplomat John Ashe, then president of  the 
O
N 68th session of  the UN General Assembly in 2013-2014, and to the Dominican Republic’s 

deputy ambassador to the UN, to encourage the two men to help a Chinese entrepre-
neur, Ng Lap Seng, build a UN-sponsored conference center in Macau (which ultimately 

C never saw the light of  day).265 This was probably not a private initiative, since Ng Lap Seng 
O is a member of  the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Congress, which Peter Mattis 
N described as “the militia of  the United Front.”266
C
E Other operations are more about shaping the world for the long haul. Through the 
P strength of  its financial contributions, China has the means to influence the UN agenda. 
T For example, it is the only contributor to the United Nations Trust Fund for Peace and 
S Development, which was established in 2016; it thus occupies four of  the five seats on its 

steering committee. The steering committee advises the UN Secretary-General on which 
projects should receive funding, making it easy for the PRC to lobby for the BRI.267

Through its growing presence in organizations that produce international stan-
dards and norms, the PRC has also shown that it has the capacity, and above all the will, 

A
C to change the “rules of  the game,” to develop a normative power. This is particularly the 
T case with the concept of  human rights, which it seeks to subordinate to the right to state 
O development (→ p. 216); it is also the case with the responsibility to protect, the norms of  
R Internet governance, or maritime law – to name but a few examples.
S China’s strategy of  influence in international organizations therefore takes several 

forms, including control of  the narratives, for example within the WHO, encouraging 
inhibitions, as illustrated by the Human Rights Council, or highjacking the institutions, 
the NGO committee for instance. The Party targets not only global organizations but also 
regional organizations, as we shall see in the case of  the European Union.

O Compared to the other permanent members of  the Security Council, especially the

S pared to twenty or so by Americans268), but also France and the United Kingdom, and even 

other large countries such as Germany and India, China has very few staff  members in 
UN bodies, a fortiori in proportion to its own population and to its ambitions. The reasons 
are well known: its late entry into the UN system, the UN bureaucracy, what it may perceive 
as cultural differences, its lack of  experience on peace and security issues, and the growing

distrust it arouses around it.269 There is, however, an exception: China has provided the larg- D
U

est number of  interns, in 2018 at least.270 In any case, the quantity or proportion of  positions C

held is not the only criterion to assess the degree of  Chinese infiltration in international T
I

bodies. The nature of  the positions must also be considered. In 2017, Liu Zhenmin (刘 O
N

振民), a former Chinese vice-minister of  foreign affairs, succeeded Wu Hongbo (吴红波) 
as the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, 
a position held by a Chinese since 2007. In 2019, Xu Haoliang (徐浩良) was appointed C
assistant secretary general at the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) O
and director of  the Bureau for Policy and Program Support. His career at the UNDP began N
as early as 1994. Also in 2019, Xia Huang (夏煌), a former Chinese ambassador to several C

E
African countries, was appointed as special envoy for the Great Lakes region, despite P
attempts by Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., to block his appointment.271 T

These positions, in particular in the Department of  Economic and Social Affairs S
(DESA), provide the PRC with visibility, legitimacy, and a semblance of  impartiality that is 
very useful to advocate for the Party’s interests, such as promoting the BRI and encour-
aging more states to join.272 In 2016, DESA published a study, led by a Chinese econo-
mist, Hong Pingfan, that showed how the BRI could help the UN achieve its Sustainable 
Development Goals.273 For some diplomats, as reported by Foreign Policy, DESA seems to A

C
be nothing more than a “Chinese enterprise” that serves Beijing’s goals of  becom- T
ing the world’s development leader: “everybody knows it and everybody accepts O
it.”274 R

S
DESA leaders Wu Hongbo and Liu Zhenmin both used their influential positions to 

block the participation of  Dolkun Isa, president of  the World Uyghur Congress, at the 
United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2017 and again in 2018.275 
These positions of  responsibility allow those who hold them to use the power entrusted to 
them to limit the participation of  individuals or groups perceived as challenging the 
authority of  the Party. A

D nor should they accept instructions from any Government, person or entity external the 
U
C organization.”277 To support his point, he recalled that Interpol had issued a Red Notice for 
T
I Dolkun Isa, whom he described as a terrorist. Interpol Red Notices serve as an informa-
O
N tion-sharing mechanism to facilitate cooperation between police forces around the world, 

alerting and informing them of  internationally wanted fugitives. Even if  they do not consti-
tute arrest warrants, such notices, once made public, can ruin the reputation of  the individ-

C uals concerned, while the evidence that is supposed to justify such accusations is often not 
O made public. It is therefore difficult to determine, especially when such charges are pressed 
N by authoritarian states, whether these red notices are in fact disguised political persecution 
C
E of  dissidents, journalists and activists. The Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, who has prom-
P ised to bring down the communist regime, is also the subject of  a Red Notice.278 Hence 
T the interest for Beijing to have been able to place in the position of  Secretary General of  
S Interpol, from 2016 to 2018, Meng Hongwei, former Vice Minister of  Public Security of  

the PRC. But this is a position that China lost following the arrest of  the Chinese executive 
by the authorities of  his own country. The organization is now headed by a German.

Xu Haoliang also sought to promote the BRI within the UN institutions he worked for. 
While still the head of  the UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific in 2016, he was 

A
C reportedly the one who prompted the then-administrator Helen Clark to sign the first mem-
T orandum of  understanding between the UNDP and the PRC for a better cooperation in the 
O implementation of  the BRI and the 2030 SDGs agenda.279 It can be noted that at that time, 
R Helen Clark was campaigning for the position of  UN Secretary General and hence sensitive to 
S Chinese support.280 Regardless of  their degree of  responsibility, Chinese officials have 

shown that they serve above all the interests of  the Party, of  which they are members.

2. Management of  four norm-producing specialized agencies
A China headed four UN agencies in August 2021281: the United Nations Industrial 
C Development Organization (UNIDO), the International Telecommunication Union 
T
I (ITU), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Food and Agriculture 
O Organization of  the United Nations (FAO). By comparison, the United States, the United 
N Kingdom and France each head only one agency, the World Bank, the International Labour 
S Organization, and UNESCO respectively. While leading an agency does not mean having 

complete control over it, such a position certainly offers an opportunity to develop influ-
ence and have an impact on the interpretation or formulation of  the standards produced 
by the agency.

As a specialized agency charged with promoting industrial development, UNIDO 
assists member states in complying with international standards to export their products, 

C
A and it helps develop and form standards in various areas such as quality control, food 
S safety, environmental impact, and social responsibility.282 In addition to this normative 
E role, UNIDO promotes technical cooperation among member states and provides pol-

U

served as the director general of  UNIDO since 2013. Re-elected in 2017 for four years, C

his term ends in 2021. He was a member of  the CPPCC, the supervisory body of  the T
I

United Front (→ p. 39) until 2016.284 As head of  UNIDO, Mr. Li has created a new O
N

directorate for programs, partnerships, and field integration (which is particularly pow-
erful because it selects countries for partnership programs) and has appointed Ciyong 
Zou, a Chinese national, as its director. With no fewer than 19 Chinese nationals serving C
administrator positions in this organization, China controls its governance. The same O
trend can be observed elsewhere: there is evidence that “agencies headed by Chinese N
nationals show faster increases in Chinese staff  members in both absolute and relative C

E
terms.”285 Director General Li Yong has more than once expressed UNIDO’s willing- P
ness to become more involved in the Belt and Road initiative to “promote and accel- T
erate inclusive and sustainable industrial development.”286 And, in November 2019, he S

signed a joint statement with the vice president of  Huawei Technologies to strengthen 
the partnership between UNIDO and Huawei.

The ICAO works to establish standards, practices and policies in the civil aviation sector 
to ensure safety and efficiency worldwide. Liu Fang (柳芳) was the first woman and first 
Chinese to be elected to the position of  ICAO Secretary General in 2015. Re-elected in A

C
2018, her term ended in August 2021. Liu Fang previously worked for the Civil Aviation T
Administration of  China (CAAC). During her term running the agency, Taiwan was denied O
participation in the triennial assembly, despite protests from some countries.287 In 2020, R

S
during the Covid-19 crisis, ICAO came under heavy criticism when its Twitter account 
blocked several users who had criticized its policy of  excluding Taiwan (→ p. 477).288 

The ITU sets standards and regulations for the information and communication tech-
nology sector, allocates radio frequency bands and satellite orbits, and assists in the oper-
ation of  telecommunications services worldwide. ITU standards are frequently adopted in 
developing countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, whose infrastructures are often A
built by the Chinese. Zhao Houlin (赵厚麟) has served as secretary general of  the ITU C

T
since 2015. Re-elected in 2018, his term ends in 2023. He joined the ITU in the 1990s and I
served as deputy secretary-general from 2007 to 2015, after working at the PRC’s Ministry O
of  Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Since taking office, Secretary General N

S
Zhao Houlin has more than once emphasized the importance of  cooperating with 
China, including in its “Digital Silk Roads”289 project. The MIIT, for which he worked 
for before joining the ITU, signed a memorandum of  understanding with the ITU in May 
2017 at the first New Silk Roads Forum.290 Zhao Houlin also stated that he did not con-
sider Huawei’s 5G technology to be a security issue, which has fueled suspicions that the

woman and first Chinese to be vice president of  the International Court of  Justice (ICJ) 
in 2018 for a three-year term. She had been a member of  the ICJ since 2010.

However, the PRC does not need to control all the key positions to infiltrate interna- O
N

tional organizations. It can also use financial contributions: Beijing, for example, is the 
largest extra budgetary contributor to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs 
(with $575,000, or 44% of  voluntary contributions, far ahead of  the United States, which C
contributes only 24%) to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law O
(with a $1 million grant for five years), as well as the second-largest contributor to the N
International Atomic Energy Agency and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty C

E
Organization, behind the United States. P

Many senior international officials have expressed support for China, often to con- T
gratulate, thank or praise its contributions, sometimes even to promote its projects. For S
the director general of  the International Labour Organization, Guy Ryder, the “very 
strong synergies” between the BRI and the 2030 SDGs Agenda should give China, in his 
words, “leadership in the multilateral system.”298 In an interview with Xinhua, the president 
of  the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Gilbert Houngbo, praised 
the Chinese model for national economies in transition.299 Several other UN specialized A

C
agencies have officially expressed interest in, and support for, the BRI: the International T
Maritime Organization and the World Tourism Organization for instance. Others, such O
as the International Labour Organization, UNESCO, and the World Meteorological R

S
Organization, have already formalized their cooperation in the BRI with the PRC.300

Despite the aggressiveness of  some Chinese maneuvers, they do not consistently suc-
ceed. In 2019, former Hong Kong police chief  Andy Tsang Wai-hung was unable to secure 
the position of  head of  the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime he coveted.301 
Last year, China failed to win the position of  director general of  the World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO). Wang Binying, WIPO’s deputy director general, lost to A
the Singaporean candidate Daren Tang, who had been supported by the United States and C

T
others.302 The possibility that China could get its hands on a fifth specialized UN agency, I
especially the one in charge of  the strategic intellectual property patents, certainly attracted O
more attention and was compared to “appointing the fox to guard the hen house.”303 N

S
The former director of  WIPO, Francis Gurry, had already been criticized for his secret 
negotiations with China and Russia that led to the establishment of  two WIPO offices in 
these countries.304

E ernment.306 The decision of  its former CEO, Fadi Chehade, to accept to preside the World 
P Internet Conference, an initiative of  the Chinese government, came as a surprise.307 The issue 
T at stake here, for the Party, is to influence the development of  Internet standards. It is also 
S noteworthy that structures such as the CICIR, a think tank of  the MSS, participate in the 

World Internet Conference alongside the Cyberspace Administration of  China.
China seeks to penetrate and influence as many standards-setting institutions 

as possible, regardless of  the subject matter. Perhaps more than any other country, it 
has the means and the will to train experts to take on more and more leadership positions. 

A
C However, China does not need to seize leadership positions in the majority of  organiza-
T tions to achieve its goals – nor does it necessarily have an interest in doing so. It is enough 
O that the people in these positions support Chinese policies on their own, which often 
R happens through elite cooptation or political opportunism. These efforts to infiltrate inter-
S national organizations have allowed the party to silence some criticism, paralyze some 

structures and guide the development of  international norms.

A A former World Bank Chief  Executive accused  
C of  having changed China’s ranking in report
T In September 2021, the World Bank decided to stop publishing its influential annual Doing 
I Business report, which since 2003 has assessed the international business environment by 
O ranking 190 state economies, after irregularities in the 2018 and 2020 editions were report-
N ed.308 An independent investigation commissioned by the World Bank has indeed conclud-
S ed that senior officials at the institution, including its Chief  Executive Kristalina Georgieva 

(now head of  the IMF), lobbied the report’s authors to improve China’s ranking in the 
2018 edition.309 Beijing, which is the third largest contributor to the World Bank, after the 
United States and Japan, indeed challenged its fall of  seven places to the 85th rank in the 
report meant to be published in October 2017. The investigation established that, under 
pressure from its general management, World Bank teams then changed data to allow 
China to retain its 78th place – an intervention that prompted protests and the resignation 

C of  Paul Romer, the World Bank’s chief  economist, who now confirms that “Kristalina un-
A dertook to doctor the report and cover it up.”310 It is not certain that, in this case, Beijing 
S intervened directly, and this is precisely what makes it interesting since it could testify to 
E the internalization of  the constraint: the Party-State no longer even needs to apply

4. Controlling the discourse: the example of  the WHO during the Covid-19 N

pandemic

China first took over the leadership of  a UN specialized agency in 2006 with the elec- C
tion of  Margaret Chan to head the World Health Organization (WHO). During her ten- O
ure, she was criticized for her lack of  diligence in handling the 2014 Ebola outbreak.311 N

C
In 2016, she cancelled Taiwan’s observer status following the election of  President E
Tsai Ing-wen. Since then, Taiwan has been systematically excluded from the World P
Health Assembly, WHO’s annual forum. In doing so, the organization has lost valuable T

S
experience, as Taiwan learned a lot from the SARS episode in 2003 during which “Beijing 
did not play the game of  transparency.”312 In 2017, Margaret Chan was replaced by Tedros 
Ghebreyesus, a native of  Ethiopia, a country with which China has an excellent relation-
ship. When he was still Minister of  Health in Ethiopia, Dr. Tedros – who used his first 
name to campaign – was criticized for his handling of  several cholera outbreaks.313 Since A
his appointment, he has more than once taken a public position in favor of  China – C
which is the second largest financial contributor to the WHO among the 194 mem- T
ber states, behind the United States only – going so far as sycophancy. 314 In particular, he O

R
praised its handling of  the Covid-19 epidemic in January 2020. According to Tedros, the S
Chinese government should have been “congratulated” for its management, which report-
edly slowed the spread of  the virus abroad. He praised China’s “impressive speed” with 
which it “detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome, and shared it 
with WHO and the world,” but also applauded China’s “commitment to transparency,” and 
concluded that China was “setting a new standard for outbreak response.315

A
In reality, the reverse is more accurate: China tried to cover up Covid-19 at the beginning C

of  the pandemic. The first cases, which appeared as early as October316, were ignored, as was T
the high level of  contagiousness, which was established as early as December. Authorities I
ordered laboratories to stop testing, to destroy all existing samples, and then to publish noth- O

N
ing on the subject.317 Some hospitals falsified diagnoses.318 Whistleblowers were punished. S
Some of  them, doctors and journalists, simply disappeared. And while the danger of  the 
virus was known, the January 18 banquet for 40,000 families in Wuhan was not cancelled. An 
Associated Press investigation found that the Chinese government balked for six days before

U
C and 20, 2020, more than 3,000 people were reportedly infected.319 Concealment of  the disease 
T
I at a critical moment in its development was costly in human lives: a study published in Nature 
O
N estimated that if  physical distancing had been implemented one, two, or three weeks earlier in 

China, the number of  global cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respec-
tively.320 As is often the case, this concealment was motivated primarily by domestic political 

C reasons (stability, confidence, and the image of  the Party), and only secondarily by the preser-
O vation of  the country’s image on the international stage.
N While it must be acknowledged that China did implement strict containment, controls, 
C
E and population monitoring measures to contain the outbreak in the months that followed 
P the start of  the epidemic, this was not enough to set a “new standard” for all, as Tedros 
T defended. To please Beijing, WHO ignored warning messages sent by Taiwan’s 
S Centers for Disease Control as early as December 31, 2019 and delayed declaring a 

public health emergency of  international concern because China opposed it.321 On 
January 12, the organization maintained that there was “no clear evidence” of  human-to-
human transmission of  the virus.322 On January 14, it only hypothesized “limited human-
to-human transmission.”323 It was not until January 22, three weeks into the epidemic, and 

A
C after China finally agreed to allow WHO experts to visit Wuhan, that the organization 
T confirmed that there was evidence of  human-to-human transmission.324 Then, the WHO 
O waited until March 11, when Italy had more than 10,000 confirmed cases and its population 
R was under a lockdown, to finally declare Covid-19 a pandemic. According to the CIA and 
S the BND, China threatened WHO that it would stop cooperating with the agency’s 

investigation of  Covid-19 if  it declared a pandemic.325 Moreover, while one of  the first 
steps Taiwan took was to suspend air traffic in order to limit the spread of  the virus, the 
WHO asserted that there was “no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with 
international travel and trade,” and recommended that there be no restrictions on trade or 

A movement;326 this, again, was a position consistent with the PRC, which then criticized the 
C
T United States for banning flights from China.

tainly deriving a large number of  organs from prisoners of  conscience who are… executed on 
demand for paying customers.”327 If  this elicited almost no international reaction and if, iron-
ically, China had even helped create the WHO task force against organ trafficking, and placed

a representative of  its choice at the head of  the Transplantation Society (TTS), it was because D
it succeeded in controlling and shaping the discourse on this subject, with three objectives U

C
according to Matthew Robertson: “protect the political security and legitimacy of  the re- T
gime from the accusation that it systematically exploits prisoners of  conscience as an I
organ source. The party’s second goal is to ensure the continued availability of  trans- O

N
plant organs for members of  the party elite. The party’s third goal is to bolster China’s 
image on the global stage as a leader in a field of  advanced medicine, while maintaining 
the prestige and access of  Chinese surgeons to Western medical journals, conferences, and 
professional societies.”328 And, from this point of  view, the CCP was clearly successful: both C
the WHO and the TTS helped spread the representation that China stopped these practices in O
2015, after which date organ removals are presumably voluntary (despite the fact that Beijing N
had been known to falsify data concerning voluntary transplantations).329 C
Beijing bought the cooperation of  executives from relevant international organizations E
by convincing them that they were helping China reform itself  – a gratifying idea – or that no P
one would gain from a scandal; but also with more concrete benefits such as all-expenses-paid T
trips to China to visit medical facilities, funding, including indirect funding (the annual TTS S
conference is funded by pharmaceutical companies dependent on the Chinese market), or by 
“cultivating” certain individuals, helping them to obtain positions, for example.330

When China showed a decline in the number of  confirmed cases, the WHO chose to A
C

confirm these figures and again to congratulate the Chinese government,331 although many T
voices pointed out that these figures were probably out of  sync with reality. The Chinese O
government had indeed decided to change its counting method by deliberately ignoring R
confirmed but asymptomatic cases.332 U.S. intelligence even believes that China deliber- S

ately underreported both the number of  sick people and the number of  deaths to hide 
the extent of  the epidemic in China.333 By late December 2020, figures provided by the 
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that the number of  
people infected in Wuhan might have been ten times higher than initially reported (nearly 
500,000 instead of  50,000).334 The official death toll (only 4,635) is also surprisingly low for A
a country of  1.4 billion people. C

T
This pandemic has at least been able to reveal the extent of  the Chinese influ- I

ence within the WHO.335 The reaction of  Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist and O
head of  the international coronavirus observation mission in China, to a question from N
the Hong Kong journalist Yvonne Tong about Taiwan was revealing in this respect. When S

she asked him whether the WHO would consider Taiwan as a member state, Aylward,

S 5. A Crippled U.N. Human Rights Council 

On April 1, 2020, China’s Jiang Duan (蒋端) was appointed to the United Nations 
Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Consultative Group alongside representatives from 
Chad, Slovenia, Mexico, and Spain for one year (2020-2021).339 The news led to an out-

A pouring of  criticism, the decision being compared to making a “pyromaniac into the 
C
T town fire chief.”340 Sitting on the consultative group is not a trivial matter: the five mem-
O bers of  the HRC consultative group have the power to choose the experts who will 
R be responsible for investigating, among other things, human rights violations in the 
S framework of  special procedures, and whose impartiality should be beyond reproach. 

China will be able to influence the selection of  at least 17 experts over the course 
of  the year, including potentially the special rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of  freedom of  opinion and expression, or members of  the working group 
on arbitrary detention. Each member of  the consultative group chairs the selection pro-

A cess for at least five terms, and the HRC generally appoints the experts selected by the 
C consultative group.341 This means that China is likely to succeed in appointing at least five 
T
I candidates who meet its criteria.
O The Advisory Group should not be confused with the HRC Advisory Committee, which 
N is the HRC’s “think tank.” The Advisory Committee is composed of  18 “independent” 
S experts whose role is mainly to produce studies responding to the interests of  the HRC.342

HRC. The expert appointed by the PRC is a diplomat, Liu Xinsheng (刘昕生), whose cur- D
U

rent term does not end until 2022.343 C

China’s strategy in this body is to change the general interpretation of  the concept T
I

of  human rights to one subordinate to national sovereignty. The two resolutions that O
N

China pushed through at the UNHRC on “the contribution of  development to the enjoy-
ment of  all human rights” in 2017, and then on “promoting mutually beneficial cooperation 
in the field of  human rights,” in 2018, actually advocated for a regressive vision of  rights.344 C
This vision promoted by China is positively received by other authoritarian regimes, which O
unsurprisingly support a vision that insists on respect for non-interference.345 To build sup- N
port for its human rights principles, China has already organized two editions of  the South- C

E
South Human Rights Forum, during which it advocates rights tailored to the regional, P
political, economic, social, cultural, historical and religious contexts of  different countries; T
in other words, a vision that denies the universality of  human rights.346 S

With the adoption of  the first resolution in 2017, the UNHRC, at China’s request, solic-
ited the consultative committee to study the extent to which development contributes to 
the enjoyment of  all human rights by all.347 This is not so much an academic research as a 
maneuver to further imprint the Chinese narrative and impose the Party’s agenda on the 
work of  the UNHRC. The study commissioned by China, chaired by Liu Xinsheng and A

C
whose rapporteur was the committee’s Russian expert, concluded that human rights could T
only be guaranteed for all if  the state enjoyed a situation of  peace and stability, and that the O
development and stability of  a state was intimately linked to human rights.348 As Andrea R

S
Worden pointed out, this is the kind of  narrative that can be easily instrumentalized to 
justify violent repressive measures in the name of  stability.349 According to the vision pro-
moted by the PRC, the state – rather than the individual – thus becomes the primary 
subject of  development and human rights.

The PRC also takes advantage of  its position in the UNHRC to block any criticism 
voiced against its policy, be it about Xinjiang, Tibet, or Hong Kong, and whether the crit- A
icism comes from individuals or NGOs. In 2019, Chinese diplomats interrupted the speech C

T
of  the Hong Kong activist and singer Denise Ho at the HRC.350 In June of  the same year, I
China invited a UN counterterrorism official, Vladimir Ivanovich Voronkov, to visit Xinjiang, O
thus carrying out a public relations operation: they suggested that Uyghurs were terrorists, N

S
hence legitimizing Beijing’s repressive policy in the region.351 Michelle Bachelet, the UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, is still barred from visiting Xinjiang, despite her willingness 
to draw attention to the conditions of  detention in Chinese camps.352

N
S The Committee on NGOs is a standing committee of  ECOSOC composed of  19 mem-

bers elected for a four-year term, but without a rule limiting the number of  successive 
terms a member state can serve. China is currently serving for the 2019-2022 term. This 
committee has the power to approve – or reject – applications from NGOs to receive the 
consultative status that allows them to operate within the United Nations.354 The special 
consultative status gives recipients the power to submit written communications as well 

C as petitions to ECOSOC, and the general consultative status also allows them to propose 
A
S items to ECOSOC’s agenda.355 An NGO with consultative status is also able to attend and 
E organize events, to expand its network, and conduct lobbying activities.356 Conversely, an 

NGO denied this consultative status has great difficulties acting within the United Nations 
framework.

The PRC has pressured the committee to block or delay granting a consultative sta-
tus to certain NGOs, particularly those working on human rights, but also all those that

three requests rather than addressing CRN’s contribution to children’s rights: “1. Please do O
the necessary corrections to the organization’s website and publications in order to align to N
United Nations terminology when referring to the Tibet Autonomous Region of  China. 2. C

E
Please provide a written commitment to respect United Nations terminology when refer- P
ring to certain regions of  China. 3. Please provide what position the organization has with T
regards to the question of  Tibet.”358 S

In 2015, the Chinese delegation to the Committee on NGOs attempted to make the 
committee’s deliberations even more opaque by proposing not to list the name of  the 
member states that oppose or question an NGO’s application for consultative status. The 
proposal was withdrawn, but nonetheless reflects the PRC’s desire to hide its actions.359

In contrast, Chinese NGOs that are more or less openly linked to the Chinese govern- A
C

ment and whose objectives are more or less explicitly aligned with those of  the Party do not T
face as many difficulties in obtaining consultative status with ECOSOC. The China O
Foundation for Peace and Development and the China Women’s Development Foundation R

S
obtained it on their first attempt, in 2014 and 2016 respectively, even though they are both 
affiliated with the United Front (→ p. 62).360

Nearly 30 Chinese NGOs have been granted consultative status today, includ-
ing the United Nations Association of  China (中国联合国协会),361 the Chinese People’s 
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC, 中国人民对外友好协会)362 
and the China NGO Network for International Exchanges (CNIE, 中国民间组织国际交 A

C
流促进 会),363 which were granted consultative status in 2000, 2001, and 2008, respectively. T
The CNIE, which is a coalition of  about 30 NGOs founded in 2005, is the Asia-Pacific I
regional coordinator of  the informal UN-NGO-IRENE network;364 it has openly advo- O
cated for stricter Chinese government control over NGOs and considers that there are still N

S
a small number of  NGOs engaged in activities that violate Chinese law, threaten China’s 
reunification, security, and ethnic solidarity.365 The CPAFFC, meanwhile, is a United Front-
related organization.366 Other Chinese NGOs with consultative status include the China 
Association for NGO Cooperation (CANGO) 中国国际民间组织合 作促进会, or the

T

O

Because of  their ties to the Party-State, Chinese NGOs are often referred to as 
“GONGOs,” an acronym for the oxymoron “government-organized non-governmental 

C organizations.”368 Rather than representing civil society, Chinese GONGOs such as the 
O China Association for Preservation and Development of  Tibetan Culture (CAPDTC, 中
N 国西 藏文化保护与发展协会)369 actually advocate for Party policies, which is legiti-
C
E mized by the ECOSOC consultative status. One need only identify the members of  the 
P CAPDTC leadership to gauge its ties to the Party: its honorary chairman, Raidi (热地), and 
T its president, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai (帕巴拉-格列朗杰), both hold important positions 
S within the Party. Raidi is a member of  the Central Committee and Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai 

is vice-chairman of  the CPPCC, the body that oversees the United Front (→ p. 39).370

The CAPDTC presents itself  as a non-governmental organization promoting the pres-
ervation and development of  Tibetan culture when, in fact, it serves as a platform to 
implement propaganda and intimidation campaigns against all individuals and orga-

T uinely interested in defending the rights of  Tibetans and the preservation of  the Tibetan 
O culture.371

7. Influence on regional organizations: the Chinese-European “friendship”

The CCP’s influence on international organizations also extends to regional organizations 
such as the European Union.372 Lacking a seat in the EU, China hopes to infiltrate it 
through informal platforms. A study by researcher Jichang Lulu found that the EU-China 

A Friendship Group (EUCFG, 欧洲议会欧中友好小组), the EU-China Friendship 
C Association (EUCFA, 欧洲议会欧中友好协会), the EU-China Joint Innovation Centre 
T
I (EUCJIC, 欧盟中国联合创新中心), and the Europe-China Culture and Economy 
O Commission (EUCNC, 欧盟中国经济文化委员会) are all informal Chinese-European 
N organizations allowing the PRC to surreptitiously turn European elites into instruments 
S relaying the Party’s propaganda.373

These informal Chinese-European friendship organizations – which Jichang Lulu called 
friendship clusters – seek to seduce the European elites in order to cultivate a “docile 
neutrality” thanks to “knowledge asymmetry” and “weaponiz[ed] mediocrity.”374

The courted elites become potential vehicles for Chinese interests in the European 
Parliament. A former British MEP and EUCFA president Nirj Deva is a supporter of  C
Chinese positions. In 2019, he said he could not think of  “one big mistake” that China made O
in the last fifteen years, thus endorsing Beijing’s policies as nearly one million Uyghurs were N
massively interned in Xinjiang.376 He also took a stand in favor of  Huawei and reportedly C

E
urged his fellow MEPs to do the same.377 In 2009, he made a name for himself  during the P
visit of  Rebiya Kadeer, president of  the World Uyghur Congress. Addressing the European T
Parliament’s Human Rights Committee, she denounced the Chinese government’s misman- S
agement of  the bloody July riots in Urumqi, among other things.378 Nirj Deva replied: “If  
the Uyghur language is banned, how come she is fluent in it today?”; “If  Rebiya Kadeer’s 
rights are indeed violated, how come she could become a member of  the Chinese People’s 
Political Consultative Conference?”; “If  Rebiya Kadeer is indeed discriminated against, 
how come she can become one of  the richest women in China.”379 These ad hominem A

C
attacks sought to delegitimize her rather than to address the substance of  the issues raised. T

These questions were actually brought to Nirj Deva by his assistant and EUCFG secre- O
tary general, Gai Lin (盖琳), who is of  Chinese origin.380 Indeed, he reportedly suggested R

S
the idea to create the EUCFG to Nirj Deva, pointing out that there was an EU-Taiwan 
friendship group but none for the PRC.381 He also suggested that the mistrust or even 
anti-Chinese sentiment among Europeans was only due to the many prejudices they harbor 
toward China.382 Gai Lin is the first EU official of  Chinese nationality. He was born in 
1981 in Shenyang, Liaoning, and he studied in Belgium. He reportedly first met Nirj Deva 
in a bar and was later recruited as his assistant. Deva is said to have made a special request A
to the president of  the European Parliament to be authorized to recruit Gai Lin.383 C

T
In 2006, Gai Lin and Nirj Deva founded the EUCFG with the aim of  promoting a I

better understanding of  China. About 40 MEPs from about 20 countries and seven O
different political groups – the list was never disclosed – are apparently members N

S
of  this friendship group. About ten of  them held key positions such as president of  a 
political group, parliamentary committee or delegation in the European Parliament.384 The 
EUCFG regularly organizes trips to China for its members, including trips to Tibet, while

B. “Wolf-warrior” diplomacy or how to dignify trolling

“Wolf-Warrior Diplomacy” (战狼外交), a name referring to the Chinese blockbuster 
Wolf  Warrior (2015, 2017 → p. 348), is the diplomatic version of  the “fighting spirit” that 

A Xi Jinping requires not only from the PLA but from all state and Party services, to defend 
C China’s interests and image abroad. The expression was coined mainly to characterize the 
T postures of  the Foreign Ministry spokesperson’s office and of  a dozen diplomats 
I
O who, in 2020, responded particularly virulently to criticisms levelled against China during 
N the Covid-19 pandemic (which focused in particular on the name and origin of  the virus, 
S Beijing’s responsibility in its circulation and on the management of  the epidemic in China). 

Their aggressiveness was all the more striking because it broke with the discretion that had 
characterized Chinese diplomats before. 

The attacks carried out by these diplomats have taken relatively classic forms (official 
communiqués on embassy websites, official protests via diplomatic channels) but also new 
ones, such as social networks and an uninhibited recourse to abuse, admonition

The violence of  some comments has sometimes led platform moderators to take 
action. Twitter locked the official account of  the Chinese embassy in the United States in 
January 2021 after a tweet describing Uyghur women as “baby-making machines.” A

The problem with the term “wolf  warrior,” which was picked up in 2020 by the media C
and many researchers, is that it helps make attractive a practice that should not be appealing. T
Elise Thomas recommended that “we should probably stop using terms like ‘wolf  warrior,’ I

O
which makes everything sound cooler than it is, for what is essentially just diplomatic troll- N
ing.”393 S

Her analysis is accurate in terms of  the informational content, which can be observed on 
Twitter especially (from this perspective, the “wolf  warrior” diplomacy is a “Twiplomacy” 
→ p. 229) – but also during press conferences (during one of  them, in July 2020, Zhao 
Lijian attacked the German researcher Adrian Zenz (→ p. 53) with what amounted to a 
death threat: “what is unjust is doomed to destruction”).394 But the so-called “wolf-war-
rior” diplomacy is also present offline, in the physical world. In order to exert pres- C
sure, silence critics, or impose positions favorable to the CCP, Chinese diplomats use many A

S
tools, of  which this report provides examples: letters, phone calls, surveillance, intimi- E
dation, and even physical attacks. Indeed, on October 8, 2020, on the sidelines of  a 
Taiwanese National Day reception in Fiji, two Chinese diplomats assaulted a member of  
the Taiwanese Trade Office in Suva who had to be hospitalized as a result, prompting the

N When the Chinese embassy puts pressure on Indian journalists

On October 7, 2020, about 250 Indian journalists re-
ceived a letter from the Chinese embassy anticipating 

C their potential coverage of  the “so-called” Taiwanese na-
O tional holiday that was to take place three days later 
N (October 10). It reminded them that there was “only one 
C China,” that Taiwan was “an inalienable part of  China’s 
E territory,” and that this statement was “the long-standing 
P position of  the Indian government.” The embassy there-
T fore expected the media to respect this position, to “not 
S violate the One-China principle,” and in particular not to 

refer to Taiwan as a “country,” “nation,” or as the 
“Republic of  China;” but also not to refer to the leader 
of  what is therefore only a “region” as a “president” 
(Tsai Ing-wen was not named in the letter). As usual, the 
letter ended with a thinly veiled threat: if  these instruc-

A tions were not followed, communication with the media 
C would be broken off. As is often the case, this initiative 
T by the embassy proved counterproductive, since one of  
O the journalists to whom the letter was sent posted it on 
R Twitter, where he was followed by more than 280,000 
S persons, and where it was widely circulated, prompting 

numerous reactions, including from the Taiwanese 
Minister of  Foreign Affairs.396 His Indian counterpart re-

T Similarly to journalists, politicians are also common targets, especially when they 
I meet dissidents: in Germany, a meeting between Joshua Wong and Heiko Maas provoked a 
O
N sharp response from the embassy.398 Members of  parliaments are specifically targeted 
S by “wolf-warrior” diplomats who do not refrain from calling them, or sending insistent 

and threatening letters, particularly when they plan to visit Taiwan, as happened in the 
Czech Republic (where the president of  the parliament was targeted by a disinformation 
campaign → p. 267), or in France, as the following letter testifies. The Chinese ambassador 
Lu Shaye wrote to the senator Alain Richard, setting in motion a succession of  events that 
led the ambassador to insult the researcher Antoine Bondaz and, in fine, pushed the minister 

C of  Europe and Foreign Affairs to summon the ambassador (→ p. 237). Only two days after 
A the stern admonition from the French Ministry of  Europe and Foreign Affairs, Lu Shaye 
S reiterated with a second two-page letter to Alain Richard, dated March 25, this time clearly 
E threatening retaliatory measures if  the trip to the island, which he described as a “rupture”,

was maintained.399 Ignoring the warning he had just received, the Chinese ambassador seems D
U

to prefer provocation and escalation. The visit was not a novel idea however; Alain Richard C

already led delegations of  senators to Taiwan in 2015 and 2018, such as his counterparts in T
I

the National Assembly did. And the five French parliamentary trips to Taiwan after 2015 O
N

had not harmed relations between Paris and Beijing. The Chinese reaction to this proposed 
trip, which is no different from the previous ones, is thus symptomatic of  the increasing 
aggressiveness of  the Party-State, particularly on the Taiwan issue. C

C In the United States, the Chinese Consulate in Chicago tried to pressure state con-
T
I gressmen as well. On February 26, 2020, the office of  Roger Roth, president of  the 
O
N Wisconsin Senate, received an email from a Wu Ting from the consulate asking him to 

introduce a resolution praising the Chinese management of  the crisis. Attached to the 
email was a draft resolution, in which we could read that “China’s action has been critical 

C to the global fight against the epidemic, and China has adopted unprecedented and rigor-
O ous measures… [it has been] transparent and quick in sharing key information of  the virus 
N with the World Health Organization and the international community.” The attempt was 
C
E counter-productive because, instead of  the resolution proposed by China, Roger Roth 
P introduced a resolution untitled “the Communist Party of  China deliberately and intention-
T ally misled the world on the Wuhan coronavirus.”401 
S Along with journalists and MPs, researchers are also specifically targeted. The 

ASPI, one of  the best think tanks in the world in its analysis of  the Chinese influence, has 
published dozens of  excellent reports on the matter, and has thus become a preferred tar-
get of  Chinese diplomats that described the institution as “[US-funded] anti-China far-right 
scholars [that] fabricate[s] fake reports” (see the tweet from the Chinese embassy in the 

A
C Netherlands below). The ASPI, more specifically Australian public funding of  this institute 
T presented by Beijing as “anti-China”, was listed among the 14 grievances that the Chinese 
O embassy transmitted to the Australian press in November 2020.402 ASPI is not an isolated 
R case. In Canada, the Macdonald-Laurier Institute was also targeted by the Chinese embassy 
S after it supposedly criticized the CCP.403 In France, the example of  Antoine Bondaz, 

described later in the report, illustrates the counter-productive character of  these attacks 
(→ p. 237).

These discursive strategies pertain to what Marc Angenot calls an agonic discourse – D
U

satire, pamphleteering or polemical speeches for instance – of  the epidictic genre.404 The C

latter focuses on blaming or praising and can have a role in the social construction of  a T
I

group. In its typical use, this argumentative strategy is meant to consolidate the unity O
N

of  the group, of  a nation, in the face of  designated enemies. Through such a radical 
posture, the goal is to reinforce a divide: those who do not support China are enemies. This 
rhetoric highlights the narrative of  the Party dedicated to the diasporas about the unfair C
treatment suffered by Chinese in the West. Furthermore, it uses modeling, axiological or O
deontic discursive markers (injunction, position of  authority), and it is tied to eristic – the N
“argumentative warfare” which aims to exterminate the adversary and its arguments. To C

E
do this, it resorts to fallacies, to pathos in its vilest form, as well as to invective. The pro- P
cesses are well known: unfounded accusations, argumentum ad baculum (an appeal to force), T
“pathos of  indignation”, etc.405 S

The “wolf-warrior” diplomats abundantly use this repertoire of  discursive strat-
egies as they condemn Western hegemon, colonialism, even racism; they brandish the 
humiliations suffered by the Chinese since the mid-19th century to justify this posture. They 
ultimately want the world to understand that the moment when China allowed this to 
happen is “over” – something explicitly written by the Chinese embassy in France and the A

spokesperson of  the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs (see below). In a word, the world should T
get used to the Chinese power, hence its aggressive behavior (the second being pre- O
sented as a manifestation of  the first), and it should adapt itself  accordingly. R

Based on this assumption, they disqualify everything that they see as a critic. They refuse 
to debate and strive to deprive the adversary of  the very possibility to express an opinion, 
systematically countering narratives disagreeing with the official CCP line, blurring 
the line between what belongs to the CCP and to China as a culture or country. In 
this narrative system, the Party represents the whole China and is the depository of  the 
Chinese culture. This is a renewed version of  the rhetoric of  the Three Representations ( C

A
三个代表) aopted by Jiang Zemin but created by Wang Huning (王沪宁). S

Hence, this aggressiveness of  Chinese diplomats is at the very heart of  the Chinese E
Machiavellian moment that seemingly characterizes the current influence policy 
of  the CCP. The Party’s strategy is apparently based on the idea that seduction is not 
enough to reach its objectives. It is then necessary to constrain and intimidate those 
who “lower” or criticize China.

O
D 1. The origin
U
C
T While this strategy became widely recognized during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, 
I
O its beginnings could be observed long before, with some particularly aggressive ambas-
N sadors already acting as forerunners, starting with Gui Congyou (桂从友) in Sweden 

(→ p. 523) and Lu Shaye (卢沙野) in Canada (→ p. 547), both explored in Part 4. Thus, 
the trend was not new and the pandemic only acted as a catalyst.

C
O The origin of  this aggressive diplomatic posture can be found in Xi Jinping’s decision 
N to abandon Deng Xiaoping’s 24-character doctrine – often summarized in 4 characters (韬
C 光养晦), which literally means “hide one’s splendor and nurture darkness”406 but is often 
E
P interpreted as to “hide one’s ability and wait for the right moment.”407-408 For Xiang Lanxin 
T (相蓝欣), the evil came from even further back: the origin of  this diplomatic hubris would 
S be found in Martin Jacques’ 2009 book, When China Rules the World. Jacques was instru-

mental in popularizing the theory of  a superior Chinese model. The great success of  the 
British author is said to have intoxicated the Chinese leadership, which began to believe 
in this hypothesis, especially on the basis of  China’s recent economic successes. However, 
according to Xiang Lanxin, Jacques’ erroneous interpretation was merely a modern version 

A of  Paul Kennedy’s thesis on “the rise and fall of  great powers.”409 Indeed, Xiang believed 
C
T that James was obsessed with a culturalist vision of  China quite similar to the one that 
O drove the Jesuits – except that they had a command of  Chinese, which Jacques did not. The 
R British author made China a model by denigrating the West (抑西扬中), leading to a dan-
S gerous systemic opposition.410 This interpretation, however, has not convinced a majority 

of  Chinese intellectuals. Chen Dingding, for example, who is much closer to the authori-
ties, believes that the “wolf  warrior” diplomacy is not real, but a narrative produced by the 
United States, and particularly its hawks, in order to stigmatize and weaken China.411

Whatever the source from which diplomats drew their intellectual inspiration, it seems 
A that the new diplomatic tone was initiated by the Chinese foreign minister himself. 
C Indeed, several media outlets point out at Wang Yi’s response to a question by a Canadian 
T
I journalist on June 1, 2016, about the disappearance of  a bookseller in Hong Kong’s 
O Causeway Bay – it presumably served as an inspiration for the diplomats412: “Have you 
N ever been to China? Do you know that China has helped 600 million people lift themselves 
S out of  poverty? Do you know that China is the second largest economy with a per capita 

income of  US$8,000? Do you know that China has included the protection of  human 
rights in its Constitution?”413

Presentation of  the “passport” at the premiere of  the film Wolf  Warrior 2.414

A
The minister’s “boldness” was widely circulated on Chinese-language social networks; C

its popular success and the Party’s tacit approval could have inspired diplomats. When the T
“wolf  warriors” spoke out during the Covid-19 crisis, Wang Yi was quick to support this O

R
posture: “We will strongly hit back against malicious slander and firmly defend national S
honor and dignity. We will lay out the truth to counter the gratuitous smears and firmly 
uphold justice and conscience.”415

Even if  Wang Yi signaled that a new diplomatic posture was desirable – although 
one cannot exclude an intellectual reconstruction after the fact – the expression “wolf  
warriors” is not his: it was borrowed from a Chinese film franchise, Wolf  Warrior, which A
features a Chinese special forces agent rescuing his fellow citizens. It is difficult today to C
trace the exact genealogy of  the graft that led to describing diplomats as “wolf  warriors”: T
we simply acknowledge it here and focus instead on the description of  the posture in itself. I

The parallel drawn between the film and Chinese diplomats is based on the message O
N

conveyed by the work of  fiction, which these diplomats supposedly embody today. Indeed, S
Wolf  Warrior’s motto is “[anyone] who harms China will die, no matter how far they 
are” (“犯我中华者虽远必诛”). The message was reinforced by the final scene of  the 
movie, which revealed a Chinese passport with the following inscription superimposed on 
its back: ‘Citizens of  the People’s Republic of  China: when you are in danger abroad, do not 
give up. Do not forget that behind you is your powerful motherland” (see image above).416

C
2. The Twitterization of  Chinese diplomacy A

S
Unsurprisingly, this shift in the habitus of  the diplomats has led to an increased E

presence on Western social networks, the very ones that cannot be used by Chinese 
citizens (especially Twitter). They were even encouraged to do so by Xi Jinping who, in a

O
N has apparently been heard because, starting in 2019, official Chinese Twitter and Facebook 

accounts have multiplied.

C  75% of  the 
O 162 Chinese government and diplomatic Twitter accounts that the Alliance for Securing 
N Democracy (ASD) tracks on its Hamilton 2.0 tool were created in 2019 or 2020.419 There 
C
E were apparently two turning points prompting the Chinese authorities to respond: first, 
P the Hong Kong crisis in 2019, which coincided with the creation of  a large number of  
T accounts. Forty accounts were created between September and December 2019, about as 
S many as Chinese diplomats with Twitter accounts prior to March 2019.420 By the end of  

December 2019, the BBC had counted 55 Twitter accounts of  Chinese diplomats, embassies 
and consulates, the majority of  which (32) had been created in 2019.421 Next, the Covid-19 
pandemic in 2020, which coincided with another peak in account creation-especially in the 
beginning (February-March), when China was implicated (4 in January 2020, 10 in February 

A
C 2020, 9 in March, 5 in April, 3 in May, and 1 in July),422 as well as with an increase in activ-
T ity (while all the Chinese diplomatic accounts had accumulated a total of  5,000 tweets in 
O January 2020, they had nearly 20,000 in April).423 This sudden inflation, which answered two 
R successive crises, suggests that the Twitterization of  the Chinese diplomacy could actually 
S have been a policy, and a communication strategy more than a series of  “decentralized 

personal initiatives,”424 even though this last possibility cannot be excluded either. 
In this process, several personalities stand out. Zhao Lijian (赵立坚) – the first to open 

an account in 2010 as “Mahomet Zhao Lijian” (“穆罕默德赵立坚”425) – was a counselor at 
the Chinese embassy in Pakistan at the time. Then several ambassadors created an account, 

A starting with “small” postings (Wei Qiang (魏强), ambassador to Panama, in October 2017), 
C
T later followed by larger ones (Sun Weidong (孙卫东), ambassador to India, in December 
I 2017). Then, in 2019, after China’s diplomatic presence on Twitter was deemed conclusive, 
O the most important postings joined the social networks: Ambassador to the United States 
N
S Cui Tiankai (崔天凯), in July 2019; Ambassador to the United Kingdom Liu Xiaoming (

刘晓明), in October 2019. But they do not all have individual accounts yet (in France, for 
example, @AmbassadeChine handles the communication on Twitter).

Not all online diplomats are “wolf  warriors”: it depends on their personality but 
also on the context, i.e. the host country. For example, in Hungary, the Twitter and 
Facebook accounts of  the Chinese embassy are less aggressive, because there is simply no 
need for it: the Hungarian government has been pro-Chinese since 2010 (→ p. 313). It was 
also pro-Chinese during the 2020 pandemic, emphatically thanking Beijing for its assis- A
tance. “Given the cooperative approach of  the Hungarian government to china in the last C
ten years, the Chinese government has no reason to directly influence or actively intervene T

I
in the domestic discourse to change public perceptions. It is the Hungarian government O
itself  that promotes the success of  Beijing in fighting the virus and emphasizes the impor- N
tance of  China.”426 S

O Born in 1972, Zhao Lijian is China’s most active diplomat on Twitter (he is the author of  more

his undiplomatic style and aggressiveness, especially against the United States. He has become

3. The artificial amplification of  diplomatic accounts D
U
C

Another phenomenon which grew most prominently during the epidemic is the T
I

creation of  a large number of  anonymous accounts on social media that sup- O

port the actions of  the diplomats. By following 36 Twitter accounts belonging to N

Chinese diplomats or ambassadors, the Global Engagement Center (GEC) of  the US 
Department of  State detected a sudden increase in the number of  followers after 
March 2020, which coincided with Beijing’s efforts to amplify its propaganda on C

O
Covid-19. The average number of  daily new followers went from around thirty to over N
720, a 22-fold increase. Considering that “many of  these new followers were newly cre- C
ated accounts,”427 it apparently indicated the implementation of  an artificial network E

P
designed to amplify the messages of  Chinese diplomats, a tendency that “intensi- T
fied from March to May.”428 The GEC coordinator gave as examples two accounts linked S
to the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, @zlj517, and @spokespersonchn: 3,423 of  
their 10,000 latest followers were identical and “nearly 40 percent of  the most recent 
followers were created in just a six-week period between the 1st of  March and the 15th 
of  April, 2020.”429 Another example: the Twitter account of  the Chinese Ambassador in 
Hungary, created in October 2019, had 2,137 followers near the end of  May 2020, 98% A
of  them non-Hungarian with an unusually high representation of  accounts from the C

T
Middle-East, South Asia, and Africa.430 O

An analysis of  the 828,646 followers of  two CCP accounts showed that a large number R
of  them appeared unauthentic and coordinated, were created in March 2020 and published S

on topics linked to four main themes: Covid-19 (conspiracy), Taiwan (indepen-
dence), Hong Kong (protests), and the United States (anti-racists protests).431 Their 
unauthenticity was indicated by: their name (many of  them, with numbers, seemed to have 
been automatically generated), the time of  their creation (in large chunks and at the same 
time), their profile picture (stolen elsewhere or unrelated to the account), their language (a A
same Twitter account tweeted in three to five languages), their behavior (mostly defensive, C
with a high reply rate – in some cases, 65% of  tweets were replies – to criticisms of  China T

I
usually, and to defend the country), etc. O

These followers, with accounts that seemed nothing but fake, are located everywhere N
around the world, but disproportionally in Pakistan. It is not surprising considering S

that the country served as a trial platform in the early days of  the Twitterization of  Chinese 
diplomacy when Zhao Lijian was posted there.432 The Chinese Embassy in Islamabad was 
also one of  the first to create an account, which remains one of  the most followed accounts 
among Chinese diplomatic representations, ahead of  larger embassies. Finally, the General 
Consul in Karachi, Li Bijian (李碧建) (@libijian2), “has been the CCP’s most active diplo-
mat (by a significant margin) since joining Twitter in January 2020.”433 C

D 4. The French Case
U
C
T France also witnessed a radical mutation of  the embassy’s attitude since the appoint-
I
O ment of  Lu Shaye (卢沙野) as embassador in late July 2019. Earlier, the Chinese Embassy 
N Twitter account had mostly been diffusing soothing information worthy of  a tourism agency, 

praising the taste of  Yangchun’s noodles, the finesse of  plum flower paintings, or the dazzling 
colors of  the Miao people’s New Year celebrations. Since then, and most specifically (but 

C
O not solely) in the context of  Covid-19, the embassy has been committed to defending the 
N Chinese performances in a more aggressive manner, responding to criticisms and reports 
C or research supposedly conveying an erroneous image of  the situation in China: the treatment 
E
P of  Uyghurs in Xinjiang, religious freedom, or Hong Kong politics for instance. 
T These narrative strategies are often imparted through intermediaries, as seen previously. 
S On November 10, 2020, the embassy thus broadcast a video showcasing a French expert, 

Pierre Picquart, a regular on the Chinese (and Russian) media where he relays – and provide 
a foreign “scientific” veneer to – the CCP’s positions (→ p. 317). This time, his remarks were 
ostensibly read out on a teleprompter, which did not fail to provoke reactions.434 Along the 
same lines, it published, a month before, a video in which an unidentified Westerner explained 

A in Chinese that, before visiting China, he held a negative view of  the country, which was 
C
T taught to him by Western media, but that he had realized how erroneous it was. Furthermore, 
O a few days later, an interview of  Dr. Robert Lawrence Khun, an American investor who

Lu Shaye, a not so diplomatic ambassador U
C
T

The current Chinese ambassador in France, Lu Shaye, has been known as a “remarkably I
undiplomatic,” “combative,” and “vehement” diplomat, “slayer of  the press,” even be- O
fore his appointment in Paris.435 Born in 1964 in the Zhejiang province, Lu started his career at N

the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs in 1987,436 among the specialists of  the French-speaking world. 
With an expertise on West Africa, he was posted to the Chinese Embassy in Guinea, then at the 
Department on African Affairs, a directory of  the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs (1988-2001). He 
was later posted to the Chinese Embassy in France (2001-2003), and again at the Department C
of  African Affairs, as deputy director (2003-2005). He was appointed ambassador in Senegal O
(2005-2009) at age 41, making him one of  the youngest Chinese ambassadors, before becom- N
ing director general of  Africa at the Ministry (2009-2014). He subsequently worked for a year C
as deputy mayor of  Wuhan (2014-2015), and another year as director of  the Bureau of  Policy E
Research of  the CCP’s Central Small Leading Group for Foreign Affairs (2015-2016) – an P
important position that gave him access to central authorities. He late became ambassador to T
Canada (2016-2019) and to France (since July 2019), with the rank of  vice-minister. S
Ambassador Lu was noticed in Canada for, among other things, its virulent criticisms of  
Canadian media (→ p. 547). After the arrest of  Huawei’s executive Meng Wanzhou by Canadian 
authorities, and that of  two Canadian nationals in China, he personally signed an op-ed in The 
Hill Times that criticzed those who seemed to believe that “only Canadian citizens’ freedom 
shall be deemed valuable” and accused the country of  an arrogant double standard which he 
explained to be due to “Western egotism and white supremacy.”437 During a seminar in Ottawa A
in May 2019, he defended Chinese supremacy (“a 5000 year old Eastern civilization, [with] a C
much longer history than all the exiting Western countries”, which “has realized its moderniza- T
tion and become the second largest economy in the world in only a few decade, while it took O
its Western counterpart several hundred years to achieve the same,” etc.).438 R

S

In March 2020, the Twitter account of  the Chinese Embassy in France “liked” a tweet 
asking the “fascist media” to stop “doing propaganda for white supremacy.”439 On April 
12, 2020, the embassy put on its website a statement untitled “Restoring Distorted Facts – A
Observations of  a Chinese Diplomat in Office in Paris,” in French and in Chinese, in which C
this “diplomat,” who presumably was none other than the ambassador himself,440 violently T
attacked France and spread false information. He notably wrote that the “healthcare per- I

O
sonnel at EHPADs [établissements d’hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes] (nursing homes), N
abandoned their duties overnight, collectively deserting and leaving residents to die of  hunger S
and illness.”441 The statement was meant to show to the French – and to the Chinese – the 
superiority of  the CCP’s authoritarian regime and to silence the “unfounded” criticisms com-

The “Bondaz Effect,” or the demonstration of  the perverse effect  R
of  the wolf-warrior diplomacy S

Antoine Bondaz is a researcher at the French Fondation 
pour la recherche stratégique (Foundation for Strategic 
Research – FRS). He is used to denouncing, on Twitter 
and in the media, the disinformation and interferences 
coming from the PRC Embassy in Paris – which 
blocked him on social networks. On March 16, 2021, A
he reacted to the publication of  a letter from the em- C
bassy that exhorted French senators to abandon a T
planned trip to Taiwan (→ p. 225). In a tweet, Bondaz I
wrote that “this injunction is inadmissible. This is a O
characterized interference.”443 The following day, a N
spokesperson for the Ministry of  Europe and Foreign S
Affairs addressed the issue during a press conference: 
“the French members of  Parliament freely decide when 
they want to travel and the contacts they have.”444 
When, on March 19, Bondaz relayed this information 
on Twitter, the official account of  the Chinese embassy 

insulted him, calling him a “lightweight.”445

This insult provoked an immediate condemnation from researchers, journalists, MPs, and po-
litical leaders – both in France and abroad. The embassy even managed a tour de force: C
as François Heisbourg noted, the intervention united the entire “community of  French A
analysts and researchers,” even those who usually work with the embassy. S
To defend itself, the Chinese embassy released a communiqué on March 21, reiterating its mes- E
sage and calling Bondaz “an ideological troll” and a “crazy hyena,”446 while the Global Times in-
ternationalized the scandal by publishing, the following day, two articles in English that defended

In only three days, the scandal led to numerous articles in newspapers and Bondaz won more

O Embassy of  China in France and the actions taken against European elected leaders, research-
R ers, and diplomats are unacceptable”; for the second time in a year, he then summoned the 
S Chinese ambassador to answer for this scandal, as well as for the Chinese sanctions adopted 

that very day against several European citizens, including the MEP Raphaël Glucksmann.449 
Even the former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, also president of  FPI which, as we will 
see, usually relays Chinese positions (→ p. 313), distanced himself  from the embassy.

internal affairs in Xinjiang.”451 This argument reflects the largely shared interpretation that D
“wolf-warrior” diplomats are not looking to please local public opinions, which they U

C
actually alienate with indifference, but to please Beijing by highlighting their individual T
actions as good soldiers that do not allow China’s standing to be challenged abroad. I
That said, this case exemplifies how counterproductive this has become, both because, as it O

N
hoped to discredit a researcher, the embassy drew more attention to his work – thou-
sands of  people who did not know him discovered him and are now aware of  the threat of  
Chinese influence and of  the need to defend Taiwan, especially through parliamentary visits 
to the island – but also because, through its brutal and coarse attitude, the embassy lost, or C
weakened, some of  its partners. These relays might find it more difficult to work with the O
embassy in the future. Hence, Pascal Boniface, director of  IRIS (→ p. 316), seems to have N
admitted that “he could not go on with such a partnership [with the Embassy of  China] after C
the attacks” against Bondaz.452 E
This is not exactly a case of  the “Streisand Effect” since by attacking Bondaz the embassy did P
not seek to prevent the disclosure of  information but, like the Streisand effect, it is a case of T
a perverse effect as the actions undertaken by the embassy backfired. In the context of  S
the so-called “wolf-warrior” diplomacy, we can now call this the “Bondaz Effect.” 

5. Doubts about its efficiency 
A

This aggressive turn of  the Chinese diplomacy was surprising because obviously C
counter-productive vis-à-vis the authorities and opinions of  the host countries: when T
ambassadors, tasked with developing bilateral relations, constantly attack people on social O
media or in the press, relations tend to deteriorate, along with China’s image – which R

S
they were supposed to promote in the first place. The Swedish case is telling of  this situa-
tion (→ p. 523). What shocks and raises questions is that Chinese diplomats do not seem to 
understand that this brutal and tactless attitude, which involves calling journalists to 
insult and threaten them for instance, does not work in liberal democracies; it even 
systematically backfires. More generally, this behavior accelerated a reckoning regarding 
the nature of  the Chinese regime and the formation of  a united front against China. A

C
Now, this situation is paradoxical but not unexplainable. First, it should not be assumed T

that China’s behavior is always rational and calculated: it can sometimes result from I
an improvisation, and the expression of  personalities not primarily swayed by particular O
policies. In this case, however, the “wolf-warrior” diplomacy seems to be a willing Chinese N

S
policy: its implementation is simply more or less skillful from one country to another. Then, 
diplomacy is not conducted by diplomats but by the Party: the diplomatic apparatus 
and personnel are subordinated to it, just like the rest of  the state. In other words, the 
Party sees the diplomats as its spokespersons, which can generate discrepancies, if  
not tensions, among them. Finally, it is paramount to understand that pleasing foreign 
publics is less important than pleasing Beijing. It is, as Camille Brugier explains in an C
IRSEM note, an “external policy for internal use [whose] main purpose is to legiti- A
mize the CCP in the eyes of  its own citizens.”453 Moreover, Chinese diplomats do not S
hide it: “The standard for evaluating our work is not how foreigners see us but how people E

O
N seem to validate this idea, with the most famous case being that of  Zhao Lijian, who was 

propelled deputy spokesperson from his position as counsellor at the embassy in Pakistan 
(→ p. 232).455 This rationale is not specific of  diplomats and, in fact, also applies to zeal-

C ous students on campuses, for instance; something that Clive Hamilton highlighted: “it is 
O important to remember that Chinese nationalists who engage in patriotic attacks overseas 
N are lauded in China and rewarded for their patriotism.”456 
C
E That being said, Beijing sometimes acknowledges going too far and, in certain cases, 
P even apologizes. When in February 2020, Dai Yuming, a chargé d’affaires at the Chinese 
T Embassy in Israel, compared the Covid-19 pandemic to the Holocaust following the suspen-
S sion of  air connections between the two countries (“In the darkest days of  the Jewish people, 

we did not close the door on them. I hope Israel will not close the door on the Chinese”), a 
comparison that stirred outrage in the country, the embassy eventually apologized.457

More generally, the important cost of  these positions – the overall deterioration of  
China’s image across the world and the measures taken to counter its ambitions – generates 

A
C an internal debate. The “wolf-warrior” diplomacy divides and creates unease among 
T parts of  the Chinese diplomatic elite. This is illustrated by the division between those, 
O on the one hand, who claim this name – which originated in China and was not imposed 
R from abroad – and those, on the other hand, who criticize it as if  it were an insult. As such, 
S an article from the People’s Daily, explained that, on December 5, 2020, at Renmin University, 

Le Yucheng (乐玉成), deputy minister of  foreign affairs, “rejected the criticisms according 
to which, Chinese diplomats engaged in the ‘wolf  warrior’ diplomacy, affirming that the 
word was only another version of  the ‘China threat theory’ and a rhetoric trap aimed at pre-
venting China from retaliating when its dignity and interests are affected […]. The ‘coercive 

A diplomacy’ label cannot be pinned on China,” he repeated. “It is not China who coerces 
C
T others, but some countries who accuse China of  engaging in ‘coercive diplomacy.’”458 
I A widely discussed article by Colonel Dai Xu (戴旭) noted that “wolf  warrior” diplo-
O mats have reinforced China’s isolation – and this, despite the fact that the Trump adminis-
N
S tration sparks rejection– and he concluded that this strategy was mistaken.459 This assessment 

of  China’s growing isolation risks solidifying even further with the Biden administration and 
its emphasis on reconstructing the global image of  the United States and building a diplomatic 
front against Beijing. Hence, it is not surprising that this “wolf  warrior” posture was stopped 
or, at least, put on hold to give time to reassess it. This new approach seemed confirmed,

S as a reward for his attitude – was named president of  the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign 
E Countries (CPAFFC); Lu Shaye as well (→ p. 235), the very vehement – particularly since the Huawei affair – former 

ambassador to Canada, who was named Ambassador to France with a protocole rank of  deputy minister. Note that the 
actual weight of  his behavior in Canada in the decision to appoint him in Paris is difficult to evaluate, and it may have been 
less important, in fact, than his previous functions within the Central Small Leading Group for Foreign Affairs.

the closing of  the Houston consulate, in July 2020,460 when many observers expected a vigor- C

N

Europe and Foreign Affairs and that of  March 2021. 
Other Chinese voices have criticized this diplomatic hubris, including Yuan Nansheng (

袁南 生)461 who, taking heeds from a book by Jared Diamond, believed that the simulta- C
neous confrontation with several countries can only lead to the failure of  the diplo- O
macy led by the Party, which might be overestimating its capacities. Yuan listed historical N
examples of  a confrontation with several opponents that resulted in a general collapse: C

E
Napoleon, the Qing dynasty, and more notably a militarist Japan during the 1930s.462 Xiao P
Gongqin (萧功秦)463 took up this comparison with Japan, explaining that it was the exces- T
sive southern expansion of  the Japanese Empire that led to a war with the United States.464 S
He also highlighted the limits of  rationality in the succession of  decisions that led to the 
confrontation.465 Yan Xuetong (阎学通)466 used another comparison: the Cold War. He 
presented it not as a “neither war, nor peace” period, but rather, as a specific form of  
conflictuality by proxy (代理人战争). Hence, he believed that if  a new cold war were to 
emerge, it would hinder China’s policy of  “national rejuvenation.”467 A

The internal debate continues. On July 14, 2021, at a seminar organized by the Beijing- T

based think tank Center for China and Globalization (CCG),468 Chu Yin (储殷) of  the O
University of  International Relations (国际关系学院), also took freely critized what he R

S
described as the trap (陷阱) of  “external propaganda modeled on internal propa-
ganda” (宣内宣化). He noted that China needs to pay “special attention to the differ-
ences in environment, context, industry, and norms of  communication, and pay attention 
to the difference between internal and external propaganda.”469 His approach is sim-
ilar to that developed by Zhang Jian (张建), a researcher at the Shanghai Institutes of  
International Studies (SIIS – 上海国际问题研究院), at a seminar organized by SIIS and A

A All these voices warning the Party of  an incoming danger essentially compare the CCP’s 
C situation to the hamartia described by Aristotle in his Poetics – this mistake that constitutes 
T the triggering act of  the downfall of  the tragic hero. But despite these warnings, there 
O
R is no sign that this strategy may be abandoned. 
S If  the Covid-19 epidemic revealed this posture to the world, the evolution of  Chinese 

diplomacy stems from a slow transformation that has been propelled by the progressive 
reckoning, among Chinese leaders, of  their newly-found power.473 In fact, it seems that 
no directive signaling a change in the diplomatic strategy has so far been penned. On the con-
trary, several organs and actors of  the Party reasserted that this stance was not only legitimate 

A but efficient. The Renmin Ribao thus published an article on August 10, 2020, that highlighted 
C the altogether positive results from the campaign led by the diplomats during the first phase 
T of  the epidemic: “During the coronavirus epidemic, some countries ‘stigmatized’ China, and 
I attempted to ignore their own responsibility – hence not doing enough to fight the epidemic 
O
N – in order to make China a ‘scapegoat.’ [In response, we] launched a public opinion campaign 
S with a very visible banner, we refuted them with reasoned arguments, we exposed their lies, 

and we let the world see their despicable actions and ugly faces.”474

An interview of  Le Yucheng, published on the Guancha website on August 12, 2020, 
confirmed the sentiment evoked by the Renmin Ribao: the wolf-warrior diplomacy will 
not stop, and is here to stay.475 The statements of  the minister carried more weight know-
ing that they were in line with what Wang Yi and Yang Jiechi said on August 6 and 7 respec-

C tively. Le Yucheng’s central argument was that the guilty parties are in Washington, not in

when the United States fell for an anticommunist hysteria, tens of  thousands of  members C

expression, ‘find reds under the beds,’ was coined to describe this insane paranoia […].”476 
In a word, Beijing is aware of  the ambivalent results of  its “wolf-warrior” diplomacy, 

which is “both criticized and saluted in China.”477 This is contradictory since it is pre- C
sented “both as the fruit of  the imagination of  the Western discourse on the Chinese threat O
but also as a response to this threat.”478 This inconsistency is well illustrated by a particularly N
confusing tweet from the Chinese embassy in Ireland, which on March 31, 2021, sought to use C

to Taiwan, some Internet users on Weibo criticized Chinese officials (“weak and incompe-

nomic elites” by the Party-State. The preceeding overview of  the literature has led us to a C
less in-depth treatment of  this tool of  influence in favor of  others – information manipu- O
lation, for example – which seem to us to be all the more dangerous because they are less N

C
adequately identified or studied. E

Economic leverage is notably important, primarily due to the size of  the Chinese econ- P
omy and the asymmetry of  Beijing’s relations with most countries. Because it is the second T

S
global economy, with a GDP standing at $14 trillion, but also the first exporter and second 
importer of  goods in the world, it is difficult to resist when China offers trade and invest-
ment deals to countries that need them or when it threatens to reduce trade exchanges, 
even among the richest countries. Beijing is the most important creditor among poor 
countries. Apparently free, Chinese aid is actually conditional on the non-recognition A
of  Taiwan, in the first place, but also on the obligation to “use Chinese companies.”482 C
Loans are also particularly opaque. A 2021 study of  100 contracts between state-owned T
Chinese entities and public borrowers in 24 developing countries from five continents O

R
found, among other things, that loan contracts contain unusual confidentiality clauses S
and other measures that allow “the lenders to influence debtors’ domestic and for-
eign policies.”483 

In September 2021, an analysis of  13,427 Chinese development projects conducted by 
AidData, a research center of  a U.S. university, concluded that, overall, China spends 
about $85 billion a year on international development, twice as much as the US, 

A
but that, since the launch of  the BRI, this has been mostly in the form of  loans (with a C
ratio of  31 loans to 1 aid grant), thus creating debt.484 “Between 2000 and 2018,” recalls T
researcher Thierry Vircoulon, “50 out of  54 African countries borrowed from China in I
various forms. In 2018, the PRC held nearly 21% of  the continent’s outstanding external O

N
public debt.”485 AidData’s study concludes that 42 states already have a Chinese public S
debt that equals over 10% of  their GDP. But it does not stop there: for a variety of  rea-
sons, including the opacity of  agreements with Beijing, the actual debt is not always clear in 
the public accounts of  these states – in fact, according to the study’s authors, the “hidden 
debt” tied to the BRI would amount to $385 billion. These figures must be used with 
caution however, as they may be subject to conscious or unconscious manipulation – the 
researcher Thierry Pairault reminds us that the weight of  Chinese debt varies from 13% to C
60% of  the stock of  long-term debt among sub-Saharan African countries, depending on A

O
N faith,” as Jean-Pierre Cabestan explains, adding that, “by multiplying the links of  eco-

nomic and financial dependence between an ever-increasing number of  countries in the 
South, China has set up new asymmetrical and, so to speak, tributary relationships 

C that represent a new form of  hegemony.”487 Some do not hesitate to describe the effects 
O of  the BRI in South Asia as a form of  “neo-colonialism,” evoking “the way in which 
N the financing of  infrastructure via loans outside the rules of  the market allows Beijing to 
C
E monopolize the economic assets of  a state.”488

P The economic dependence toward China is, more often than not, the first tool 
T leveraged by Beijing. The latest Chinese five-year plan, approved in March 2021, adopts 
S a strategy of  “offensive decoupling” which consists in making itself  less dependent 

from abroad while increasing the global dependence on China, which would mechan-
ically increase the economic leverage, and therefore the influence, of  the Party.489 Beijing 
takes advantage of  this strategy by emphasizing bilateral relations, especially in Europe, 
so as to impose itself  more easily. 

A
C The use of  economic pressures can also be explained by their greater acceptance on 
T the international stage. Although it reveals a certain contempt for their trade partners and 
O comes with “detrimental aspects” (due to the opacity of  the deals, the resulting depen-
R dence, and the corruption stemming from them),490 these methods remain less intrusive 
S than other instruments of  the repertoire of  active measures, such as subversion and 

disinformation. Finally, and it is far from negligible, they are formidably efficient. 
The Chinese economic coercion takes vastly different forms491: denial of  access to 

the Chinese market, embargos, trade sanctions, restrictions on investments, quotas on the 
number of  Chinese tourists in regions dependent on them, popular boycotts – all actions 

A that have targeted numerous countries in the last few years, particularly Japan, South Korean 
C
T and now Australia.

O ing seven lines of  goods (coal, beef, wood, wine, cotton, barley, and lobsters) and which 
N
S could be extended to others later on (i.e. wool, sugar, or wheat). This, however, is only the 

tip of  the iceberg and, against Australia, Beijing employs many tools from its reper-
toire of  actions: trade sanctions; threats to lower the number of  Chinese students and 
tourists; extremely violent attacks on social media (with the infamous photomontage posted 
by the spokesperson of  the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of  an Australian soldier 
slitting the throat of  a little girl → p. 223); legal proceedings to muzzle critical voices (law-

it was targeted by a wave of  cyberattacks that did not spare the business sector495). And it S
won’t be the last. This trend should worry European countries as they could be tar-
geted by those same practices in the future496.

Economic sanctions are sometimes taken in isolation, but they are, more often than not, 
associated with diplomatic or political sanctions. France was targeted in 2008-2009, 
after Nicolas Sarkozy conditioned his participation in the opening ceremony of  the Olympic A

C
Games on a renewed dialogue between Beijing and the Tibetans, and after announcing that T
he would meet with the Dalai Lama.497 In response, the CCP deployed political sanctions (it O

Chinese minister of  foreign affairs refused to receive the French ambassador, even though 
the Chinese ambassador in France continued to meet with Bernard Kouchner), and eco-

Economic sanctions targeting professional sports are a common CCP practice. 
In 2004, the NFL suffered its wrath for accepting the diffusion of  a clip in homage to 
freedom that included a picture of  the Tank Man near Tian’anmen Square in 1989. This 
“incident” led China to sanction the NFL by canceling all game broadcasts in China for A
a year.505 If  basketball is by far the most important sports market, other big professional C

T
sports’ leagues bet on Chinese consumers and are, for that reason, particularly sensitive to I

C The case of  the NBA
T
I On October 4, 2019, during the Hong Kong protests, Daryl Morey, the general manager of  
O the Houston Rockets, a member of  the American National Basketball Association (NBA), 
N retweeted a picture that read: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.” The Party’s sanc-

tion was immediate, and all the stronger due to the fact that Houston welcomed the star of  
Chinese basketball, Yao Ming, from 2002 to 201, and because it was the second most-liked 
team in China.506 As a retaliatory measure, the NBA’s Chinese partners suspended their 

C ties with the American basketball league. Daryl Morey’s apologies were not enough to 
O assuage Beijing’s anger and Chinese media outlets announced that no pre-season game would 
N be broadcast on their channels. In the end, Tencent (the leader on that market) was allowed 
C to broadcast a short summary of  the games. This late loosening of  the restrictions was most 
E likely meant to avoid sanctioning the Chinese companies for whom the NBA represented an 
P important source of  income.507 
T NBA games were eventually broadcast again on Chinese television on October 10, 2020, after 
S a year of  purgatory, but the reasons behind this return to grace are unknown. CCTV declared 

that the NBA had made a show of  “continual goodwill” (持续表达的善意) and had ex-
pressed its support to China during the fight against the Covid-19 epidemic.508 We can assume 
that the dissatisfaction of  the Chinese public may have influenced the decision as well, even 
if  Sup China highlighted a notable discontent among the most nationalist fringe of  the popu-
lation regarding the decision to resume broadcasting.509 Besides, on October 16, Daryl Morey 

A announced his resignation from his position at the head of  the Houston Rockets, presenting 
C this decision as personal, although we can imagine that both the owner of  the team and the 
T NBA were in favor of  this “solution.” On the Chinese side, even if  CCTV remained polite (yet 
O slightly ironic), the Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao), did note that many Chinese fans believed that 
R Morey only got what he deserved.510

B. The German Case

A “What good would it do to interfere in Germany? Its leaders are fully won over, China 
C is in conquered territory”: these words, from one of  the officials we met in Berlin, ade-
T quately illustrate the current mindset in Germany. Many of  them, referring to “absolute 
I
O naivety” or to a “cognitive bias” have confirmed this substantive tendency: the attitude of  
N the German authorities and of  the business sector have largely been directed by the weight 
S of  the Chinese economy in the German trade balance. In 2020, for the fifth year in a row, 

China was the main German trade partner (first importer and second export market for 
German goods511). This long-standing partnership (that debuted at the end of  the 1980s) 
constitutes the original bias explaining the benevolent stance of  economic and political 
leaders in Germany. Even if  the economic partnership is increasingly perceived as asym-
metrical by German companies, it is maintained by the strong personal links established 

C between the German employers and senior executives (the top 100 or 50 of  the DAX

companies’ executives) on one side, and Chinese actors, who manage to bring a majority of  D
U

German entrepreneurs to interiorize the CCP’s narratives, on the other.512 C

The dominant idea, at least until the KUKA case,513 is the win-win deals stuck between T
I

the two economies, dominated by very positive representations of  China among the com- O
N

panies and the representatives of  different professional associations. The alarm bells that 
rose from other countries like Australia regarding the risks of  dependency toward 
China and the latter’s subsequent infringements of  the sovereignty of  these states C
have been largely ignored. O

Several events nonetheless affected the pro-Chinese stance of  the economic and polit- N
ical actors in Germany514: KUKA’s purchase by Chinese investors in 2016, which opened C

E
up the debate on the role reversal between Chinese and German economic actors, the P
latter becoming the targets of  China’s predation; the publication of  the program Made in T
China 2025, which revealed the true strategy of  the regime in many key technologies; the S
gradual realization of  the actual role of  the CCP’s correspondents in Chinese companies, 
which is becoming more tangible for expatriate German managers through their increasing 
involvement in the strategy and in the internal life of  the company; the action of  Chinese 
representatives in standardization committees; or, the evolution of  the internal balance of  
power inside the CCP. A

C
Regarding the latter, several German experts believe that the concentration of  power in T

China tends, in fact, to numb its system. According to them, the regime needs to propose a O
new political offer to its population, or at least a symbolic alternative: the representation of  R

S
a superior Chinese system. It is the temptation of  “Cosmological Communism” exposed by 
Didi Kirsten Tatlow.515 The exposure (if  not overexposure) of  the German economy 
to the Chinese market is the first variable of  Berlin’s policy vis-à-vis Beijing, and it 
explains the moderate stance of  the German chancellor, who is the main spokesperson of  
her business community. 

The business community in Germany has undergone a significant change: it is A
now divided between long-homogenous actors seeing China as an exceptional market, C

T
without any alternative, and companies that chose to remain careful and vigilant. The BDI I
report published in the fall of  2019 was the translation of  that mood change among a num- O
ber of  German managers. With the publication of  the Made in China 2025 strategy, they N

S
became aware that China hopes to eliminate German industries from key sectors, 
rather than pursuing the cooperation. Sensing the tide turning, Beijing is redoubling 
its efforts to influence not only business leaders and politicians but also public opinion, 
by recruiting communication agencies and local lobbyists.516 But its attempts are not 
always skillful, and at the same time there is a growing awareness in Germany (as in France 
→ p. 640) of  the extent of  Chinese influence operations, thanks in particular to some C
in-depth investigations in the press, including a particularly detailed article published in Die A
Welt in June 2021.517 S

E

512. A good example of  this narrative is the argument that the regime was able to remove 600 million Chinese 
from poverty in record time. Another such discourse highlights the “efficiency of  the CCP in the coronavirus epidemic 
management.”

S The China Brücke

The China-Brücke (“bridge” in German) was created by Hans-Peter Friedrich, a former min-
ister for agriculture (CSU), who was removed from the Merkel government in 2014 over his 
involvement in information leaks on an ongoing criminal investigation regarding an SPD MP 
suspected of  pedophilia. Friedrich may be considered as very close to the business sector. The 
China-Brücke is a forum for dialogue between the (mainly) Chinese and German economic 

A elites, tasked with improving the knowledge of  China among German decision-makers. It is 
C set on promoting “exchanges between actors from the political, economic, scientific, civil so-
T ciety and cultural sectors regardless of  ongoing political events.”
O The composition of  its executive board is telling. It includes the former SPD MP Johannes 
R Pflug, now China-Beaufragter (in charge of  the relations with China) for the city of  Duisburg 
S (often seen as the front door of  Chinese influence in Germany, and a hub of  the Chinese 

presence in the Ruhr); Carsten Senz, the head of  corporate communications at Huawei 
Deutschland; along with SAP and Alibaba managers.519 
Created in early 2020 on the model of  the Atlantic-Bürcke, which was very active in German-
American lobbying, the China-Bürcke strives to leverage influence in the business sector. Most 
of  its manifestations (conferences, meetings behind closed doors) remain out of  sight, al-
though it should be said that the health situation put a stop to the network practices, in Berlin 

A as elsewhere.

In December 2020, a document presented as a leak from the CCP, and containing a reg-

on China (IPAC), which gathers about 150 MPs from a variety of  countries who hope to 
change the relationship between democratic countries and the PRC. The document had 

C supposedly been passed on to the IPAC that September by a Chinese “dissident” whose 
A identity is not known. The IPAC then transmitted the register to four media outlets after 
S
E prookchecking it. The register apparently dated from 2016 and seemed to comprise mem-

bers of  the Party’s Shanghai committee mostly, mentioning their positions within the Party, 
their birthdates and their ethnicities; it was divided into 79,000 branches, of  which many 
were affiliated with private companies.520

political activities, alongside their careers. It is not necessarily incompatible. In China, as we 
mentioned with the LJC (→ p. 72), adhering to the CCP can constitute a career accelerator, 
and is often the main motivation of  the inductees. The issue – and in that, the Chinese case 
differs from that of  democracies – is that the affiliation of  these individuals constitutes A

C
a leverage that the Party can use to demand information on their employers. Some T
could even be tempted to volunteer information to the CCP to get favors, increase their I
influence in the Party, or even accelerate their careers (and so on). O

N
The Global Times quickly countered the media’s revelations. The Chinese daily used a S

classical discursive method and spoke about the “alleged list of  CCP’s members.” “Alleged” 
in this case, is meant to discredit the other’s argument, or the proof  put forward to cast 
doubt on its veracity. This method often hides a cruel lack of  solid arguments. The official 
media added that this announcement was part of  a witch hunt targeting China. It affirmed, 
finally, that this type of  statements stemmed from a lack of  knowledge on China, a recur-
rent argument of  the CCP.522 C

The relationships between parties, or the “Party’s diplomacy,” is an important 
front for the CCP, and a significant part of  its state diplomacy, as we explained in the section 

C about the International Liaison Department (ILD), which is in charge of  it (→ p. 70). 
O
N The Party considers that this diplomatic form presents many advantages: it reinforces the 
C inter-states relationships, palliate the weaknesses of  official diplomacy, offers a vehicle to 
E broadcast a good image of  the Party abroad, and strengthens the Party’s power.523 Although 
P its activities resemble public diplomacy, they more often than not consist in infiltrating 
T
S target societies in order to influence the development of  public policies. 

These direct relationships between political parties can be used to circumvent official 
diplomacy, and allow the CCP to infiltrate the local political life, something that the PRC, 
if  it were to be a target, would likely qualify as interference. These links can be exploited 
in different ways: on the one hand, the relationships with a governing party can, in some 

A countries, serve as a channel of  influence to the government; on the other, the relationships 
C with one or several opposition parties can be instrumentalized to pressure the government. 
T Essentially, the relationships between parties enhance the knowledge of  the dynam-
O
R ics that characterize the local political life, to identify the potentially exploitable 
S tensions and weaknesses, but also to broadcast the Party’s propaganda and its narratives, 

to defend the Chinese agenda and a positive image of  the country, and to participate in 
targeting potential sources and “useful idiots.” 

Since Xi Jinping came to power, the ILD has multiplied the “presentation sessions” (
宣介会) organized for foreign political personalities,524 officially to respond to a “global 

A demand.” According to that idea, countries apparently want to know China and the CCP 
C better, and to understand why they “succeed.” It is apparently the “new question everyone 
T asks.”525 These presentation sessions are an opportunity to expose the policies led by China, 
I
O their successes, to explain the “spirit” (精神) of  the Party’s congresses, to demonstrate the 
N “unique advantage” (独特优势) of  the Chinese governing system and of  Chinese social-
S ism, and to build a common language.526 The latter is articulated around the rhetoric of  

“community of  common destiny,” guided by the “Chinese dream,” playing the role of  a 
“bridge.” It is materialized in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) (→ p. 150). 

Besides, rather than mere “presentation” sessions, as the name suggests, they are really 
a “recruiting” and building program to rally foreign political parties to the Chinese 
agenda. These “presentation sessions” are organized by the ILD, either in China – inviting 

C foreign political dignitaries -or abroad, sending delegations of  the Party to visit targeted 
A parties directly.

The target countries are, first and foremost, those in the immediate vicinity of  O

Beijing, and those who, historically, are part of  the “Third World” and share the leg- N

acy of  Bandung, in Africa, in the Middle East and in Latin America.527 At the “presentation 
session” organized in Nanchang, Jiangxi, in November 2019, the ILD gathered some 
200 political personalities from about fifty countries to explain the “spirit” (精神) of  C

O
the 4th plenum of  the 19th Party Congress. To salute the Chinese “achievements,” several N
guests took the floor: delegates from the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party, the Democratic C
Party of  Mongolia, the Baas Party in Syria, Cyprus’ Democratic Rally and the Cambodian E

P
People’s Party.528 Several events of  this type were organized at the provincial level to pres- T
ent the Chinese “achievements” on specific themes: the ethnic policy and promotion of  S
interethnic unity and solidarity in Xinjiang in 2019; the rural revitalization policy in Henan 
in 2019; the determining role of  the policy of  reforms and opening in China’s destiny in 
Guangdong in 2018; or even, the promotion of  “high quality” development in Zhejiang in 
2018.529

Attending these “presentation sessions” were delegates of  the Keadilan Party of  Malaysia A
(in the ruling coalition), Indonesia’s National Mandate Party (minority), the Pakistan C

T
Tehreek-e-Insaf  Party (ruling party), the United Hearts Movement of  Central African O
Republic (presidential majority), Botswana’s Democratic Party (ruling party), Communist R
Party of  Vietnam (ruling party), United Russia (ruling party), and of  the Nationalist Party S

of  Malta (opposition).530

As for the delegations sent abroad, their number has significantly grown since 
2013. According to the data collected by Macro Polo, although only six, then ten countries 
received delegations from the ILD in 2013 and 2014, about forty countries were visited 
between November 2015 and March 2016, after the 5th plenum of  the 18th Congress, about A
thirty after the 6th plenum and about sixty after the 19th Congress. This increase reveals the C
Party’s growing interest in that vector of  influence. The visits were conducted by executives T

I
of  the ILD and other structures of  the Party-State such as the State Council, the National O
People’s Congress, the Central Party School of  the CCP, the Propaganda Department, or N
the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.531 S

U
C ered a total of  600 executives of  about 300 political parties and groups from 120 
T
I countries. It was the first summit of  this type since the creation of  the CCP where, in the 
O
N words of  the ILD director Song Tao (宋涛), political leaders from all over the world were 

brought together around the idea of  the creation of  a “community of  common destiny,” 
one of  the leitmotiv of  the Chinese propaganda we mentioned previously (→ p. 149).533 

C The subheading of  the event was: “Build a community of  common destiny and a beauti-
O ful world: the responsibility of  political parties.” And the summit was structured around 
N two plenary sessions and one seminar, in the spirit of  the 19th Congress, followed by four 
C
E conferences on the challenges and the future of  the Party’s consolidation; the Party’s expe-
P rience in the building of  a “beautiful” country; the Party’s contributions in the construction 
T of  the Belt and Road Initiative; the responsibility and the role of  the leader of  the Party in 
S the construction of  a community of  common destiny.534 In his opening speech, Xi Jinping 

announced that the CCP hoped to institutionalize this summit to make it a high level polit-
ical dialogue platform with a large representation and influence at the international level, 
and that a total of  15,000 political personalities of  the entire world would be invited 
to China by the CCP over the next five years.535

A
C The complete list of  foreign delegates at the Summit was apparently not published and 
T only the names of  those who took the floor during the event are known, although we do 
O not have access to the content of  their speeches. The presence and intervention of  Tony 
R
S Parker, treasurer of  the Republican National Committee (RNC) was noticed and con-

demned by the RNC chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, who had allegedly not been 
informed of  his participation, although Parker affirmed had had let her know prior to the 
event.536 Invited and sponsored by the EastWest Institute (EWI), Tony Parker previously 
took part to other events organized by this think tank, which is closely tied to China.537 
In 2016, for instance, he was part of  the American delegation to the 9th edition of  the 

A US-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue.538 Other representatives of  political 
C
T parties already known for their proximity with the CCP also took the floor, such as Serguei

I

such as those between China and the United States (中美政党对话), China and Africa (中 O
N

非政党理论研讨会), China and Asia (中亚政党论坛), and China and Europe (中欧政
党高层论坛).542 In 2017, the China-Africa and China-Asia dialogues held their 3rd and 2nd 
editions respectively. The other two, on the other hand, were launched in 2010. The former C
Democratic Secretary of  State Madeleine Albright and the then-director for Chinese Affairs O
at the State Department, Richard Llewellyn Williams attended the first edition. Additionally, N
the Chinese-American dialogue hosts a bipartisan American delegation approximatively C

E
once a year.543 On December 4, 2017, this dialogue was held around the theme “China P
and the United-States: a New Beginning, New Opportunities, New Cooperation” and the T
American delegates were able to meet Yang Jiechi.544 An 11th edition was held in November S
2019 around the theme “The Chinese and American Political Parties and the China-US 
Relations” with the participation of  Gary Locke, the Democratic former Secretary of  
Commerce in the Obama administration, and first American of  Chinese descent appointed 
ambassador to China; but with Alphonso Jackson also, a Republican former Secretary of  
Housing and Urban Development, already present at the 10th edition.545 These dialogues, A

C

time, mostly representatives of  political parties but also from think tanks and the business O
world.546 R

As for the High-Level Forum of  Political Parties between China and Europe, at least five

ous cities of  China, including Beijing, Tianjin and Suzhou, but also in Brussels. In 2016, the 
5th edition took place in two phases with a first forum in Beijing, followed by an economic 
and commercial dialogue centered around the BRI at Zhengzhou, to which 40 political del-

T
I The objective of  these events is to reach the largest spectrum of  political parties. That is

C Party but also Thierry Mariani, former vice-president of  the French Union for a Popular 
O Movement (UMP).549 In the case of  Germany, the ILD invited Lothar Bisky, former

C
E along with Reinhard Bütikofer, a member of  the German ecologist party Alliance 90/The

As for Irish former minister Dick Roche, who had already commended “China’s spec- T
I

tacular results” and called to increase the cooperation with China,557 he became a consultant O
N

with European institutions, and his main client, Huawei, presumably paid him between 
€100,000 and €200,000 between 2018 and 2019, according to the EU’s transparency regis-
ter,558 which led some media outlets to call him a “Huawei lobbyist.” He was joined by the C
former European diplomat Serge Abou, also on the payroll of  the Chinese company.559 They O
are not the only Europeans who have offered their services – and opened their contact N
books – to Chinese clients. In its attempt to win the Estonian market for the construc- C

E
tion of  the 5G network, Huawei turned to the PR consultant company Powerhouse, which P
employed three former Estonian ministers: the company’s co-founder Janek Mäggi, a T
former public administration minister, Marko Pomerants and Andres Anvelts, who both S
occupied several ministerial positions, including at the ministry of  the interior.560 According 
to Re: Baltica, Pomerants and Mäggi sought to open the doors of  the Estonian government 
to Huawei by mobilizing their personal network: Pomerants’s party (Isamaa) was in the 
ruling power coalition at the time.561 A member of  the Estonian Social Democratic Party, 
and a former participant to the China-Europe Forum organized by the ILD, Randel Länts A

C
managed the “government relations” pole in the consulting company Miltton, which sup- T
posedly offered PR services to the Chinese Embassy in Tallinn.562 In fact, Central and O
Eastern European countries are specifically targeted by the ILD, who has organized R

S
two types of  forums for this region (→ p. 310): the Dialogue Between Political Parties of  
China and Central and Eastern Europe (中国- 中东欧政党对话会), in Budapest in 2016 
and Bucharest in 2017, but also the Forum of  Young Political Leaders of  China and Central 
and Eastern Europe (中国与中东欧青年政治家论坛), in Beijing in 2015, which invited 
Mailis Reps, an Estonian Centre Party minister of  education and research, among others.563 

Maintaining direct relations with influential politicians in any country opens the A
doors to infiltrating its societies, collecting official and unofficial support, and to C

T
bypassing potential blockages inside the structures of  power using opposition or I
“retired” politicians. The Party already prides itself  that China’s position on the South O
China Sea is supported by “over 120 states, 240 political groups and parties, and 280 think N

S
tanks and NGOs” across the world, the result of  an effective “party diplomacy.”564 Others 
have expressed support for the Chinese policy in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, or praised the 
BRI. Such support often comes from political parties with ideals close to the CCP’s, such as 
Cyprus’ Progressive Party of  Working People (AKEL), a “communist ally” and one of  the

N tation sessions.”566 More recently, a dozen political leaders supposedly sent congratulation 

messages to the ILD to praise the Chinese management of  the Covid-19 crisis.567 Besides, 
the ILD organized a video-conference in June 2020, as part of  the “CCP in Dialogue” 

C Summit, with communist parties from Latin America countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chili, 
O Cuba, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela) on “the Strengths of  Popular Philosophy of  the CCP 
N and its Response to Covid-19” – which sets the tone of  the discussion.568 
C
E Furthermore, this party diplomacy improves the Chinese’s understanding of  
P national events. In 2014, exchanges between the ILD and a delegation from the Estonian 
T Parliament, presided by Marko Mihkelson, focused, among other things, on the situation 
S in Ukraine. It enabled the Chinese to better understand how the United States and its allies 

reacted to the Russian aggression, and, as such, helped them think about their own actions 
in Hong Kong, in the South China Sea, and vis-à-vis Taiwan.569

Another objective of  this “Party diplomacy” is to reinforce China’s discursive power 
at the international level.570 When China calls for the development of  a new “common 

A
C language” across the world, it evidently does not refer to any common language, but its 
T own, of  which the key words are “community of  common destiny,” “win-win cooperation,” 
O “new international order,” “international peace,” “world development,” and so on.571 The 
R more political leaders and other influential personalities adopt this vocabulary, even if  they 
S do not endorse what it really means for the Chinese, the more China’s discursive power, its 

capacity to impose its narratives on China and the world is strengthened. By imposing its 
elements of  speech, the Party shapes the debate, builds filters and interpretation 
schemes that favor it.572 The Party also seeks to impose a “good” image of  China and to 
tell the “right” stories regarding China. Several pages of  the ILD’s website titled “Stories 

A of  the CCP” (中国共产党的故事), explain, for instance, China’s various “achievements” 
C
T in different domains.573 The Chinese make sure to use a discourse that can be echoed at the 
I international level, and that foreign audience can easily accept.574

Beyond the advantages stemming from tightening relations with foreign political parties, D

tribution to further the world political civilization.”575 To quote the words used by China, 
this kind of  event is, indeed, an occasion to put forward CCP’s “political advantage” (政治 C
优势), and to show its “worldwide influence capacity” (世界影响力),576 without necessar- O

3. Priority to investments in the regions P
T

The Canadian case (→ p. 539) illustrates the fact that Chinese efforts towards foreign S
political circles are often directed primarily towards the local and regional levels, which 
are more accessible and discreet targets, and make it possible to cover the territory 
and be as close as possible to the population.

In France, as elsewhere, the Chinese Embassy lobbies MPs and senators intensively, 
and organizes regional events with local political authorities, who are often in demand. A
This is notably the case of  the Hauts-de-France region, which has notably developed its C

T
relations with China. Every year since 2017, it has invited the Chinese ambassador to cele- O
brate the Chinese New Year in a large ceremony in Lille.578 On January 13, 2020, the event R
was co-organized with the Confucius Institute of  the University of  Artois.579 For the same S

reasons that favor decentralization in its influence efforts, Beijing is particularly seeking to 
locate its Confucius institutes and classes in medium-sized universities (→ p. 300). 

The Hauts-de-France region has also entered into an agreement with China’s Zhejiang 
province (September 2019) as well as between the ports of  Dunkirk and Ningbo (April 
2019). A

C Influencing federated and decentralized actors: the German example
T
I In Germany, Berlin is not the best environment to observe and analyze China’s interferences. 
O The federal organization of  Germany de facto renders it far more vulnerable to inter-
N ference at the Länder level (Bavaria and Bada-Wurtemberg where companies are particularly 

exposed to the Chinese market, as well as North-Rhine-Westphalia with Duisburg, a Chinese-
style smart city). 
No study at the local level has been conducted, in North-Rhine-Westphalia for instance, to 

C establish a precise map of  the numerous Chinese initiatives, apparently under the cover of  
O business development, and the economic-financial interdependencies stemming from it (busi-
N ness trips, economic partnerships, R&D, university programs). Duisburg (a project of  digital 
C city, or smart city580) and Gelsenkirchen are often pointed out as vulnerable due to their finan-
E cial situations (in the Ruhr region) and partnerships with Chinese companies such as Huawei 
P (Duisburg)
T The difficulty comes from the decentralized political power and its federal character, which lim-
S it any attempt at centralizing information, and hence any coordinated federal policy response. 

For foreign actors, Germany’s decentralization is a “windfall for influence actions.”581 
In addition, parts of  the partnerships (such as the Thousand Talents program (→ p. 292), sup-
port to study programs, etc.) are not covered by the 2018 German law on foreign investment, 
because they are not participations in a company’s capital or joint-ventures.582 
The different political cultures in Germany, between the East and the West, even thirty years 

A after the fall of  the Berlin Wall, favor the permeability to CCP narratives. The foothold of  the 
C AfD and Die Linke parties, both vectors of  greater acceptance of  authoritarian discourses 
T than in the West, is doubled with a tendency to use a narrative of  victimization in a part of  the 
O electorate (Ossis, victims of  the West). This is, in fine, a more permissive and vulnerable 
R environment for the actions of  Chinese actors and their relays – highlighting the discrim-
S inations supposedly faced by China and its companies.

B. People

C
T “What other country, besides China, coopts as many former leaders from all over the 
I planet?”583 Le Canard enchaîné asked after listing two former French Prime Minister (Jean-
O Pierre Raffarin et Dominique de Villepin), one former British Prime Minister (David 
N
S Cameron), a former German vice-Chancellor (Philippe Rösler) and one former Australian 

Prime Minister (Paul Keating) – a list far from exhaustive that encompasses practically 
every country. As was previously mentioned, in Estonia for instance, “the Powerhouse 
company, which was lobbying in the name of  the Chinese company Huawei, employs three 
former Estonian ministers”584 (→ p. 259).

The Chinese Communist Party has always forged links with politicians from 
C countries whose positions, or at least, whose representations of  China, they wished to 
A influence. These practices were also part of  the Soviet repertoire of  active measures and 
S are among United Front activities. In the Chinese case, the ILD plays an important role in 
E this type of  operations as it is responsible for maintaining most of  the bilateral relations 

with political parties.

It can be noted, however, that the CCP has made increasingly important efforts regard- D
U

ing targets that could be particularly useful. One method seen in Australia,585 but also in C

European institutions, consists in appointing advisors close to Western politicians. T
I

Charles Parton thus reported that, during the visit of  European MEPs in Beijing, a “British O
N

deputy had brought his advisor, a former Chinese professor, to an internal meeting, and 
had defended positions that differed little, or not at all, from the Propaganda department’s 
documents. Said advisor is well known in Brussels for organizing pro-China events.”586

C
The ties can be varied: some politicians are only contacts to Chinese agents using them O

to transmit messages or influence opinions; another circle is composed of  politicians who N
can be manipulated, based on their ideology or sheer interest: they are “useful idiots”; a C

E
third group is composed of  individuals fully aware of  working for Chinese interests and P
who accept it, whatever the reason may be. They are actual influence agents that Beijing T
can trust with more specific directives; finally, the last circle, closest to the Party, is com- S
posed of  those formally recruited by Chinese intelligence services. When politicians 
stay out of  reach from Beijing’s efforts, the Party can use intimidation or punitive actions 
(one of  its most common weapons being visa denial, used against researchers [→ p. 285] 
but also against recalcitrant politicians). The level of  penetration and the number of  pol-
iticians under influence greatly vary from country to country. Many cases are known in A

C
Australia and New Zealand, but the phenomenon touches everyone, everywhere. T

In Germany for instance, Bundestag politicians, MPs and ex-MPs from all parties, O
are courted by companies or the embassy: from the CDU-CSU (Hans-Peter Friedrich R

S
(CDU), vice-president of  Bundestag is seen as pro-China) through exchange programs ded-
icated to young talents, to the FDP, SPD, or the AfD. The B’90-Grünen is the only group 
that seems to stay impermeable to these actions of  influence (except for Jürgen Trittin), due 
to the prominence of  human rights issues and to its core environmentalist ideology. The 
case of  SPD deputies of  the Bundestag Commission for Human Right, prohibited from 
entering the territory and denied entry visas in 2018, is often mentioned as an example A
of  a visible, voluntary action. This initiative falls within a networking-lobbying approach C

T
brought about by several lead executives of  German companies (Siemens, VW, etc.), all part I
of  the DAX of  the China-Brücke, and based on the model of  the Transatlantik-Brücke; it O
shows that those who are pro-China still favor dialogue and see Beijing as an unavoidable N

S
trade partner (→ p. 252).587

C When a German MP hijacks a Chinese communication operation with some irony
T
I In 2018, more than 100 Bundestag MPs received copies of  the English edition of  Xi Jinping’s 
O recently-published China’s Governance II. The shipment was decided by a German marketing 
N agency (Beijing makes extensive use of  local communication and marketing agencies and lob-

byists to try to improve its image). The letter accompanying the book informed the MPs that 
it was free of  charge but asked them in return to “display the books in their constituencies 
and send a photo to an e-mail address of  the agency.”588 CDU MP Michael Brand, who is no 

C stranger to Beijing, had an idea. He has specialized in the protection of  religious minorities 
O and has been known for his outspokenness toward the CCP, which made him persona non grata 
N in China after he refused to answer the Chinese ambassador to Germany’s demand to censor 
C his own website two years earlier (the ambassador asked him to remove photos and texts about 
E the persecution of  religious minorities). When he received Xi Jinping’s book and the request 
P to display and photograph it, Brand did so: he displayed the books on a shelf, alongside books 
T dedicated to crimes committed by the CCP or to resistant figures, such as the Dalai Lama and 
S the artist Ai Weiwei. He took a photo (below) and sent it back to the sender.

In the Czech Republic, another interesting European example, Chinese influence on 
politicians has reached new heights. MapInfluenCE described a massive penetration of  
Czech political networks,589 the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) most specifi-
cally. The links between this party and the CCP pre-date the election of  President Miloš 

C
A Zeman, and rest on a few key individuals such as Jan Hamáček, who leads the party, 
S or Jan Kohout, a presidential advisor who was appointed head of  the New Silk Road 
E Institute Prague in 2015. According to MapInfluenCE, the social-democrats also harbor 

politically-involved entrepreneurs who use this platform to develop ties with the CCP 
or structures related to it. This influence can be illustrated by Jaroslav Tvrdík, a ČSSD 
former MP and defense minister in the governments of  Miloš Zeman and Vladimír 
Špidla. He was vice-president of  the board of  directors of  the Chinese company CEFC 

C
O in Europe between 2015 and 2020.

The close links between Tvrdík and China date back to at least 2012, when he became D
U

president of  the supervisory board of  the Czech-China Chamber of  Mutual Cooperation, C

and then chairman of  its board of  directors two years later.590 Tvrdík subsequently became T
I

an advisor for Jiří Rusnok and Bohuslav Sobotka, prime ministers from 2013 to 2014 and O
N

from 2014 to 2017 respectively, on issues regarding China.591 In 2015, the Chinese conglom-
erate CEFC Group Europe set up its European headquarters in Prague, and launched an 
aggressive acquisition drive that targeted numerous Czech companies: J&T Finance Group, C
the airline Travel Group, the multimedia group Empresa Media, and even the football club O
SK Slavia Prague. Jaroslav Tvrdík, who was appointed vice-president of  CEFC Europe, N
played a key role in the majority of  these acquisitions. He also became chairman of  the C

E
supervisory board of  SK Slavia Prague in 2015, and then chairman of  its board of  directors P
in 2016. The president and founder of  CEFC, Ye Jianming was, on his part, appointed T
political and economic advisor to the Czech president Milos Zeman.592 In 2017, this S
progression was hit by a scandal when CEFC was accused by the U.S. Justice Department 
of  having bribed the Chadian president with €2 million in exchange for oil exploitation 
rights. Furthermore, CEFC China Energy was not able to pay its debt obligations, esti-
mated at €475 million, to J&T Private Investments on time. Hence, J&T obtained the 
shareholder rights and appointed a new president.593 Ye Jianming was eventually arrested in A

C
China in late 2018 on charges of  corruption and economic crimes.594 T

The CITIC company, controlled by the Chinese government and, “for several specialists, O
an extraordinary den of  intelligence officers,”595 took control of  CEFC and managed to R

S
recover the group’s presidency by settling parts of  its debt.596 Tvrdík was again appointed 
vice-chairman of  CEFC Europe.597 Tvrdík is also seemingly tied to the supervisory board 
of  the Traditional Chinese Medicine Foundation (TMC) which, as we saw, is one of  Beijing’s 
influence tools (→ p. 152). Finally, he owns shares (25%) in the firm Little Mole Cartoon 
which, in 2016, coproduced with CCTV a 52-episode TV show depicting the little Czech 
mole and the Giant Chinese panda preparing the visit of  Xi Jinping in Prague.598 That sole A
example shows how the CCP manages to turn local politicians in true agents, capable C

T
of  infiltrating the political society of  a nation. I

The visit of  the president of  Czech Parliament in Taiwan U
C
T

On January 10, 2020, the Chinese Ambassador in Prague sent a threatening letter to the I
then-president of  the parliament, Jaroslav Kubera, second most important political figure in O
the country, to dissuade him from going on his planned visit to Taiwan. The letter stated that, N

if  need be, retaliatory measures would be taken against Czech companies in China, such as 
Skoda Auto and Home Credit Group. In the end, Kubera could not see his project through – 
he died from a cardiac arrest ten days later, on January 20. His successor, Miloš Vystrčil, was 
subjected to equal pressure but he did not fold: he partook in a particularly mediatized official C
visit in Taiwan, at the head of  a delegation of  90 people, from August 30 to September 4, 2020. O
The Chinese Minister of  Foreign Affairs Wang Yi immediately reacted to Prague crossing a N
“red line”; he hence announced that the country would pay a “heavy price” for this insult.599 C
Several days later, Song Tao (宋涛), the head of  the ILD (→ p. 70), asked the president of  the E
central committee of  the Czech Communist Party of  Bohemia and Moravia (KSČM), Vojtěch P
Filip, to distance himself  from Vystrčil.600 The country’s president Zeman subsequently an- T
nounced that he would do the same.601 S
The president of  the parliament was also targeted by a defamation campaign, with misinfor-
mation stating that he had been paid $4 million by Taiwan for the visit, a sum supposedly 
meant to finance a future presidential campaign. The media Aktuálně.cz received messages 
from Michael Winkler and Robert J. Mojzes, representing the Swiss consulting firm RefinSol 
Advisory Services, inviting them to publish this (fake) news. Aktuálně.cz inquired about the 
informants and established that they were also behind eurasiainfo.ch, which seemingly relays A
information from the Chinese Embassy in Switzerland.602 Winkler also wrote pro-Beijing ar- C
ticles (one was titled “Xi Jinping: a Responsible Leader in Switzerland,” in which he praised T
the Chinese president for the “depth of  his knowledge on the historical ties” between the O
two countries and “the clarity and fairness of  his objectives” during his visit).603 According to R
University of  Basel Professor Ralph Weber, the RefinSol Advisory Services and eurasiainfo.ch S
offices are both located next to an association for overseas Chinese from the Jiangxi province 
headed by Zhu Ailian (朱爱莲), who runs eurasiainfo.ch with Winkler and Moizes. They seem 
close to the CCP: on a picture on the European Jiangxi Chamber of  Commerce website, that 
she also runs, she poses with the Chinese vice-president, Wang Qishan.604

A
C

The CCP also seems very active within the Italian political class, targeting the M5S T
in particular.605 The situation is judged even more worrying since the Italian Ministry of  I

O
Foreign Affairs has little resources on China. In addition, the Minister of  Foreign Affairs, N

D Party, the construction of  a Chinese network within the French elite runs through the 
U
C France-China Foundation since 2013. According to its staff, the foundation’s “Young 
T
I Leaders” program aims to “promote the meeting of  high potential individuals from China 
O
N and France from diverse background (economic, political, cultural, media), who will play 

an important role in their home country or in the context of  China-France relations.” The 
foundation was created by Emmanuel Lenain, Arnaud Ventura, Nicolas Macquin and Shan 

C Sa on the French side.607 “‘The profiles are screened,’ recognized Nicolas Macquin. ‘There is 
O a division within the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs – the Institute of  Foreign Affairs 
N of  the Chinese people – that controls all these exchange and cooperation programs.’ The 
C
E ministry itself  lists the participants. Sponsoring the program, it ensures that one of  its 
P representatives is included in each of  the sessions. They are Beijing’s eye, in some ways.”608 
T If  the list of  the sessions reveals judicious choices among the French elite, the same can-
S not be said about the Chinese elite. In fact, this type of  structure serves, first and foremost, 

China’s interest by favoring the emergence of  positive perceptions of  China among the 
recipients and the creation of  a reserve army from which the Party can draw to lead 
its influence operations. In China, the foundation is tied to the Chinese People’s Institute 
of  Foreign Affairs (中国人民外交学会), which was created by Zhou Enlai (周恩来) in 

A
C 1949 to put in place a people-to-people diplomacy – in other words, to open more channels 
T toward foreign elites. Today, the institute works within the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and 
O ensures the ideological compatibility of  selected French individuals. The Chinese system 
R is not very different from how the Soviets used to send delegations abroad to pro-
S vide the KGB with avenues of  penetration in targeted societies and to facilitate the 

selection of  potential “useful idiots.” 
This strategy of  recruiting current or retired foreign politicians is led simultaneously to 

the ILD’s activities specifically targeting political parties.

O Chinese electoral interferences have long existed (there were allegations of  illegal Chinese

elections in 7 countries over the past decade, an majority of  which took place in the 
Indo-Pacific region (Australia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan),610 
the only other country being the United States. To this list a few local elections in Canada 
can be added, as voters were encouraged, via WeChat, to vote for certain candidates of  
Chinese descent in exchange for money (→ p. 562).

circles. They have been deemed matters of  national interests.

C
E
P It is fairly easy to understand why foreign universities are one of  the main targets of  
T Chinese influence operations: “the CCP has a deep understanding of  the importance 
S of  ideas and ideological struggle in the contest for political power, so ideas and 

those who generate them are a central target of  the CCP’s influence work.”614

1. Financial dependence vis-à-vis China
A Third preferred destination in the world for international students, after the United 
C
T States and the United Kingdom, Australia is, by far, the country that welcomes the most 
O students as a proportion of  its population (1,559 for 100,000 inhabitants, compared to 653 
R for the United Kingdom, 517 for Canada, 379 for France and 304 for the United States).615 
S International students are very important for Australia, as the revenues they bring (tuition 

fees, contributions to the economy), tens of  billions of  Australian dollars, represent the 
third source of  revenues for the country in the export market, after minerals. 

And Chinese students represent, by far, the first contingent (60% on average for 
the eight most prestigious Australian universities, even 69% for the University of  Sydney, 

A 66% at the University of  New South Wales, and 56% at the University of  Melbourne).616 
C In some programs and classes, they even represent a strong majority of  students, with pos-
T
I sible adverse effects: when 80% of  the students are Chinese, as is the case in some MBAs, 
O other students are dissuaded from attending (young Australians choose North America or 
N Europe instead), insofar as everyone speaks Chinese in class and it is of  lesser interest in 
S terms of  networking, which is one of  the main motivations for this kind of  program.

In any case Chinese students generated AUS$534 million (€340 million) at the University 
of  Sydney (23% of  its total revenue) in 2017, 446 million (€285 million) at the University 
of  New South Wales (22 %) and 410 million (€262 million) at the University of  Melbourne 
(16 %).617 In other words, in some cases, close to a quarter of  their revenues comes from 
Chinese students, without counting funding from Chinese companies. These proportions 

C
A have made universities – some more than others – dependent on Chinese students. It is 
S even more salient with the decreasing public subsidies from the government. 
E However, after an uninterrupted growth since 2010 (about +10% per year on average), 

the number of  study permits delivered to Chinese has stagnated between 2017 and 2018, 
before decreasing between 2018 and 2019 (-3.3%). This tendency stems from various fac-

tors, including the development, and thus increased attractiveness, of  Chinese universities, D
U

but also the bilateral tensions since 2017-2018 – approximately when Australia became C

more cognizant to the “existential” threat that China’s influence represents (→ p. 544). T
I

This dependence on Chinese students in Australian universities is, in fact, representative O
N

of  Australia’s overall dependence to China. It is similar to how Beijing weaponizes the num-
ber of  tourists in some areas (→ p. 405); it uses students to pressure Australia. In June 
2020, the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs issued a warning advising Chinese students C
not to go to Australia due to Covid-19-related risks, but also to the “racial discrimination” O
they presumably face in the country.618 The economic consequences of  a drastic fall in the N
number of  Chinese students in Australia have created pressing concerns in the country, for C

E
which the only solution is to break the dependency – in other words, to diversify (→ p. 273). P

The Australian case is the most spectacular, but is far from being the only one. Other T
countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, are fac- S
ing the same problem. The United Kingdom does not have such a big Chinese diaspora 
(0.7% of  the population),619 but its main vulnerability regarding influence resides precisely 
in the fact that its universities welcome “more Chinese students than the rest of  Europe 
combined.”620 The financial dependence toward Chinese students increased throughout the 
last decade. Since 2014-15, their number went from 89,540 to 120,385, a 34% increase in A

C
five years.621 It is, by far, the largest non-European student group (three times more than T
Indians). About fifteen universities earn over a fifth of  their income from them. According O
to the Global Times, the United Kingdom has become a more popular destination than the R

S
United States for Chinese students.622 Just like everywhere else, the richest schools, such 
as Oxford or Cambridge, have the resources to resist and Beijing has more leverage on 
universities where Chinese students are the most numerous, Nottingham and the LSE for 
instance. The situation is similar in the United States (329,000 Chinese students in 2017, 
over five times more than ten years ago)623 and in Canada (→ p. 567). 

Essentially, this financial dependence, sometimes reinforced by the presence of  a A
Confucius Institute (→ p. 299), renders these universities less susceptible to resist C

T
Chinese influence operations. On the contrary, it pushes them to actively partici- I
pate in self-censorship, to avoid saying or doing things that displease Beijing. “We don’t O
bite the hand that feeds us,” replied the hierarchy of  a professor at an Australian uni- N

S
versity when he expressed his concerns about the safety of  Hong Kong students.624 All 
the more so since, within its dissuasion arsenal, Beijing has other ways to pressure them, 
including cyberattacks. The attack that targeted the Australian National University (ANU) 
in Canberra at the end of  2018, revealed in June 2019, and that allowed the responsible 
parties to steal the personal information of  thousands of  students and staff  members, was 
not officially attributed, but its target and degree of  sophistication presupposed a level of  C
skills that only a few states had. A

T Two cases at Charles University, the oldest University in Central Europe
I
O The prestigious Charles University in Czech Republic, the oldest in Central Europe, was the 
N target of  at least two Chinese influence operations. 

– The Balabán case. In 2015, a Chinese-Czech center was created at Charles University, in 
Prague, with Miloš Balabán as secretary general. He was not entirely unknown to the Czech 

C security and intelligence service (BIS), which, in their 2013 annual report, noted that the 9th 
O Prague Security conference, organized by Balabán, showcased a certain leniency regarding 
N the activities of  Russian and Chinese intelligence services but an eagerness to denounce the 
C activities of  the Czechs’ American ally.625 In 2015, Balabán, who was cumulating his new po-
E sition at the China-Czech center with that of  director of  another of  the university’s research 
P center, the Center for Security Policy, created a private namesake company (Center for Security 
T Policy). Through this private company, China financed the annual conferences of  the China-
S Czech center in 2018 and 2019, for approximately €47,000. The objective of  the financial ar-

rangement was apparently caution, enabling Balabán to not mention the Chinese money when 
questioned on how the 2019 conference was funded: it was paid by the China-Czech center 
(€20,000) and other participants (€2,300), he replied, omitting to highlight that China was its 
main contributor (€23,500).626 When it was revealed, Balabán resigned from both centers at the 
university. It was later uncovered that in 2018, Balabán had volunteered a university course on 
the BRI, which he co-taught, and at the end of  which the eight best students were offered a 

A free trip to China through the Bridge for the Future program. The class was allegedly invoiced 
C not to the university but, through his private company, to the Embassy of  China, who paid 
T him €2,700.627

O – The PPF case. PPF (První Privatizační Fond) is an important Czech financial group, “the 
R richest private company in the Czech Republic,”628 which owns Home Credit, a company 
S that makes most of  its profit in China. It seems, however, that Beijing had put a condition 

to its access to the Chinese market: an improvement of  the relationships between the Czech 
Republic and China. For that reason, and to convince Beijing, PPF worked hard to “help flip 
the government’s anti-communist foreign policy into a pro-China one.” They notably “ar-
ranged a Beijing visit by Czech President Milos Zeman in 2014, even supplying a private jet to 
fly him back.”629 The efforts paid off: that same year, Home Credit was granted access to the 
Chinese market, with important financial benefits. At the start of  October 2019, Home Credit 

A offered to sponsor Charles University if  it signed an agreement to “not hurt PPF’s global 
C interests,” which essentially “translated that the university would have to stop all criticisms 
T toward China.” However, “Charles University has many influential critics of  China in its staff, 
I including Martin Hala and his organization Sinopsis, an institution that has examined and ex-
O posed the Czech Republic’s questionable dealings with Beijing. Within days of  learning about 
N Home Credit’s sponsorship agreement with Charles University, students, faculty and Czech 
S media lambasted the university’s leadership, prompting Home Credit to withdraw its offer and 

the head of  the university to publicly apologize for his role in the matter.”630

Aware of  their vulnerabilities, Australian universities and the government are organizing D
U

themselves. In August 2019, they created a University Foreign Interference Taskforce with C

government and university representatives. This group published guidelines for Australian T
I

universities in November. To reduce the Chinese influence, they generally encouraged O
N

the diversification of  students (such as Indian students, whose enrollment has increased 
a lot recently, although it remains far from the volume represented by the Chinese – they 
are also less solvent; Australia being on the same segment as the United Kingdom, Brexit C
could benefit Australian universities by redirecting a part of  the flow of  Indian students), O
increased subsidies from the government and Australian businesses; and red-lined N
strategic topics (AI, quantum computing, engineering – but it generated a debate, insofar C

E
as, due to the Chinese head start there, depriving the country of  such collaborations could P
be scientifically damaging). T

Finally, it should be remembered that the financial pressure – without necessarily going S
as far as dependence – is exerted via the income generated not only by the presence 
of  Chinese students but also by Chinese funding for laboratories, research, events or 
teaching programs, especially in Chinese language. In Germany, for example, the Free 
University of  Berlin signed a contract with Hanban (the Chinese organization that manages 
Confucius Institutes → p. 299) granting it nearly €500,000 over five years to train some 20 A

C
Chinese language teachers each year. The contract contains clauses allowing Beijing to exert T
political pressure on the content of  the teaching, notably by offering the Chinese side the O
possibility of  reducing or suspending its financing if  it considers that certain elements of  R

S
the program are contrary to Chinese law, or of  revoking the contract with more advanta-
geous conditions than if  the university does.631 There are many more or less formalized 
and binding agreements. In a small country like Slovakia, which is part of  a region (the 
Visegrád group, and more broadly Central and Eastern Europe) that is strategic for Beijing 
(→ p. 310), no less than 113 formal relationships have been identified between Chinese 
entities (universities but also other organizations such as the Chinese Academy of  Social A
Sciences or Hanban, and companies such as Huawei and ZTE), and Slovak universities and C

T
research institutes. The peak was reached in 2016-2017, with ten new agreements signed I
yearly.632 O

2. Academic freedom and freedom of  expression on campuses

Many of  the hundreds of  thousands of  Chinese students on foreign campus are nation-
alists. In Australia for instance, “the vast majority of  them are Chinese government sup-
porters.”633 And some have been particularly zealous and aggressive, if  not violent. They 
create problems, particularly, but not only, by attempting to restrict academic liberties and 
freedom of  expression in the university community, starting with that of  their Chinese C

A
peers. It is important to emphasize that this latter attitude only concerns a minority of  S
them – especially since some Chinese students choose these countries precisely because E
they want to escape the Chinese regime, at least temporarily, breathe a little, and taste the 
freedom offered by democracies. The primary objective of  this active minority is to

N a. Surveillance and intimidation of  Chinese students. 

Chinese students abroad are one of  the priority targets identified by Xi Jinping 
at the United Front Work Conference in 2015 (with the New Media, young entrepreneurs 

C and intellectuals not members of  the Party).634 The reason is simple: “the CCP makes 
O extensive efforts to keep overseas students in line partly because it is anxious that 
N
C they may be ‘infected’ by Western ideas.”635 They are, as such, constantly monitored by 
E others among them. In South Korea where about 40% of  foreign students are Chinese, 
P “there is a saying among the teachers: ‘at least one of  your Chinese students is an 
T
S informant.’”636 It is likely true. Chinese studying abroad, in the United States, in Australia, 

or elsewhere, revealed that their parents in China had been informed and questioned on the 
fact that their child had gone to a class in which they had said this or that. The director of  
Human Rights Watch for China mentioned the case of  a graduated student who spoke of  
something in a closed seminar on the campus of  an American university, and two days later, 

A his parents in China received a visit from the Ministry of  Public Security “asking why their 
C kid had brought up these touchy topics that were embarrassing to China in a classroom in 
T the U.S.”637 This is the proof  that informants in class do not only protest to attempt to 
O
R influence class materials and campus activities, but in fact partake in a practical and 
S permanent surveillance, relay these information (who said what, where, and in front of  

whom) to the authorities, likely through the consulate or the embassy, who then relay them 
to Beijing for potential measures to be taken, in the form of  pressure on the parents – the 
whole circuit happening in 48 hours, which indicates a rather well-oiled system. 

This puts the teachers in an ethical dilemma, explained Kevin Carrico, who teaches 
A China studies at Monash University in Australia: on the one hand, as a teacher in a free 
C country, he does not want to make concessions on the content; on the other hand, what he 
T says in class, or what his students say in class, is surveilled and relayed to Chinese authorities 
I and the families. How to protect students without compromising on the content?638 
O
N Surveillance is also constant outside the classroom, especially during demonstra-
S tions. Chinese students, some of  whom have chosen Australia to enjoy greater freedom, 

are watched as if  they were still in China, primarily by some of  their peers, but also by 
embassy and consulate officials and numerous party-related organizations. Here is a typical 
student testimony: “When I came to Australia, I thought I would finally be able to demon-
strate freely. During [a] demonstration [in Melbourne, against the treatment of  Chinese 
doctors and journalists who tried to alert the public about Covid-19], someone took my 

C picture, which later ended up on WeChat. Then I got a video call from my parents, who 
A were at the police station. The policeman told me that I had to go back to China and turn 
S
E myself  in, that what I had done was illegal and anti-Chinese.” The student does not dare to 

go back home anymore and she has “also stopped talking to [her] parents to avoid putting 
them in danger.”639

Intimidation is even stronger with regard to at least two categories of  students. D
U

On the one hand, scholarship recipients (in France, for example, there are 1,400 schol- C

arship recipients out of  30,000 Chinese students640), because they are financially dependent T
I

on Beijing and therefore cannot refuse anything to the embassy or the Party. On the other O
N

hand, minority students (notably Uyghurs and Tibetans) and/or protest movements 
(such as the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong). And this is true no matter where 
in the world they are. The Party manages to exert pressure on them, most often via their C
relatives, their parents, who remain in China. A Uyghur student at a university in western O
France explained: “The [Chinese] police ask me what I’m doing [by e-mail and telephone], N
whether I’ve participated in activities, whether I see other Uyghurs. I have to keep send- C

E
ing copies of  my documents, taking pictures of  myself  in front of  my college. If  I don’t P
answer, they come to my parents’ house in Xinjiang.”641 T

On campuses, intimidation frequently goes as far as physical aggression. Over S
the summer 2019, the Hong Kong crisis reached Australian and New Zealander universi-
ties. Several times, particularly on the campuses of  Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart 
and Auckland, the same scenario repeated itself: pacific demonstrations of  pro-Hong Kong 
democracy students were interrupted by pro-Beijing students yelling nationalist songs, such 
as “China is great,” and ripping signs and posters. It sometimes escalated, particularly on A

C
the campus of  the University of  Queensland (UQ), in Brisbane, where 300 pro-Beijing T
students physically attacked the pro-democracy protestors, dealing hits, before the police O
intervened. The Chinese consulate later issued a statement praising the “patriotic R

S
behavior” of  the students, which led to a reaction from the minister of  Defense, calling 
foreign diplomats to not interfere. In fact, UQ has strong ties to the consulate: the consul 
himself  was appointed guest professor that same month (July 2019).642 Moreover, pro-Bei-
jing actors use WeChat groups to mobilize people before pro-democracy gatherings they 
are aware of, to fight “the separatist forces to the end” and “never make a concession.”643

Harassment also takes place online: pro-democracy students are targeted by hate A
campaigns and frequently threatened. Drew Pavlou, a 20-year-old UQ student, and one of  C

T
the main organizers of  pro-democracy protests in favor of  Hong Kong, received dozens I
of  death threats. In a message, a user told him he would hire an assassin in the Deep Web O
to kill his family (picture below). Others had their “driver’s license, marriage certificate, stu- N

S
dent ID and other identifying information published on Chinese social media site Weibo”644 
– this practice, called doxing, is developed in a separate section (→ p. 397).

b. Intimidation of  professors and university administrators 
Chinese students are not the only ones targeted. Professors, university administra-

tors, and staff  members are also constantly surveilled and intimidated to make sure 
that life on the campus, including teachings and research programs, is compliant with the 

C CCP’s line. 
A
S In the American case, a detailed report of  the Wilson Center noted in 2018 that “a small 
E number of  PRC students have infringed on the academic freedom of  American university 

faculty, students, administrators, and staff  in recent years by: demanding the removal of  
research, promotional and decorative materials involving [considered by the PRC as] sen-
sitive content from university spaces; demanding faculty alter their language or teaching 
materials involving [considered by the PRC as] sensitive content on political rather than

American universities by: monitoring people and activities on campus involving [consid-
ered by the PRC as] sensitive content; probing faculty for information in a suspicious man-

welcome a relatively important number of  Chinese students. N

The University of  New South Wales censored itself  under Chinese pressure P
T

On July 31, 2020, the University of  New South Wales S
(UNSW) published a quote from a professor at the univer-
sity (who was also director of  Human Rights Watch 
Australia), on its Twitter account, to “bring attention to the 
fast escalation of  the situation in Hong Kong.” This tweet 
brought about protests from Chinese students, who were 
particularly numerous in this university where they amount- A
ed to close to a quarter of  total enrollments, 69% of  inter- C
national students, and whose tuition fees equalled 22% of  T
the university’s budget (which, in addition, had important O
deals, approximating AUS$60 million (€38 million), with R
Chinese companies). This power unbalance quickly pushed S
the university to its first concession, tweeting a few hours 
later that “the opinions expressed by our academics do not 
always represent the views of  UNSW,” before deleting 
both tweets. The original article where the quote was taken 
from was also removed from the website – after Chinese 
students asked the embassy to pressure the university. 
According to the Global Times, deleting the tweets was not A
enough to calm the students, who asked the university to C

publish an apology.647 This deletion quickly became a national polemic, with MPs, along with T
the minister for education, considering that this self-censorship infringed on the freedom of  I
expression and on academic freedom (which should be particularly protected in universities). O
It is another example of  the unacceptable influence of  China on Australian campuses.648 N

Notably, any link with the Dalai Lama causes a systematic reaction. This is true 
for countries (following a visit by the Dalai Lama in Copenhagen in 2009, Beijing froze its 
bilateral relations with Denmark until the government issued a statement defending that 
Denmark “was opposed to Tibet’s independence”), but also universities. When in 2009, 
the University of  Calgary granted the title of  doctor honoris causa to the Dalai Lama, the C
Chinese government retaliated by removing the university from its list of  school recog- A

S
nized by China, which caused the departure of  many Chinese students, fearing they would E
not find a job in China because their degrees at the University of  Calgary were no longer 
recognized. Punished during two years, the University was recertified in 2011.649 When in

less than 1,600 comments, some of  which accused the Dalai Lama of  being a “terrorist.”650

When, in 2016, in France, INALCO (the National Institute for Eastern Languages 
A
C and Civilizations) invited the Dalai Lama to give a conference, the university “received 
T official letters from the Embassy of  China demanding that the invitation be rescinded,” 
I always with the barely veiled threat that what was at stake was “maintaining good rela-
O
N tions between INALCO and China.” “They also came twice […] they are less sub-
S tle orally,” explained Françoise Robin, an INALCO professor.653 All in vain, because 

INALCO did not cede – contrary to Sciences Po, who had planned to host him as 
well but “cancelled his visit after an intervention of  the Embassy of  China.”654 At the 
INALCO event, its president, Manuelle Frank, was even “on stage during the whole 
conference, even though the embassy had urged her no to.”655 This time, there was no 
sanction. 

C These interventions are not aimed at exceptional guests like the Dalai Lama only: they 
A are commonplace in university life, including in France, as Jean-Philippe Béja, emeritus

c. The role of  Chinese diplomats
Nationalist Chinese students are not the only actors involved: Chinese diplomats often 

give them a hand. In the United States for instance, diplomats have notably “infringed on C
the academic freedom of  American university faculty, students, administrators, and O

N
staff by complaining to universities about invited speakers and events; pressuring and/or C
offering inducements to faculty whose work involves content deemed sensitive by the PRC E
authorities.” They have also “infringed on the personal safety of  people at American P
universities by probing faculty and staff  for information in a manner consistent with intel- T

S
ligence collection; and employing intimidating modes of  conversation.”657 

When they do not intervene directly, diplomats at least collect data. In Japan, for instance, 
where there are only 115,000 Chinese students, who are also less active than in the pre-
viously mentioned countries, the embassy keeps a file on students, asking incoming 
Chinese students to register to send them messages. It also gives instructions: some of  A
these students received an order to befriend Taiwanese students, to seduce them, to invite C
them to China, to help them find a job, etc.658 T

O
In all cases, it ultimately questions the link between students and Chinese authorities. R

It is certain that “Chinese students are becoming even more assertive and aggres- S
sive, taking advantage of  the freedom of  their host countries, and operating with 
increasingly open support from the Chinese authorities,” as explained by Rowena He, 
professor at St Michael’s College in Vermont.659 And yet, what does this support entail? 
When they surveil, inform, intimidate, and protest, do students simply express their patri-
otism spontaneously or are they more or less guided by the authorities, via the embassies A
and consulates? This is a crucial question insofar as, in the former case, the host country’s C
universities and authorities cannot do much besides stressing and enforcing limits inherent T
to the freedom of  expression (which does not cover harassment, hate speech, death threats I

O
and physical aggressions) while, in the latter case, it involves a blatant interference. N

However, the fact that a counter-demonstration is not aligned with the values of  the S
host country, and provokes the indignation of  the universities and authorities, does not 
mean that it is necessarily organized by China’s agents. In fact, it is hard to tell whether 
the actions of  Chinese students are, in general, spontaneous or guided, first of  all 
because “in general” does not apply here – all cases are specific; second, because most of  
the Chinese students have internalized the constraint even before they arrived in the 
country where they study. As Dirk Van der Kley explained: “there is enough patriotism and C
pride among Chinese students that these kinds of  things are going to happen frequently, A
even without [the Chinese] government direction.”660 “They are even more indoctrinated S

E
than before,” added an interlocutor in Stockholm, “the embassies and consulates do not 
even need to control them, they’re programmed.”661 In many cases, however, it is pos-

3. Student Associations (CSSA)

In most universities in the world with a notable share of  Chinese students, there is a local 
C
O branch of  the Chinese Student and Scholars Association (CSSA, 中国学生学者联合
N 会). For instance, there are 265 CSSAs in American universities for about 300,000 Chinese 
C students.662 Under a façade of  solidarity and kindness (they help the arriving Chinese stu-
E
P dents to adapt to their new environment, to find housing, roommates, etc.), the CSSAs 
T are in fact preferred platforms for United Front activities.663 They not only serve to 
S maintain a certain control over Chinese students abroad, but also to mobilize them if  

necessary to defend China against critical opinions. 
The bubble created by CSSAs around Chinese students, under the guise of  helping 

them, actually monitors and controls what they say, which is problematic for those who 
go abroad precisely to benefit from the freedom they do not have in China. They are so 

A supported that “they feel they are being hosted by the Chinese government in Australia,”664 
C
T and parents who send their children to study in Australia also to allow them to make friends 
O abroad “are disappointed when they come back saying they only hang out with fellow 
R Chinese students.”665

S CSSAs organize campus surveillance, the denunciation of  opponents or critics, 
the promotion of  Beijing’s interests, the organization of  demonstrations and count-
er-demonstrations; they also censor professors and conferences – or encourage self-censor-
ship. In 2017, the president of  the CSSA at the University of  Canberra, Lu Lupin, admitted 
that she “would inform the embassy if  dissident Chinese students were organizing a human 

A rights protest.”666 
C They serve, in particular, as intermediaries for the authorities when they need to mobi-
T
I lize thousands or even tens of  thousands of  students for events, such as welcom-
O ing Chinese political leaders visiting the country, or to counter dissident protests. 
N This phenomenon is not new. In 2008, 20,000 Chinese students in Australia had been 
S mobilized via the CSSA to welcome the Olympic Torch in Canberra – and, in passing, 

they “intimidated and punched protesters supporting Tibetan independence.”667 Similarly, 
Xi Jinping’s welcome party in Washington in September 2015, with hundreds of  Chinese 
students aligned in the street and waving flags, was not spontaneous: the embassy went 
through CSSAs to recruit 700 students, paid $20 each (remuneration distributed by CSSAs 
a few months later) and, during the event, diplomats were in direct contact with them via

WeChat, “responding to messages as late as 3 a.m.”668 As reminded by Bethany Allen- D
U

Ebrahimian, this is far from being the only example of  paid student mobilizations orches- C

trated via CSSAs. In the U.S. (there are other examples elsewhere), it happened for Xi’s visit T
I

in February 2012, when he was vice-president (the embassy transfered the funds promised O
N

to George Washington University’s CSSA only one year later), and in Chicago for the visit 
of  Hu Jintao in 2011.669 The Chinese Embassy in Australia also “trained hundreds of  CSSA 
members,” and “divided [them] into ‘security squads’” during the visit of  Prime Minister C
Li Keqiang in March 2017.670 O

Students are encouraged to commit to the CSSAs in order to please Chinese diplomats N
at the embassy and/or consulates and obtain scholarships, recommendation letters, fund- C

E
ing for extracurricular activities, and invitations to events.671 There are many testimonies P
of  students undergoing pressure from a CSSA to dissuade them from doing this, or on T
the contrary, encourage them to do that. The permanent surveillance exerted by the S
CSSAs on other students is meant to be dissuasive: its impact is translated less in terms 
of  sanctions impacting a few individuals but rather, in practice, by the fact that all Chinese 
students are careful about what they say in public, explained Perry Link, professor at the 
University of  California – Riverside.672 

This is an “essential element of  the propaganda and a guarantee of  Chinese patriotism A
C

abroad.”673 According to Chen Yonglin, a Chinese diplomat who defected in Australia in T
2005, CSSAs “are in fact controlled by the Chinese mission and are an extension O
of  the Chinese communist regime overseas.”674 The general association is financed in R

S
part by the Chinese government,675 and “these organizations live in great part thanks to the 
subsidies from the PRC delegations abroad.”676 Many CSSAs admit on their websites being 
“registered with, or even subsidized by the local Chinese Embassy or consulate.”677 Cornell 
University’s CSSA, for instance, noted on its website that it is “the ONLY Chinese student 
organization officially supported by Embassy of  People’s Republic of  China at Cornell 
University.”678 This financial relation is more or less assumed: some CSSAs do not hide A
it, others visibly regret having spoken about it (see picture below). Perhaps for discretion’s C

T
sake, the money provided by the Chinese authorities is sometimes wired not to the official I
CSSA account, but to the treasurer’s personal account or to another undeclared account: O
hence, the university’s administration does not know that a student organization N

S
on its campus receives funds from a foreign government, which, in the United States 
for instance, enables them to go below the radar of  the Foreign Agents Registration Act 
(FARA).679

“Most of  CSSA operate under the guidance of  Chinese embassies and consulates”680; in 
fact, the People’s Daily wrote in 2013 that CSSAs in Australia “accomplish their mission […] 
under the direct guidance of  the Embassy’s Education Office.”681 The point of  con-

A tact for the students is usually the person in charge of  education at the consulate,682 given 
C that the Ministry for Education has many links with the United Front Work Department 
T
O (UFWD) – as illustrated by the appointment of  an UFWD executive as attaché for edu-
R cation in Chicago between 2013 and 2016.683 The same is true for CSSAs in the United 
S Kingdom, Holland, Egypt, Singapore, but also in France.684 Korea University’s CSSA even 

admitted on its website that the eighth bureau of  the UFWD was responsible for the “gen-
eral orientation of  the student organizations abroad.”685 Other clues also point to links 
between CSSAs and the United Front. Several CSSAs participated in a conference in 
2015 to “study the spirit of  the United Front’s work,” including CSSAs from Yale, Kyoto, 

A Princeton, Rome, universities in California, Moscow and in France.686 Furthermore, CSSAs 
C in the United Kingdom received a delegation from the Ministry of  Education led by the 
T
I UFWD and which counted, amongst its members, the vice-director of  the 6th UFWD 
O Bureau Duan Xiuyun (段秀云), who was also the vice-secretary of  the China Overseas 
N Friendship Association (中华海外联谊会).687

Some nonetheless believe that “intelligence officers in diplomatic facilities are the pri- D
U

mary point of  contact for students in CSSAs”688 and that the MSS takes that opportunity C

to recruit informants, if  not agents, among the students.689 Some meetings are official T
I

(each year, the Chinese Embassy in Australia invites all CSSA leaders in Australian univer- O
N

sities to meetings at the embassy).690 Others, however, are clandestine: Frank Tian Xie, 
professor at the University of  South Carolina, was part of  the CSSA when he arrived as a 
student at Purdue University in the 1980s, and he remembered that, at the time, represen- C
tatives of  the Chinese consulate in Chicago met with CSSA students in motel rooms.691 For O
Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuya, “the embassies’ education services are N
directly linked to Chinese secret services.”692 In fact, there are multiple evidence that some C

E
CSSAs have worked with or for the MSS.693 The FBI presumably documented encoun- P
ters between intelligence officers and students. As early as 2005, Le Monde revealed that the T
CSSA of  the Catholic University of  Leuven (KUL) was involved in “a multinational net- S
work of  economic intelligence overseen from Belgium.”694 

Generally speaking, “CSSAs often attempt to conceal or obscure their ties to the 
Chinese government, frequently omitting incriminating language from the English ver-
sions of  their websites – the ones typically reviewed by university administrators.”695 The 
Chinese versions are often more revealing, sometimes oversharing: in 2017 for instance, the A

C
president of  George Washington University’s CSSA explained in a promotional video that T
the CSSA was “directed by the Chinese Embassy” and that it “[worked] with” the embas- O
sy.696 The CSSA at the Australian National University presented itself  as “the only Chinese R

S
student organization in Canberra officially approved by the Chinese government.”697 
Chinese authorities have also expressed their gratitude, as shown by this “appreciation cer-
tificate” delivered by the consulate to a CSSA president (see below). In addition, executive 
members of  Swiss CSSAs are often hired by organizations dealing with Chinese influence 
in the country, once their studies completed, which made Ralph Weber say that the “CSSA 
could also have an important role in talent recruitment.”698 A

R A feeling of  impunity and omnipotence on foreign campuses
S

The Australian scholar Clive Hamilton reported that, during the summer of  2019, on the 
campus of  Brisbane University in Queensland, a security guard caught three men trashing 
a “Lennon wall” put together to support Hong Kong protests. “The men refused to show 
student IDs [and] when the guard indicated he would call the police, the leader of  the group 
replied: “I do not care if  you call the police. I will call the Ambassador.”699 This reminded him 
of  another story: four years earlier, the president of  the Australian National University’s CSSA 

A in Canberra asked who had “authorized” the campus pharmacy to sell the Epoch Times, journal 
C of  Falun Gong, and intimidated the pharmacist until he threw them away. These examples 
T – and there are many more – attest of  a feeling of  omnipotence from some Chinese stu-
I dents on foreign campuses, aware of  their economic weight and, thus, of  the schools’ 
O dependence on them; they are also certain of  the support, and encouragements, of  
N Chinese authorities.

4. Shaping China studies

C Academic communities working on China are generally divided. To only con-
A sider the German example, the community is mostly empathetic vis-à-vis Beijing, and the 
S few dissident voices are more often than not on the sidelines of  China studies depart-
E ments. The micro-community of  researchers working on and in Taiwan set itself  apart 

from traditional German universities. In fact, a majority of  researchers, shaped by inter-
personal relationships they have built with their Chinese academic partners for decades, 
are closer to the discourse of  the business class: China is not a threat, and the point is 

C to try and deconstruct the prejudices and the ignorance vis-à-vis this original political 
O system. They hope to work on a rapprochement and dialogue (notably through academic

exchange programs). The researchers considering China as a threat or those qualified as D
U

“China-Kritiker” are in the minority in Germany, and most do not have permanent posi- C

tions in German universities. The open letter published by the spouse of  the Canadian T
I

researcher Michael Kovrig, arrested and detained in China (→ p. 546), was signed by O
N

MERICS experts, journalists, think tankers critical of  China at the Deutsche Gesellschaft 
für Auswärtige Politik (DGAP), but not by the crushing majority of  university professors 
in Germany (about forty scholars). It revealed the invisible fracture between the “China- C
Versteher” and “China-Kritiker.”700 O

Tensions inside the academic community and think tanks working on China are pres- N
ent everywhere in the world and efficiently exploited by Beijing. Besides, to control the C

E
research published on China, and thus to model China studies, the Party-State P
uses the following tools: T

• Access to the field, using visas as leverage: they deny visas to researchers who are S

too critical, either on a case by case basis or, as it increasingly does, as part of  offi-
cial sanctions, such as those enacted in March 2021. Indeed, they targeted the British 
researcher Joanne Smith Finley, Assistant Professor of  China studies at the University of  
Newcastle; the Swedish Björn Jerdén, director of  the Swedish National China Center at A
the Swedish Institute of  International Affairs in Stockholm: the German Adrian Zenz, C
Senior Fellow in China Studies at the Victims of  Communism Memorial Foundation T
in the United States; and the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), the larg- O

R
est European research foundation on China, based in Berlin, and which hosts more S
than thirty experts. These individuals “and companies and institutions associated with 
them,” but also their families, are barred from visiting China, Hong Kong, and Macao, 
and they can no longer do business in China. Beijing accused them of  circulating “lies” 
about China, on the fate of  the Uyghurs but also, in the case of  Jerdén, on the danger 
represented by the Confucius Institutes, or, in the case of  MERICS experts, for “col-
luding with anti-China forces.” Targeting MERICS was surprising because it was far A

C
from the most radical research center on China; it usually followed a more moderate T
line. And yet, it was “the largest Chinese research center in entire Europe. Cutting off  I
ties with China means its research channel will hardly be sustainable and its influence O

N
will be critically hit,” the Global Times noted. The goal was clearly to dry up the S
sources and the credibility of  these individuals and institutions (first and fore-
most based on the researchers’ access to the field, in area studies), while intimidating 
the other researchers on China elsewhere in the world. Like this young sinologist 
who, under cover of  anonymity precisely because he fears losing access to his research 
field, reports: “We all hear about a blacklist of  researchers who would no longer be 
issued visas”. It does not matter whether this is true or not – it is even in Beijing’s C
interest to maintain a strategic ambiguity since, when in doubt, not knowing A
what their situation is and what the Chinese authorities’ tolerance threshold is, S
visa applicants will censor themselves with greater zeal. The anonymous young E

sinologist worries: “If  tomorrow I can no longer go in the field, what legitimacy would 
I have as a researcher?” And, to show his credentials, he makes sure to include at least 
one official propaganda document in his bibliography – “a way to show the plurality

D of  entries and not to antagonize anyone,” he justifies.701 This is how self-censorship 
U
C begins and how the CCP wins.
T
I • Financial dependence (universities financially dependent on China are less suscepti-
O
N ble to criticize it → p. 270);

• Elite capture (gifting luxurious trips and jobs – supplementary or full-time positions 
– in Chinese universities); 

C
O • Pressure by Chinese students on campuses (shaping the topics studied and the list 
N of  guest lecturers);
C
E • Pressure on publishers (to discourage them from publishing critical books such as 
P Silent Invasion by Clive Hamilton, which was rejected by several publishers by fear of  
T
S “retaliation from Beijing or from people in Australia acting in the name of  the CCP”),702 

and on scientific journals (→ p. 287);
• Pressure on PhD advisors (a professor at the University of  St. Gallen in Switzerland 
received emails “from China” stating that one of  her PhD students was posting “neo-
Nazi type content” on Twitter (in reality, his account created ten days earlier and fol-

A lowed by less than ten people was only criticizing China’s handling of  the Covid-19 
C
T pandemic); fearing “that [she] would not be able to get a visa to China afterwards,” 
O she sent her PhD student an email titled, “Urgent: Complaint from China about your 
R Twitter” and terminated the academic relationship; the student has since dropped out of  
S the PhD program)703; 

• Pressure on relatives in China for Chinese researchers of  Chinese origin or with 
ties to China. For example, a professor of  Chinese origin, naturalized French, working 
in a French university, posted this message on a social network in May 2021: “It is too 
dangerous for me to comment on the Xinjiang issue. Although I have always fought for 

A
C academic freedom and freedom of  expression, I must do my best to protect the safety 
T of  my family on the Chinese mainland”).704 For similar reasons, some professors, such 
I as Vanessa Frangville (a professor of  China studies at the Université Libre de Bruxelles), 
O have given up on taking Chinese doctoral students because “either they are there for 
N
S other reasons than studying, or I am putting them in danger.”705

• Arrests and intimidations for those with access to their field in China. In 2017, 
Feng Chongyi, a permanent resident in Australia who holds a professorship at the 
University of  Technology, Sydney, was completing a three-week research field trip to 
southern China, during which he had met with human rights defenders, among others, 
when he was detained by the authorities, questioned, and held for one week. Another 

C example: a doctoral student from a Belgian university “was detained” during a trip in 
A
S China “and interrogated for three days in a hotel room. The Chinese services had a huge 
E file on him, including all his tweets since 2016 translated into Mandarin and a photo of  

a dinner at his [thesis director’s] home”.706

Influencing publishers, printers and booksellers E
P

In August 2017, the British publisher Cambridge University Press (CUP) blocked ac- T
cess to over 300 online articles from China Quarterly to residents of  Chinaat the request S
of  the Chinese authorities because they covered topics considered sensitive by Beijing, 
including the cultural revolution, Tian’anmen, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan.707 The General 
Administration of  Press and Publications (→ p. 193) made the request, providing the list of  all 
the articles to remove. CUP yielded to be able to continue publishing in China: “[we] do not, 
and will not, proactively censor our content and will only consider blocking individual items 
(when requested to do so) when the wider availability of  content is at risk.”708 In other words, 
publishers yield to what they perceived as the lesser of  two evils, because Beijing gave A
them the choice between removing the contentious articles or blocking their overall C
distribution. Following the scandal that this case brought about, (academics rallied against T
the decision), CUP went back on its decision, and a few days later, reestablished access to the O
articles in question. The Chinese authorities then asked CUP to block certain articles from the R
American Political Science Review which they did not do.709 S
This example is not isolated. In November 2017, the German publisher Springer Nature 
blocked access from China to at least 1,000 articles, at the request of  the Chinese govern-
ment.710 In September 2018, at Beijing’s request, the British publisher Taylor and Francis 
removed from its offer in China (its pack “arts, humanities and social sciences” sold to 
libraries) 83 journals with content deemed “inappropriate,” including the Asian Studies Review. 
More recently, in France, a Chinese university asked the portal Cairn, which distributes online A
journals, to withdraw the December 2020 issue of  the journal Esprit, containing a dossier on C
China, which Cairn refused to do.711

T
Even children’s publishing is targeted. In March 2021, at the request of  the Chinese con- I
sulate in Hamburg, which threatened legal action, the German publisher Carlsen-Verlag with- O
drew from sale an illustrated children’s book (Ein Corona-Regenbogen für Anna und Moritz) that N
had become the target of  Chinese authorities and media (citing a request from the “Chinese S
community” in Germany712) because it described the coronavirus as “originating in China”. 
The publisher is preparing a new, corrected edition.713

Book publications are also concerned, which are often far less expensive in China (45% 
less expensive than in New Zealand for a book in color with illustrations on glassy paper for 
instance),714 which gives Beijing yet more leverage: some Chinese printers take it upon 
themselves to censor, sometimes reject, foreign books meant for foreign publics. For 
instance, one of  them produced a list of  keywords that publishers needed to avoid, while an

T Finally, what the above demonstration shows is that Beijing’s objective is to influence 
I writings at every stage: not only their production (by trying to influence authors through 
O
N incentives and pressures, pushing them to censor themselves for instance) but also their 

distribution, by trying to influence publishers and printers. It also includes the last stage 
which, for books, is their sales in bookstores. Here the story of  the Thalia bookstore chain 
in Germany is telling. In September 2020, a customer posted photos on Facebook of  the 

C particularly large and propagandistic China section of  a Thalia bookstore in Berlin, high-
O lighting in particular the works of  President Xi Jinping and significantly lacking in publica-
N tions critical of  the Party. It thus drew attention to a practice that was not new (a year ear-
C lier, a Taiwanese from Berlin had also reported it on Facebook, but in Chinese, so without 
E causing a German reaction in the media). This time, Thalia had to react and explain itself  by 
P acknowledging that it had rented some space in some of  its stores to China Book Trading, 
T a German subsidiary of  the China International Publishing Group (CIPG), an organization 
S dependent on the Party’s Propaganda Department.716 These rental contracts are neither il-

legal nor unusual, but in this case, the nature of  the client introduced an important bias in 
the presentation of  books from and about a country.717 The German press denounced such 
“propaganda” in the country’s bookstores. “Chinese propaganda is much more effective 
in Germany when it is distilled by people, media or even reputable companies like Thalia,” 
explains researcher Mareike Ohlberg.718

fiscated equipment, including computers – these issues happen everywhere in China, but 
even more so when a researcher goes to sensitive regions such as Xinjian and Tibet).721 For 
70% of  the respondents “self-censorship is a problem in the China study field.”722

C
Another article based on over a hundred interviews in American universities spoke of  O

“an epidemic of  self-censorship at U.S. universities on the subject of  China.”723 N
Considering the lack of  resources in most universities, many students are tempted to reori- C

E
ent their research in a direction that satisfies Beijing in order to have access to the field and P
receive funding. “It has gotten to the point where I do not engage with anything overly T
political relating to the Chinese state,” explained, for instance, a graduate student at a top S
American university.724 A common, and even encouraged, reaction: “I frequently hear grad-
uate students and younger scholars – people with academic jobs but pre-tenure – being 
advised not to explore sensitive subjects in their research, so they can preserve visa access,” 
an American historian on China testified.725 But this self-censorship has consequences: it 
“restricts the ability of  U.S. policymakers, businesspeople, human rights advocates, and the A

C
general public to make smart decisions about how to interact with China.”726 T

Self-censorship is made stronger by blurry red lines: Beijing has not created a guide O
explaining what to say or what not to say, it is up to everyone’s best guess. This ambiguity is R

S
strategic: it prompts even more self-censorship to avoid the risk of  crossing limits that are 
not clearly defined. 

That being said, the more China extends its influence over the world, the more it 
becomes possible to study China outside of  China: researchers who no longer go to 
mainland China do a lot of  field research in Honk Kong (less since 2019), in Taiwan, in 
Korea, Mongolia, etc. And the more Beijing becomes aggressive toward foreign research- A
ers, increasing the risks for them to run into issues in China, if  not being arrested, accused C

T
of  espionage, etc., the more acceptable it becomes for scholars to do field research outside I
of  China. Not only is it increasingly difficult to learn anything in China (due to self-cen- O
sorship and wooden language), but it makes sense for personal security reasons. Moreover, N

S
with the conditions that Beijing requires to grant access to its territory, i.e. no criticism of  
the Party, it becomes more legitimate not to go there anymore, if  only not to give up 
one’s ability to be critical, and in fine to ensure that the research is independent. Hence this 
“internationally renowned researcher” quoted by the newspaper Libération who “explains 
that she has renounced doing field research [in China], precisely to preserve this freedom 
of  speech”727. This is obviously easier to do for researchers who are already well known, or C
in any case who are not in a precarious professional situation, than for young researchers A
who are more fragile and insecure. S

D 5. Acquiring knowledge and technologies 
U
C
T Another major CCP interest for foreign universities comes from the acquisition 
I
O of  knowledge and technologies, through legal and unconcealed means: joint 
N research programs (leading to joint publications, the number of  which continues to 

grow, as shown by the British example with less than 100 articles co-published before 
1990, 750 in 2000, 3,324 in 2010 and 16,267 in 2019728) or illegal and concealed means 

C
O such as theft and espionage by Chinese students or researchers integrated in foreign 
N teams, or from a distance (cyberattacks). Joint research programs, and more generally 
C research field trips in China are all the more tempting for researchers and visiting profes-
E
P sors because Chinese universities – or at least some of  them – have significant resources 
T and state-of-the-art equipment that most home institutions do not have. This is true of  
S France, where “the lack of  recognition and means in the laboratories” was quickly 

identified by Beijing as an “Achilles heel”, i.e. an opportunity. The Party has had 
no trouble catching the attention and skills of  French students and scientists for whom, 
as Antoine Bondaz explains, China is “a paradise: brand new labs, significant financial 
resources and a plethora of  research support teams.”729 The attraction is less strong in the 

A best-endowed French laboratories, which is why “Beijing seeks to establish itself  in 
C
T priority in medium-sized universities, far from the metropolises. This is where the 
O lack of  resources – and therefore the real or potential bitterness of  teachers – is 
R more acute. Poitiers, Angers, Arras, Pau. These are the same faculties where Confucius 
S institutes are often found.” (→ p. 299)730

Concerning theft and espionage, universities are not the only targets. Companies 
in strategic sectors are also targeted, with the same tactics and more, including the 
seduction of  executives by female agents, going as far as marriage. “Weddings are another 
one of  the means used by Beijing to catch up on its technological gap in some sectors. In 

A 2009, the DGSE brought the proof  that a young Chinese woman, in a relationship with 
C one of  the leaders of  the EADS group with secret defense accreditation, was transmitting 
T
I confidential documents to her country’s secret services.”731

O
N a. Many recruiting programs 
S

In this context, China developed numerous talents recruitment programs which, for 
the CCP, is a “form of  technology transfer.”732 Alex Joske, in his report Hunting the Phoenix 
(2020) – “phoenix”, because this practice is sometimes described in China as “building 
nests to attract phoenixes”733 – counted about 200 of  them, according to a list published 
in 2018 by the State Administration of  Foreign Experts Affairs (which is now part of  the 

C Ministry of  Science and Technology), while noting that the real number was “probably 
A much greater.”734 This practice was developed during the 1980s, with a clear acceleration in 
S the 2000s. Most of  these programs are controlled by local governments, in the provinces,

municipalities and counties735 – but they are coordinated by several central organizations, D
U

including, since 2003, the Central Coordination Group for Talent Work (中央人才工作 C
T

协调小组). According to official Chinese numbers, the sole programs run by the local I
governments enabled the recruitment of  53,900 foreign researchers between 2008 O

N
and 2016, to which are added the national programs, including the Thousand Talents Plan 
(→ p. 292) and Hundred Talents Plan, which brought 7,000 researchers during the same 
period.736 C

These programs cover all activities, from legal and unconcealed actions to ille- O
gal and concealed ones, and the grey area in between. Concretely, they are based on N
“talent-recruitment stations” abroad, in the countries currently the most technologically C

E
advanced. The United States is the priority target, with 146 identified stations, then comes P
Germany (57), Australia (57), the United Kingdom (49), Canada (47), France (46), Australia T
(46), Singapore (21), New-Zealand (13), and Sweden (12).737 Overall, Alex Joske identified S
600 stations, and believed there were likely more than that. They have existed since 2006, 
and have increased exponentially after 2015.

Composed of  a few individuals, these stations are more often than not inte-
grated in existing organizations linked to the UFWD (business offices for Chinese 
abroad, or other community, student, or professional organizations, companies in the A

C
education or technology sectors, or, in at least one case, to a Confucius Institute, etc.), T
which is paid extra for this activity: up to RMB150,000 (€18,700) per year for the O
running costs and up to RMB200,000 (€25,000) per recruited individual, according to R

S
Alex Joske.738

manager.” The objective was 100 individuals and “at least as many innovation projects” 

C for those of  the city of  Tianjin. This data is then compiled and amounts to millions of  
O profiles: in 2017, a Chinese think tank had established a base of  6.5 million scientific 
N profiles in the world. The Thousand Talents think tank (千人智库), tied to the plan of  
C
E the same name, “claims to hold data on 12 million overseas scientists, including 2.2 
P million ethnic Chinese scientists and engineers.”740 These stations do not only relay infor-
T mation, they may also “receive instructions to target individuals with access to specific 
S technologies.”741

The most famous program is the Thousand Talents (千人计划), which “has poured 
billions of  dollars into drawing in tens of  thousands of  foreign specialists to China and 
sends out thousands of  Chinese scientists overseas to access the latest technology and 
knowhow.”742 Created in 2008, its implementation is supervised by the High-Level Working 

A
C Group on Overseas Talent Recruitment (海外高层次人才引进工作小组) which depends 
T on the Central Committee of  the CCP. Initially conceived to attract Chinese talents living 
O abroad, it was extended to foreign citizens in 2011. Beijing offers prestigious positions in 
R Chinese universities and high salaries. An advertisement placed in the scientific journal 
S Nature in January 2018 thus explained that “all successful applicants can expect a 1 million 

yuan [126 000 €] starting bonus, and the opportunity to apply for a research fund of  3–5 
million yuan [378 000 – 630 000 €]. Foreign scientists receive additional incentives, such as 
accommodation subsidies, meal allowances, relocation compensation, paid-for visits home 
and subsidized education costs. Employers are also obliged to find jobs for foreign spouses, 

A or provide an equivalent local salary.”743
C
T That being said, living in China is not necessary – on the contrary, it can be quite 
I advantageous for both parties not to relocate and leave scientists in their home country. 
O A short-term version of  the Thousand Talents Plan exists, allowing the recipients to stay 
N
S abroad and only spend two months in China each year, which “enables them to maintain 

multiple appointments at once, which may not be fully disclosed. This may mean that 
they’re effectively using time, resources and facilities paid for by their home institutions to 
benefit Chinese institutions.”744 

Alex Joske mentioned the case of  Prof. Steven X. Ding (丁先春) from the University of  
Duisburg (Germany), who received an affiliation to Tianjin University (China). It showed 

C the advantage for China to have him abroad: “I manage scientific research at the university, 
A which has more than 100 projects supervised by me […]. I can serve as a bridge between 
S China and Germany for technological exchange … and I can make greater contributions 
E than if  I returned to China on my own. Being in Germany I can introduce advanced tech-

nologies to China, assist communication, exchange and cooperation, and play a role as a D
U

window and a bridge [between China and Germany].”745 C

Many targets are of  Chinese origin (the Party can present these programs “as serving T
I

the country’s ethno-nationalist rejuvenation”).746 One of  the most recent example is Gong O
N

Chen, born in China, naturalized American, and a mechanical engineering professor at the 
prestigious Massachusetts Institute of  Technology (MIT). He was arrested in January 2021 
for failing to disclose “that he was acting as an overseas expert on science and technol- C
ogy for the Chinese communist government after China’s consulate office in New York O
asked him to provide expertise and advice in exchange for financial compensation and N
awards.” He allegedly received $29 million in foreign funding, mainly from China, and at C

E
least $355,000 for his “services and expertise.”747 P

However, the targets are not always of  Chinese descent, as attested by the case of  T
Charles Lieber, chair of  the Department of  Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard S
University, who was arrested in 2020 because he hid the fact that he combined his position 
at Harvard with a job as a “Strategic Scientist” at the Wuhan University of  Technology 
between 2012 and 2017, as part of  the Thousand Talents, and that he received a monthly 
salary of  $50,000 from China, with an additional grant reaching RMB1 million and a fund-
ing of  RMB1.5 million (€190,000) to create a joint lab between Harvard and Wuhan.748 A

C
Among the other programs, there is Project 111, which is meant to recruit 1,000 research- T

ers from the 100 best universities in the world; the Peacock Program (孔雀计划) of  O
the Shenzhen government “which seeks to attract global talent ranging from Nobel Prize R

S
winners and winners of  other major academic prizes, senior executives of  the world’s top 
500 companies or of  international financial organizations, members of  the International 
Standardization Organization (ISO) Standards Committee, university presidents, heads of  
academic associations such as the Royal Society, foreign experts who have won a Friendship 
Award, editors of  leading scientific journals, actuaries, medical specialists, and Olympic 
coaches.”749 The PLA also used Horizon 2020, the 2014-2020 European program for A
research and development, in order to “gain access to international military technology.”750 C

T
On a different note, the “Gray Temples” program “aims to pamper very young retir- I

ees or executives at the end of  their careers to benefit from their knowledge. ‘This mainly O
concerns researchers or engineers,’ noted a French scholar. ‘The Chinese invite them to N

S
seminars, pay the plane fare and the hotel expenses, it’s nice. And, if  it goes well, they can 
be offered funding for their research.’”751

b. Programs that raise a lot of  issues 
These programs bring about many issues. First, the copyrights of  all research produced, 

even those co-financed or financed by programs in other countries, have to be registered C
in China.752 Furthermore, these programs often serve as a cover and channel for eco- A
nomic espionage, fraud, and theft pure and simple. In the annex of  his report, Alex S

U
C arrested and convicted for one of  these reasons.753 
T
I Finally, among the Chinese universities involved, those linked to the defense and security 
O
N sectors are over-represented: recruited researchers in fact develop Chinese military 

capabilities. The modernization of  the PLA owes a lot to “an international technology 
transfer strategy, which includes academic exchanges, investment in foreign companies, 

C espionage, and hacking.”754

O For instance, one of  the recruiting stations in Australia is located within the Northwestern 
N Polytechnic University Alumni Association (西北工业大学, NPU), which has developed 
C
E numerous links with Australian universities, and famously bragged about having presented 
P no less than five professors from Melbourne at the NPU in less than a month. However, the 
T NPU is one of  the main universities in the defense sector in China, specialized in aviation, 
S space, and naval technology; it is one of  the China’s “Seven Sons of  National Defense” 

(国防七子), which regroup the seven most important universities in the defense sector.755 
Over 41% of  its graduates are employed in that sector.756 Another example: in 2014, the 
Chinese Academy of  Engineering and Physics (中国工程物理研究院, CAEP), which is 
the main school for research on nuclear weapons, had already recruited no less than 57 

A
C researchers through the Thousand Talents programs.757 The number of  scientists from 
T the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory that have been recruited by Chinese insti-
O tutions is so important that “they’re reportedly known as the ‘Los Alamos Club.’”758

R Some assume that tie, such as this “Australian participant in the Thousand Talents pro-
S gram speaking of  his duty to contribute to the development of  China’s national defense,”759 

while others would rather ignore or hide it, which is, in and of  itself, another problem. 
Often, recruited individuals fail to disclose it. An investigation at A&M University in 
Texas found more than 100 staff  members “linked to China’s talent programs, but only five 
disclosed it despite employees being required to do so.”760 The Thousand Talents Plan how-

A ever, allows its recipients to be considered as entrepreneurs with one or more companies in 
C
T China that are supported by the Thousand Talents Plan Venture Capital Center (千人计划
I 创投中心). It is through such a ploy that a start-up born in an Australian university lab 
O and financed by it provided the Chinese government with the surveillance technol-
N
S ogy used against Uyghurs, unbeknownst to the university (see box).

When Australia indirectly contributes to the repression of  Uyghurs T
I

Heng Tao Shen, a talented computer scientist appointed professor at the University of  O
Queensland in 2011 at 34, was recruited three years later by a Chinese university (University N

of  Electronic Science and Technology of  China (UESTC)) as part of  the Thousand Talents 
program. He then founded a start-up in artificial intelligence, Koala AI, while maintaining 
his links to UQ, where he stayed as honorary professor. He used these links to poach sev- C
eral Australians for Koala AI, including researchers at UNSW, UQ, and at the University of  O
Melbourne. Koala AI expanded considerably and was worth more than a billion dollars in N
2020. Among its activities, the company provided the Chinese government with a surveillance C
system installed at the border with Kazakhstan, through which many Uyghurs fled the Chinese E
repression, to detect and categorize potentially suspect individuals and vehicles. Koala AI also P
managed a joint lab with the Chinese Ministry of  Public Security. This sparked a scandal in T
Australia because Heng Tao Shen benefited, when he was a researcher there, from public fund- S
ing (AUS$2.6 million from the Australian Research Council), of  which more than half  (1.6 
million) was used after he founded Koala AI, to finance research on surveillance technology 
that are now used in Xinjiang.761

A
The civil-military fusion, i.e. the policy aiming to develop links between the civil- C

ian and military sectors to help China’s economic and military growth, was devel- T
O

oped by Hu Jintao in 2007 and Xi Jinping made it a national strategy; he personally heads R
the Central Committee for the Development of  Military – Civil Fusion (中央军民融合 S
发展委员会).762 Concretely, it means that many Chinese civilian universities contribute to 
military research, if  not to some activities: “[at] least 15 civilian universities have been 
implicated in cyberattacks, illegal exports or espionage.”763

The situation for the many foreign universities sharing sometimes tight links with Chinese 
institutions is problematic insofar as, through research projects or joint articles, exchanges A
between researchers, they may indirectly contribute to the development of  the PLA C
and to the elaboration of  surveillance, control, and oppression technologies used T
against the Chinese population. Several scandals have burst in recent years, such as I

O
when Australia was accused of  indirectly contributing to repression of  Uyghurs (see box). N
Furthermore, in February 2021, The Times revealed that close to 200 British researchers S
working in a dozen British universities were suspected to be involuntarily helping Beijing 
build weapons of  mass destruction by transferring sensitive military technologies.764 
Considering the extent of  collaborations with China, and the Chinese civil-military inter-
weaving, this type of  scandals will presumably be on the rise in the next few years.

Alex Joske (ASPI) was key in drawing attention to this risk with his famous report Picking 
Flowers, Making Honey (2018),765 followed by The China Defense Universities Tracker (2019) C
and Hunting the Phoenix (2020).766 In January 2021, Joske also submitted a report on CCP A

O
D efforts in terms of  talent recruitment in Australia to the Parliamentary Joint Committee 
U
C on Intelligence and Security in which he explained that he had identified, in Australian 
T
I research institutions, including some government bodies, no less than 325 participants in 
O
N the Chinese talent recruitment programs.767 Similar research also looked at New Zealand,768 

the U.S.,769 and the Czech Republic.770

In 2019, Alex Joske created a database of  Chinese research institutions, both mil-
C itary and civilian, classified based on the risk they represent. This China Defence 
O Universities Tracker (https://unitracker.aspi.org.au/) proves very useful for foreign univer-
N sities and researchers, but also for public and private leaders, to evaluate the risk incurred 
C
E – included the reputational risk – by an association with certain Chinese institutions. Using 
P this database, Sinopsis and Czech Radio (Český rozhlas) noted that “14 out of  26 Czech pub-
T lic universities have established collaboration with [Chinese] civilian universities the ASPI 
S database assigns medium to very high risk.”771 

Likewise, a note of  the Embassy of  France in China, quoted by Le Point, noted that it was 
problematic that “French institutions signed agreements with more than a dozen Chinese 
universities tied to the military-industrial complex” while another note indicated than 
“twenty French academics had been recruited [by the Thousand Talents program] includ-

A
C ing eight that “continue to hold a permanent position in their home institution in France 
T at the same time.” The note continued by stressing that some “are susceptible to commu-
O nicate particularly sensitive information.” Hence, France seems to be growing aware of  the 
R problem. The French MEP Nathalie Loiseau, who coordinates the Special Committee on 
S Foreign Interference, defended that “we should start by imposing transparency. Omitting 

to declare [these positions] should be considered as an infraction.”772

These activities raised international concern, in particular from the American govern-
ment, Beijing has been concealing the Thousand Talents program as much as possi-
ble since September 2018. A directive signed on September 29, 2018 (see below) asked the 

A recruiters to “stop using emails, and opt for the phone and fax instead, during the recruit-
C
T ment process. Candidates have to be notified at the occasion of  an invitation to attend a 
I university conference or a forum in China. The written notifications cannot include the 
O words ‘Thousand Talents Plan.’”773 The process thus increasingly resembles the practice of  
N
S intelligence services.

c. Strategic infrastructures: the example of  the China-Belgium Technology Center (CBTC)
CBTC is “the first Chinese hi-tech science park in Europe,”776 with construction A

C
beginning in 2017. Strategically located 30 minutes from Brussels, close to several uni- T
versities, the center is built in the Louvain-la-Neuve science park, which is home to I
some 20 Chinese and European companies in the life sciences, information and high-tech O

N
industry sectors. The British pharmaceutical company GSK Vaccines is also located nearby. S

The main shareholder and project leader is United Investment Europe (UI Europe), a 
Belgian subsidiary of  the Chinese company United Investment Group from Hubei.777 
The project partners are the Catholic University of  Leuven (UCLouvain), the Walloon 
Export and Foreign Investment Agency (AWEX) and the Intercommunale du Brabant 
Wallon (InBW). The total investment for this project would amount to 200 million euros.778

According to UCLouvain, the project has received political endorsements from both C
countries. It has been validated by the highest authorities of  both states: President Xi A
Jinping and former Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo both attended the signing cere- S
mony of  the framework agreement at its launch in 2014. E

C ries and infrastructure to host European and Chinese companies; to help them enter and 
T

O
N development and job creation.” The CBTC offers services to facilitate cooperation between 

European and Chinese high-tech companies and to facilitate their entry and development 
in their respective markets (company creation, market analysis, tax studies, recruitment, 

C legal support, etc.). The three sectors on which the CBTC focuses are life sciences, infor-
O mation and communication technologies, and smart manufacturing.779

N The CBTC will also have a “privileged connection with the Leuven Innovation Network 
C
E ecosystem,” a network composed of  UCLouvain, the Leuven Technology Transfer Office 
P (LTTO), the VIVES – Leuven Technology fund, the UCLouvain incubators, the Louvain-
T la-Neuve Enterprise and Innovation Center and the Brussels Life Science Incubator, 
S Mind&Market as well as the UCLouvain science parks.780

The CBTC construction project – which includes offices, coworking spaces, conference 
centers, hotel, parking and convenience stores – is divided into three phases, at the end of  
which the center is expected to be able to accommodate about 100 companies and 800 
jobs on 120,000 square meters.781 The first phase was launched in 2017 and completed 

A
C in 2020. In September 2020 and with the help of  real estate agencies Allten and Hendrix,

B. Confucius Institutes T
S

Chinese language is one of  the main vectors of  the CCP’s strategy 
of  seduction. Not only does language gives an access to the Chinese 
culture and to Chinese people themselves, which constitutes a powerful 
motivation for the learners, but it is also used by the CCP to create a A
narrative, a mystification built around its age and its graphic peculiarities, C

T
where the act and art of  writing are intertwined. This influence strategy O
was materialized by the opening of  a constellation of  Confucius R

Institutes since 2004, tasked with promoting the Chinese language and culture. S

1. Organization

There are two categories of  Confucius Institutes: the institutes themselves, 
implanted in the universities, and the Confucius Classrooms, present mainly in institutions A
of  primary and secondary education. These institutions can obtain the support, and coor- C
dinate their actions with, the Chinese cultural centers at the embassies, but they are admin- T
istrated by the Hanban (汉办), which stands for the Office of  Chinese Language Council I

O
International (国家汉语国际推广领导小组办公室). The Hanban is not an agency per se, N
but an organization affiliated to the Ministry of  Education. The Hanban permanent com- S
mittee is however presided by Sun Chunlan (孙春兰), vice-prime minister, member of  the 
CCP’s Political Bureau and former manager of  the United Front Department. The direc-
tor of  the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (侨务办公室) is also in the committee; if  the 
OCAO was formerly attached to the State Council, it was integrated into the United Front 
Department in 2018. Hence, there is no doubt about the Party’s control over the activities 
of  Confucius Institutes. C

The implementation of  Confucius Institutes (CI) abroad is based on a tripartite agree- A
S

ment that includes the Hanban, the foreign university that hosts the institute in its E
facilities and a Chinese university that graciously provides the language teachers. The 
financial support offered by the Hanban through the ICs does not only include the learning 
material and teachers but, since 2009, it offers scholarships to allow foreigners to come 
to China to study Chinese and its culture. Between 2009 and 2020, about 50,000 students 
from 166 countries received such a scholarship.785 For example, in Kenya, it is estimated that C

R
O
D the CI in Nairobi alone awards at least 15 scholarships per year to African students to study in 
U
C China for 6 months and up to 10 years – potentially to a doctorate level. It also offers specific 
T
I language courses for Kenyan officials, including diplomats and customs officers.786

O
N The institutes are managed by a tandem formed by a Chinese and a local co-director, 

while all the other employees seem to consistently be Chinese. When a university accepts to 
welcome a CI, it receives a financial assistance of  a variable amount to launch its activi-

C ties, an annual grant amounting to $100,000 or $150,000 on average, although it could reach 
O several million dollars according to certain sources. The Hanban then recruits and trains 
N the new teachers who are appointed to the institutes solely based on the Hanban’s decision. 
C
E But, once there, they can receive instructions from the embassy or the consulate. The 
P linguistic resources (books, audio or video media) are also elaborated by the Hanban. 
T CIs have grown rapidly: the first opened in Seoul in November 2004, the first in Africa at 
S the University of  Nairobi in 2005, and the first Confucius Classroom in 2006 in a Bangkok 

high school. South Korea and Thailand remain the Asian countries with the largest numbers 
of  Confucius Institutes and Classrooms. At the end of  2009, there were 282 Institutes, and 
272 Classrooms in 88 countries,787 and the objective was to reach a thousand by 2020.788 Their 
number has stagnated globally since 2018 however (the official Hanban website mentions 

A
C 541 but this number has not changed in years even though some CIs have closed while others 
T have been created –the Hanban is likely intentionally ambiguous about the real number of  
O CIs).789 If  we go by the facts mentioned on the official website, there would be 135 CIs in Asia 
R (25%), 61 in Africa (11%) 138 in the Americas (25%), 187 in Europe (35%) and 20 in Oceania 
S (4%). The three countries with the most Confucius Institutes are the United States (75 insti-

tutes, including 65 on university campuses, and approximatively 500 Classrooms in August 
2020),790 the United Kingdom and Australia (14 Institutes and 67 Classrooms in Australia 
in July 2019).791 This massive expansion allowed the Party to multiply the number of  
Chinese learners and to extend its influence everywhere in the world. 

A In France, CIs allow Beijing to strengthen its influence in medium-sized cities, 
C
T where they are mainly located. There are 18 of  them in the country, where they “lead a 
I seemingly quiet life” as Nathalie Guibert explains, having travelled around France to study 
O these “ever so discreet Chinese relays.”792 These institutes appeal not only to univer-
N
S sities but also to local political actors who, fully aware of  the links between CIs 

and the Party, hope to be able to use them as communication channels to develop 
business relations, as a deputy mayor of  Angers acknowledges: “The CIs are considered 
by Chinese actors to have the seal of  the Party, with validated executives, which allows us 
to get things across better. We want a return other than cultural, the Institute must also 
promote business.”793 Their establishment is encouraged by the widely shared feeling 

C of  an inevitable Chinese domination. It is the discourse according to which “China is 
A moving fast, it is overtaking us in terms of  technology. It is going to become a superpower, 
S the question is how to work better with it,” as expressed in particular by the French co-di-

The Confucius Institute project in Greenland C
E

CIs allow China to increase its penetration in certain regions where it has little presence at P
the moment but identifies important current or future interests, such as in Greenland. China T
manifested a renewed interest for Greenland after the adoption of  a self-governing act in 2008 S
which gave the territory more autonomy from the Danish government, and notably, the possi-
bility to conclude deals with other countries. The Chinese presence in Greenland is first moti-
vated by the abundance of  natural resources (illustrated by investment in the mining sector for 
instance), the infrastructure market (ports, airports, hydraulic etc.),796 and scientific research: 
Beijing wishes to establish research stations dedicated, for instance, to climate change.797 That 
being said, the CCP envisions its penetration in Greenland within the scope of  its Arctic strat-
egy which, since the arrival to power of  Xi Jinping and the rise of  tensions with the United A
States, has explicitly become geopolitical and not merely economic. C
The continuing Chinese presence in Greenland necessarily goes through a more in-depth penetra- T
tion of  the indigenous society, and particularly its elite. Since 2016, it has led to a cooperation agree- O
ment between the cities of  Shanghai and Kujalleq (at the southern end of  the territory) in order to R
open a CI in 2018 on the Qaoqortoq campus. A well-conducted targeting of  the local elite, which is S
quantitatively unimportant, could allow to a rapid increase in the influence of  Beijing.798 However, 
for unknown reasons, the project of  a CI in Greenland seems to have aborted.

2. The true nature of  Confucius Institutes A
C
T

CI defenders generally present them as harmless language schools, similar to the Alliances I
françaises, the British Councils and the Goethe Institutes. However, and even if  it were the O
case, we must remember with the Tibet specialist Françoise Robin that “even with lan- N
guage courses, one can convey political ideas, such as showing maps of  China that include S

Taiwan.”799 Additionaly, and most importantly, CIs are in fact fundamentally different, start-
ing with their politicization: contrary to the aforementioned cultural diplomacy institutions, 
which are particularly careful not to have any link to a political party, CIs are inherently 
linked to the CCP. 

Another difference: their implementation in universities and other foreign edu-
cational institutions “gives them leverage over the host institutions.”800 There was C

D even a case of  an implantation at the heart of  the education policy of  a target country: 
U
C the Ministry of  Education of  New-South Wales hosted a CI – a case presented as unique 
T
I in the world.801 In other words, Beijing had appointed employees (potentially agents) 
O
N inside an Australian ministry. This institute operated a Confucius Classroom program 

which state schools paid at least $10,000 annually (plus material resources such as books, 
which were graciously offered) to propose Chinese language and culture classes. Some 

C schools subsequently made them mandatory. This decision shocked many parents, some 
O describing this program “as the infiltration of  the Chinese Communist Party into the NSW 
N public school system.”802 Following this polemic, the state decided to stop the program in 
C
E December 2019. 
P Over the past couple of  years, China’s efforts have faced an increasing opposition 
T that has put a stop, or at least slowed, the implementation of  new institutions. Several uni-
S versities have also decided to shut down the Confucius Institutes they hosted, invoking, in 

particular, an infringement of  academic freedom. In July 2020, at least 50 universities in 
9 countries stopped the activities of  CIs implanted on their campuses – for instance, the 
University of  Chicago and Penn State in the United States, McMaster in Canada or Lyon in 
France (→ p. 305). In the United States, at least 15 of  them closed in 2018-2019.803 In 

A
C Australia, the state of  New South Wales announced, in August 2019, the closure of  the 13 
T Cis in its public schools.804 In Germany, the universities of  Düsseldorf  and Hamburg have 
O terminated CIs they hosted, and in several cities, including Ingolstadt and Göttingen, citi-
R zens’ collectives have been formed to end public subsidies or cooperation with local CIs.805 
S In response to Chinese sanctions against researchers and a German think tank (MERICS) 

in March 2021, the University of  Trier announced the suspension of  all activities of  its CI, 
a decision which the Minister of  Research welcomed a few months later by stating: “I do 
not want the Chinese government to influence our universities and our society. Germany 
must admit self-critically: in some places in the past, we have given too much space to 

A the Confucius Institutes, and have done too little ourselves to build up independent 
C
T China expertise in Germany.”806 Everywhere in the world, the problems have multi-
I plied and CIs are shut down. 
O The problems stemming from CIs have been summarized by a very thorough study of  
N
S the National Association of  Scholars (NAS) in 2017.807 The most frequent criticisms leveled 

against them referred to the pressure exerted on teachers to avoid subjects deemed sensitive 
in class (Tibet, Taiwan, Xinjiang, Human Rights, etc.), the restrictions on the teachers’ free-
dom of  expression and of  religion (prohibition of  Falun Gong for instance808) and a lack, 
or very little, of  transparence on the nature of  the relations between the institutes and the 
Hanban or other Chinese administrations.

• 1) Teachers. At the end of  2016, the CI headquarters in Beijing designed new recruit- D
U

ment criteria for teachers, first implemented in early 2017. They required “good C

political and professional qualities” (“具备良好的政治和业务素质”) and a “love T
I

for the homeland” (“爱祖国”) for instance.809 The word sushi (素质), often translated O
N

by “quality” encompasses the behavior, ethic, and education of  the individual. It is a 
marker of  belonging to the civilized world. To lack of  suzhi is to not be “civilized”; the 
word is thus often used to endorse a paternalistic politics or the refusal to hold elections C
to choose the country’s leaders, under the pretext that rural people are not of  “good O
enough quality.”810 According to the former Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin, who had N
defected to Australia in 2005, to have a “good political quality” means in this context to C

E
“always be faithful to the CCP and nothing else.”811 P

T
S

C

The required candidate profile: “good political and professional qualities, loves the homeland, works voluntarily for the O
internationalization of  the Chinese language, has a dedicated spirit, a strong sense of  organizational discipline and team spirit, R

with good character and no criminal record.”812 S

• 2) The learning material. The learning material is prepared by the Hanban and 
compliant with a Chinese vision of  the world. It is actually a preferred resource to 
convey the Party’s narrative abroad. The work is, in this case, eased by the young age 
of  this “literature’s” public, the children and teenagers, not yet able to confront the A
propaganda that, despite lacking in subtlety sometimes, can be effective due to the rep- C
etition of  the same message. The ability of  some students to defend themselves against T
such assaults can also be questioned. Here, the Chinese strategy can be illustrated by I

O
an animated documentary on the Korean War (1950-53), the War to Resist US N
Aggression and Aid Korea,813 proposed by the Hanban to young learners. The S
video explained that the United States manipulated the United Nations Security Council 
and that the Chinese army only went to war in response to the American bombings of  
Chinese villages and in order to protect the homeland (see screenshots below). The 
Hanban removed the video once its content was exposed.814

T • 3) Financial leverage on universities. The problem with CIs is not so much the 
S propaganda they spread but the influence they exert on university administrators, 

Salvatore Babone explained.815 Beijing delivers the institutes with the funding, teachers 
and their remuneration, the learning material, and sometimes even with the dedicated 
buildings. For universities – particularly those with tight budgets – being offered a rev-
enue-generating language center free of  charge is hard to refuse. This can create 

A
C a dependence, if  not a full subjection, that allows Beijing to have an influence on 
T certain choices of  the university, sometimes on the content of  some research programs 
O (to limit the research on Tibet, Taiwan, or China’s influence strategy for instance), on the 
R
S choice of  guest speakers, and ultimately, on the way the university speaks of  China and 

of  Chinese interests. In all cases, it creates a form of  self-censorship. 
• 4) Self-Censorship. Experience has shown that the presence of  CIs on a campus “com-
promised their institution’s commitment to academic freedom.”816 There are numerous 
documented cases of  self-censorship. In 2008, Tel Aviv University decided to close 

A an exhibition dedicated to the Falun Gong movement at the request of  the Chinese 
C Embassy.817 In 2009, at North Carolina State University, the Chinese director of  the CI 
T warned the university management that the Dalai Lama’s conference scheduled on the 
I
O campus could “damage” the relationship of  the university with the Hanban, thus forc-
N ing the former to cancel the event.818 In 2013, the prestigious University of  Sydney also 
S “cancelled the visit [of  the Dalai Lama] to avoid damaging its ties with China, including 

funding for its cultural Confucius Institute.”819 In 2014, Xu Lin (许琳), director of  the 
Hanban, then invited to the annual conference of  the European Association of  China 
studies at the University of  Minho in Portugal, demanded that the conference programs 
be rid of  several pages mentioning Taiwanese institutions, including the Chiang Ching-
Kuo Foundation.820 In December 2018, at Victoria University in Melbourne, the screen-

C ing of  a documentary critical of  CIs was cancelled at the last minute under pressure 
A
S from the Chinese consulate, and the university lied to the movie promoter, saying there 
E was no available room. Clive Hamilton highlighted the irony of  this situation: “a doc-

umentary arguing that the presence of  Confucius Institutes gives them politi-
cal leverage over their hosts was banned because of  the political leverage of  a

A closed Confucius Institute in Lyon
In France, where there are 18 Confucius Institutes left,822 the fate of  Lyon’s Confucius Institute C
(CIL) is interesting. Created in 2009 following a proposition of  Sun Yat-sen University O
(Guangzhou ) to the University Lyon 3, the relationship between the two parties started to N
deteriorate in 2012 after the appointment of  a new Chinese director: “He questioned our C
learning material and insisted that the CIL be more integrated in the university in order to be E
included in the core courses. We considered this interference from a structure emanating P
from China inappropriate because it was susceptible to compromise our academic T
freedom but also the spirit and rules of  higher education in the French Republic,” S
explained Gregory Lee, professor at the University Lyon 3. He paid the price: “the Hanban di-
rector demanded his head and announced the interruption of  the annual contribution without 
notice. […] Without an agreement, Lee closed the CIL in September 2013.”823

• 5) Effects on the teaching staff. Considering what was previously described, the A
implementation of  a CI in a university often brings about controversies, and is suscepti- C

T
ble to divide the teaching staff, if  not marginalize some of  the best specialists on China O
because they are critical of  CIs and, as such, of  their colleagues cooperating with the R
institute, or receiving its funding. In this situation, Christopher Hughes explains that S

“even the most well-established experts in Chinese studies can find themselves 
isolated and at odds with their colleagues when they raise concerns. The worst-
case scenario is when academics no longer feel able to work in a university that does not 
respect their professional standards, suffering from ostracization, exclusion from the 
university and denial of  promotion [for instance].”824 A

C
• 6) Effects on other researchers. Pressure from a CI affects not only immediate col- T
leagues at the university, but it can also extend to the regional or national research and I
think tank landscape. For example, in April 2021, the Slovak director of  Bratislava’s O
CI, Ľuboslav Štora, attempted to intimidate Matej Šimalčík, the director of  the Central N

S
European Institute of  Asia Studies (CEIAS) and one of  the leading China experts in 
Central Europe. He sent him a letter attacking him over the publication of  a report on 
Chinese influence in Slovak universities,825 with explicit threats: “Are you sleeping well? 
You should be very stressed when you walk down the street….”826

D • 7) Espionage. Jonathan Manthorpe believes that the Confucius program is noth-
U
C ing more than “a major CCP international propaganda and espionage operation 
T
I masquerading as a cultural exchange program.”827 It is not only, as Li Changchun, a 
O
N member of  the Permanent Committee of  the Political Bureau, publicly acknowledged, 

“an important part of  China’s overseas propaganda set-up;”828 in most cases “they are 
espionage outstations for Chinese embassies and consulates through which they 

C control Chinese students, gather information on perceived enemies, and intim-
O idate dissidents.”829 However, documented cases of  espionage are rare, and Western 
N counter-espionage services do not always have an interest in making them public. Among 
C
E the most well-known examples is the case of  the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) CI 
P director, Song Xinning, who, in 2019, was expulsed and banned from the Schengen area 
T for eight years after the Belgian services accused him of  espionage – and more specif-
S ically, of  being a recruiter for Chinese intelligence.830 Following that event, the VUB 

decided to close its CI. 

The wave of  Confucius Institute closures gained momentum in the last few 
A years and should further spread as a result of  the awareness of  Chinese influence 
C strategies, and of  the growing tensions between Beijing and Washington. To try to 
T counter this tendency, the CCP decided to rename the Hanban as the Center for Language 
O Education and Cooperation in June 2020.831 The announcement by the press agency Xinhua 
R
S did not specify that it was an actual change of  name, nor did it explain the reasons behind 

this change, giving stock to the belief  that it might have been a new institution.832 Xu Lin, 
likely judged unfit to accompany this change in the image of  the institutes, was replaced by 
Ma Jianfei, her deputy. The Party also created a non-governmental foundation promoting 
teaching Chinese abroad to oversee the institutes. This structure is thus supposed to act as 
a buffer between the institutes and the Party.

I
O Hanyuqiao (汉语桥), literally “bridge to Chinese” (also translated as “gateway to 
N
S Chinese”), and which has been known in English as the Chinese Bridge Program, started 

as a linguistic and cultural competition organized by the Hanban with help from the 
network of  Confucius Institutes. CIs organize the pre-selections in the various countries 
where they are implanted and send the best candidates from each country to participate in 
the semifinals, followed by the finals, in China. The selected candidates only have to pay for 
their roundtrip plane fare while Beijing takes care of  the rest – housing and food.833 The 

C competition is broadcast on the Hunan Television (湖南卫视) channel and is available on 
streaming platforms such as Mango TV (芒果TV).834

It targets an audience of  non-Chinese young individuals born outside of  China D
U

and for whom Chinese is not the mother tongue. Their oral and written comprehension C

is assessed with their Chinese speaking abilities and artistic qualities. The winners eventu- T
I

ally earn scholarships to study in the PRC. O

This competition has two formats: the first, the Chinese Proficiency Competition for 
Foreign College Students has been held since 2002 and is open to university students; the 
second is the Chinese Proficiency for Foreign Secondary Students, launched in 2008 C
for high-schoolers. According to numbers provided by the Hanban, around 800,000 uni- O
versity students and 300,000 high-schoolers participated in the preselection stage and 3,000 N
university students from over 110 countries, along with 2,700 high-schoolers from over 100 C

E
countries, were selected to take part to the semifinals and finals in China.835 P

The objective of  these competitions is to spark interest in the Chinese language and T
culture among a young foreign public, and to stimulate international exchanges. As attested S
by the way the Handan reported on these events, these competitions are an occasion to 
“build a ‘circle of  friends’ worldwide thanks to Chinese,” but also to “show [one’s] talents 
to follow [one’s] Chinese dream” to “tell together ‘[about one’s] affection for China.’”836

The Hanban’s Hanyuqiao has in fact expanded to formats beyond the competitions: the 
Chinese Bridge Summer Camp invites foreign high school students for a summer A

C
camp in China during which they can attend language classes but also classes on tradi- T
tional cultural practices (calligraphy, martial arts, traditional dances, tea ceremonies etc.), O
and meet with other youth with an interest in China from all over the world.837 This pro- R

S
gram also aims to stimulate a passion for learning Chinese and Chinese culture in general, 
along with imbuing these teenagers with official Chinese narratives. 

Schools and teachers are other targets of  the Hanyuqiao. The Chinese Bridge for 
Foreign Schools invites the teaching staff  who have already established a Chinese pro-
gram at their schools, or who has the intention of  doing so, to spend a week in China, not 
only to promote cooperation between the schools, but also to improve their knowledge of  A
the Chinese education system and promote the learning of  Chinese abroad.838 European, C

T
British and American schools are primarily targeted. According to the Hanban’s web- I
site, it apparently invites, each year, the teaching staff  of  100 primary and secondary schools O
from the European Union,839 100 British schools, and, since 2007, it has invited some 450 N

S
British delegates in China,840 along with 3,000 American delegates since 2006.841

C
T
I We have previously shown how the Party attempts to build the image of  a powerful 
O
N China, with a power that rests, among other things, on the development of  the country’s 

scientific and technological capacities (→ p. 159). The promotion of  that narrative is paired 
with important efforts to impose itself  in the field of  ideas. It is about seducing with 

C China’s capacity to produce concepts and to raise its voice in international intel-
O lectual debates. To do so, the CCP’s strategy is twofold: on the one hand, setting up 
N
C branches of  Chinese think tanks abroad, whose mission is to showcase the Chinese 
E intellectual power by inserting themselves in the local intellectual and political debates; on 
P the other hand, similarly to the United Front’s strategy consisting in using one’s friends 
T against one’s enemies, the Party-State also tries to get closer to the existing structures 
S

susceptible to assimilate and share Chinese narratives.

A. The international development of  Chinese think-tanks 
A
C Beyond the relays the CCP is susceptible to find in foreign think tanks and foundations, 
T its strategy in the field of  ideas consists in reinforcing the Chinese presence in inter-
O national debates. To do so, and in accordance to Xi Jinping’s spoken exhortation to the 
R 19th Congress to build “new think tanks with Chinese characteristics,” these institutions 
S have developed their activities abroad and branches in several target countries, notably in 

Europe. They have organized “academic” events with foreign think tanks and universi-
ties, and tried to sign cooperation agreements. This strategy allows them to establish a 
sense of  respectability for Chinese think tanks, of  which most are tied to the CCP,842 and 
to spread official narratives. 

A For instance, on October 4 and 5, 2018, the Fudan Institute of  Belt and Road 
C
T Global Governance (BRGG) participated in an event organized by the Confucius 
I Institute of  the University of  Edinburgh on “The Belt & Road Initiative: Challenges and 
O Opportunities.”843 On this occasion, the Shanghai-based think tank and the Future Institute 
N of  Edinburgh signed a memorandum in order to foster their cooperation and research 
S

on the silk roads. Yet, and even if  the BRGG presents itself  as a think tank tied to Fudan 
University, a bundle of  concordant traces reveal close links with the Party. Its objective 
is not limited to spreading the Party’s narrative – or, to promote the Silk Roads, as it was 
announced by its director at the launch in 2017844 – but its director Jiao Yang (焦扬) is also 
the Party’s secretary at Fudan University, after several stints in the propaganda services of  
the city of  Shanghai.845

C  In addition, the China Daily affirmed, when the Fudan think tank 
A was created, that it was financially supported by the China Energy Fund Committee (CEFC 
S Energy).846 If  the Hong Kong-based CEFC describes itself  as a non-state think tank ded-
E icated to the promotion of  international dialogue, it is a branch of  CEFC China Energy 

Company Limited, which we mentioned before (→ p. 117). It was founded and headed by

Chinese think tanks are multiplying cooperation agreements with foreign organizations to 
facilitate the circulation of  the Party’s narrative. Some go even further and set up branches

1. CGTN think tank C
E
P

On December 4, 2019, during the third CGTN Global Media Summit dedicated to T
“media and technologies,” Beijing announced the creation of  a CGTN think tank. The S
event was held in the presence of  Shen Haixiong (慎海雄), deputy director of  the propa-
ganda department.

The CGTN think tank is presented by its instigators as a media think tank – a new T
generation of  think tanks that can lean on the enormous information gathering capaci- I

O
ties of  media outlets like CGTN. The idea is to combine the capabilities of  these two N
types of  structures: the impressive data gathering capacities of  the media and the S
analyzing skills of  think tanks. The Chinese media that reported on the event have 
explained that this endeavor was motivated by the difficulty to organize a rational debate 
at the international level, along with the weakness of  the Chinese voice in the concert of  
nations. Beijing’s ambition is thus to create an exchange platform that leaves room for the 
promotion of  the opinions of  Chinese intellectuals and experts, and to ultimately improve 
the understanding of  China in the world.850 C

According to Chinese media, the CGTN think tank has already signed about fifty partner- A
S

ships with foreign think tanks, including the Schiller Institute (→ p. 326). Twenty-seven E
institutions were present during the inaugural event on December 4. And several political 

847. Ye Jianming was also the economic advisor of  the Czech president, Miloš Zeman. He was arrested in March 
2018 for corruption (→ p. 265).

O

Belgium prime minister) and Han Seung-soo (former South Korean prime minister).851 
Since the launch, the CGTN think tank has not communicated much on its development, 

C partnerships, or even on its activities; it is then difficult to evaluate its precise place in the field, 
O and a fortiori, its impact on the international stage, which altogether seems relatively modest. 
N CGTN’s pseudopod introduced itself  on the media’s website as a think tank like any 
C
E other, and, to add stock to this statement, it offered a video that explained “what a think 
P tank is.” However, far from showcasing or presenting Chinese think tanks, this video, pro-
T duced by a Western communication firm, features Western think tanks. In this way, CGTN 
S tried to incorporate its think tank in the international think tank community by association, 

to benefit from the legitimacy of  others.

Overall, CGTN’s think tank seems to be yet another relay susceptible to spread China’s 
A
C voice or, in other words, to broadcast CCP narratives we previously identified. The adver-
T tisement above of  a debate organized on the efficiency of  Traditional Chinese Medicine 
I (→ p. 152) to cure the Covid-19 is but one example. The Chinese think tank also took part 
O to the campaign that disseminated counter-narratives on the epidemic and highlighted the 
N
S efficiency of  China’s crisis management. For instance, CGTN organized debates defending 

that the virus might not have been from China (→ p. 589).
Strictly-speaking, CGTN’s think tank is thus a networking tool more than an idea-pro-

ducing institution. 

2. Offensive on Central and Eastern Europe (The China-CEE Institute and the 
C SASS)
A
S China specifically targets Central and Eastern European countries through the 
E 16+1 cooperation format created in 2012,852 and renamed 17+1 with the addition of  

Greece in 2019, then again 16+1 with the departure of  Lithuania in May 2021. The format 
is asymmetrical – not because China is alone in front of  17 other countries, but because it 
weights far more than all of  its interlocutors combined. Incidentally, it clearly falls within

a logic of  “ the strong against the weak,” and the Party-State uses this channel to pro- D

mote its vision and its initiatives, notably the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It is also C

meant to divide Europe since this format brings together European Union members and T
I

countries with a pending (or no) membership (Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, O
N

and Albania). Diplomatic sources have confirmed that Beijing uses this format to try to 
play countries against the EU, amplifying existing fault lines, fueling resentment, such 
as when it spreads the idea that the countries of  Central and Eastern Europe are “less well C
treated” than Western European countries. In addition, the Party-State seems to be thinking O
about expanding this group to other non-EU countries, to diminish the influence of  mem- N
ber states and give added influence to EU critics. C

U
C of  the Chinese Academy of  Social Sciences (CASS), and Huang Ping, the executive director 
T
I of  the China-CEE Institute (see picture above).854

O
N The China-CEE Institute is derived from the CASS. Huang Ping is, in fact, the direc-

tor of  its European Studies Institute, under which authority the China-CEE Institute is. 
If  it proudly displays its independence with respect to European structures, this is due to 

C the refusal of  the Institute of  World Economy of  the Hungarian Academy of  Sciences to 
O cooperate with the CASS, due to the future think tank’s then-blurry objectives and gover-
N nance mechanisms.855
C
E The China-CEE conducts two types of  activities: organizing conferences and sympo-
P siums, with Chinese researchers visiting Europe in particular, and the publication of  notes, 
T reports and books. According to its 2019 annual report, it organized four international 
S summits, three workshops, and seven conferences, published 10 studies, 8 books and over 

800 weekly notes covering the 17 Central and Eastern European countries that year.856

The think tank is, first and foremost, interested in the relations between China and 
Central and Eastern European countries, which are systematically presented as 
positive and mutually beneficial. In fact, an important part of  its work focuses on ana-

A
C lyzing these countries. The image of  China in Central and Eastern Europe is among 
T the topics it closely monitors. A study and numerous books have been published on the 
O topic since 2017: some have dealt with the region in general, others with one country in 
R particular, or with the general image of  China, while others have examined foreign rep-
S resentations on specific topics.857 Unsurprisingly, the think tank played an important role 

during the Covid-19 crisis, relaying the Party’s discourse and evaluating its adherence among 
European public opinions.

Beyond the diffusion of  the Party’s discourse, the China-CEE Institute seemingly plays 
another, subtler, role in the CCP’s influence machinery. By gathering around the institute 

A and its projects an increasing number of  local researchers working closely or indirectly on 
C
T China, and by forging ties with those countries’ authorities to be present in the heart of  
I their research systems, the Institute prevents the emergence – or the survival – of  inde-
O pendent research on China. In that regard, there is a growingly notable bias in the formu-
N
S lation of  questions in some PhD thesis on China. Its considerable financial resources allow 

the Chinese think tank to dominate this fragile market. The issue however, does not solely 
concerns Central and Eastern Europe as we saw previously (→ p. 286): the entire field, in 
Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, needs to ensure the conditions for 
independent research on China.

China-CEE is not the first Chinese think tank to be implanted in the West. In 
C 2015, China created the Institute for China-American Studies (ICAS) in Washington. 
A Inaugurated with great fanfare in the presence of  Henry Kissinger, and conceived to spread 
S China’s voice in Washington’s ecosystem, particularly on maritime issues, the ICAS remains 
E an insignificant actor whose work is unknown to most American leaders.858 Its presence 

on social networks is negligible, it organized less than an event per month in 2019, and it

tive strategies through its think tanks. It seems that the implementation of  the CASS’s C

Hungary, Europe’s soft underbelly for Beijing P
T

Hungary’s Prime minister since 2010, and champion of  “illiberalism,” Viktor Orbán is known S
for holding sympathetic positions in the EU toward the “great authoritarians” states, Russia 
(he asked for the withdrawal of  European sanctions), Turkey and China. Within a decade, he 
turned Hungary into the “bridgehead of  China in Europe.”860 The first European country to 
sign a deal with Beijing as part of  the Bridge and Roads Initiative (BRI), Hungary is the prime 
destination for Chinese investment in Central and Eastern Europe. Several big Hungarian 
companies, such as BorsodChem (the biggest national chemicals producer), were bought by A
Chinese companies.861 Beijing initiated several major infrastructure works, including the high- C
speed railway line between Budapest and Belgrade that, as part of  the BRI, aims to shorten T
the distance between the Greek port Piraeus, which was also ceded to a Chinese company, O
and the center of  Europe; and the construction of  “the biggest, most modern rail terminal in R
Europe,” close to the Ukrainian border, which will welcome all the trains coming from China, S
and was branded the “Western gate” of  ‘the new silk roads.’” 
In Hungary, and contrary to more and more European countries, Huawei can deploy a 5G net-
work. Furthermore, during the Covid-19 epidemic, an “aerial bridge” on which the Hungarian 
government heavily communicated, delivered more than 90 million masks and 40 million pro-
tection cloths from China; and, in late January 2021, Hungary became the first EU country 
to approve a Chinese vaccine (Sinopharm). In September 2021, the Hungarian government 
signed a letter of  intent with Sinopharm to build an infrastructure for the local production A
of  the Chinese vaccine within ten months.862 It is also in Budapest that Fudan University will C
build the first Chinese campus in Europe, on a gigantic 130-hectare plot – the government T
announced it two years after banning the Central European University (CEU), which was I
attacked for having been founded and financed by the U.S. billionaire of  Hungarian descent O
George Soros. He is considered by Orbán as an enemy of  the state; And yet, the Court of  N
Justice of  the EU considered this decision contrary to European law.863 The construction could S
be contracted to the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), which has 
been “suspected of  corruption and espionage in many parts of  the world in recent years” 
(this is the company that bugged the African Union headquarters, for example → p. 130). It 
apparently use mostly Chinese labor and materials, at a cost of  €1.5 billion – more than the 
country spent on its entire higher education system in 2019 – a budget “mainly financed by a 
Chinese loan, which Hungary would pay for.”864 This Hungarian branch of  Fudan University 
should open in 2024 and quickly grow to accommodate 330 teachers, 150 administrative staff  
and 5,000 students, including 500 PhD students, by 2028.865 C

D To complement the efforts of  the China-CEE Institute, Beijing has more recently launched

T

O

to follow suit (→ p. 644), and the states of  the region are less and less naïve about Beijing’s 
ambitions. Hence, Beijing has focused on the Visegrád Group (Czech Republic, Hungary, 

C Poland, Slovakia) by creating a Research Center for the Visegrád Group within the Shanghai 
O Academy of  Social Sciences (SASS) in January 2021. Headed by Wang Jian (王健), who also

P SASS is a powerful vehicle: founded in 1958, the oldest Chinese think tank in social sciences, it 
T is one of  the best endowed and politically connected academic organizations in China. Some

O

S 1. Think tanks

The CCP has built a vast network of  relationships with think tanks and founda-
tions around the world. These structures cooperate with China to varying degrees and 
for a variety of  reasons. Some simply organize events with China on an ad hoc basis, while 
others have developed relatively extensive collaborative programs that espouse the Chinese 

C reading of  international relations. Some identify a community of  interest or ideology with 
A Beijing, while others are only driven by greed. These partners compensate for the weak-
S nesses of  the Chinese presence in international debates. 
E A special effort has been dedicated to supporting the Belt and Road Initiative 

(BRI), with dedicated platforms such as the Belt and Road Think Tank Cooperation 
Alliance (一带一路智库合作联盟). The Alliance brings together some 50 Chinese 
research institutions and its international branch (Belt and Road International Think Tank

In the following pages, we distinguish three categories, or degrees, of  Chinese influence 
through local think tanks, according to criteria that will be detailed: occasional partners, C
circumstantial allies, and accomplices. To avoid any misunderstanding, it is important to O
add that here, as elsewhere in this report which focuses on how the Party-State designs and N
implements its influence operations, these categories are to be understood from Beijing’s C

E
point of  view, and not from the point of  view of  local relays, who generally do not have the P
impression of  being partners, allies or, even less, accomplices. What we are saying is that this is T
how Beijing sees and uses them, whether they are aware of  it or not. S

We will give examples that are illustrative: they allow us to understand what, in concrete 
terms, these relations consist of. In no way do they constitute judgments on the quality of  
the institutions and individuals cited, or even on their positions vis-à-vis China: it is not a 
question of  whether they are “pro-Beijing” – most are not -, only that the partner-
ships they establish, especially with the Chinese embassy, the events they organize A

C
or in which they participate, the Party magazines in which they publish, or the sto- T
ries they disseminate, de facto contribute to China’s influence. This is the case even O
if  they also know how to be critical of  Beijing, because one does not cancel out the other. R

S
This is not to say that these think tanks should not have relations with the Chinese 
authorities. Dialogue is fundamental: it is important to continue to see and talk to each 
other. Other institutions, including IRSEM, and the authors of  this report, also receive 
Chinese delegations in private, even from the PLA, and carry out missions in China.869 The 
difference with the examples given in the following pages is that, in so doing, no resonance 
or publicity is given to the Party’s propaganda – and, moreover, the Party-State can be more A
freely contradicted, since there is no fear that it will end a partnership. C

a. Occasional partners O
N

This first category refers to think tanks, foundations and research centers which, far from S
championing the Chinese model, serve as a sounding board on local markets of  ideas. 
Actors in this category may be directly solicited by Beijing, especially when it is ‘simply’ a 
matter of  co-organizing events designed by the Party. Other organizations may however 
volunteer their services. These partnerships are beneficial to the Party because, with limited 
efforts, they expand its contact area and acceptability on foreign land. When a reputable 
think tank organizes an event with China, Beijing is looking for that organization’s ability C
to get the Party’s message across. Rather than the scientific dimension of  the interventions, A

S
it is their compatibility with the Chinese discourse and their ability to be heard by a large E
section of  the population that appeals to China. 

Think tanks in this category generally have a certain credibility on the national or even 
international scene, and a pluralistic production. They do not work specifically on China and 
they maintain relations with a large number of  countries, including the United States and

C The “Paris Forum on the ‘Belt and Road’ Initiative”, co-organized since 2017 by 
O the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS) and the Chinese 
N Embassy in France, belongs to this category. This event makes a laudatory presentation of  
C
E Chinese narratives on the New Silk Roads. Three sessions have so far been held: November 29, 
P 2017, January 10, 2019 and December 19, 2019.870 The forums are systematically introduced 
T by the Chinese ambassador to France. And, according to an observer, “all criticism 
S has been carefully stifled,” and the events aim “above all to communicate in order to 

appease fears about this enormous plan launched in 2013 by the Chinese president, Xi 
Jinping.”871 Commentating on the first edition, the newspaper La Lettre A also believed that 
“the conference gave the impression of  a lobbying operation in favor of  the Chinese project,” 
with speakers who, in their large majority, “acted as fervent proponents of  a French adhesion 

A
C to the Chinese project.”872 Several researchers “have underlined the apparent ‘docility’ of  the 
T speakers at these conferences and questioned a possible influence from Beijing’ on the institute. 
O Pascal Boniface [IRIS’ director] firmly denied these accusations.”873

I During the first forum in 2017, the Chinese embassy handled most of  the interventions 
O on the Chinese side. The participating Chinese think tanks were structures of  the state 
N
S apparatus. For example, the China Institute of  International Studies (CIIS – 中国国际问

题研究所) is the official think tank of  the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs; and the 
China Institutes of  Contemporary International Relations (CICIR – 中国现代国际关系
研究院) is considered a branch of  the Ministry of  State Security.874 The composition of

C identified: a large part of  the CICIR staff  is trained, and even teaches, at the University of  International Studies (国际

C the Central Investigation Department of  the CCP (中共中央调查), which was integrated into the Ministry of  State 
L Security when it was created in 1983 (→ p. 81). See also the Baidu pages (in Chinese) of  the university and the DCI:

the forum changed little in subsequent sessions, with most Chinese speakers coming from D
U

Party-State structures and passing its narratives on. C

It was also striking to note that specific warnings expressed by speakers about the Chinese T
I

project, notably that it must respect a number of  principles, were coined in the very terms O
N

of  the debate constructed by the Party. These speakers thus validated the ambitions of  the 
CCP through the vocabulary it had forged. This observation applied especially to politi-
cal actors, who are the Chinese authorities’ preferred targets as they are “easier” C
to influence than researchers. For instance, at the second session on January 10, 2019, O
Christian Cambon, senator of  Val-de-Marne and chairman of  the Committee on Foreign N
Affairs, Defense and the Armed Forces, declared about the BRI: “[we] are starting to real- C

E
ize that this is a much more important ambition [that we previously thought] that aims to P
create a new world order based on the development of  exchanges which presents many T
advantages […] from this point of  view, it seems to us that a certain number of  specific S
points must be respected, notably the win-win principle.”875 The adoption of  this Chinese 
expression placed the debate in some sort of  tautology. China is invited to propose a “win-
win” project, which happens to be precisely the Chinese leitmotif. The senator borrowed 
additional elements from the Chinese narrative: first, the inevitability of  China’s rise to 
power, which could only lead to the decision to work with it; second, the representation of  A

C
the Silk Roads as a factor of  peace in the world. All this illustrates the prevalence of  the T
vocabulary conveyed by the Chinese Embassy in the French debate. O

Another feature of  this debate was worth noting: the comparison between the United R
S

States and China; the idea that, since we cooperate with the United States, there is no legiti-
mate reason to refuse to cooperate with China. According to this idea, France should adopt 
a kind of  “equidistant diplomacy,” as if  the country was as far away from China as from 
the US. This way of  equalizing China and the United States is widespread in France, 
without being really explained or justified. 

Under these conditions, it is evident that, from the embassy’s point of  view, an event A
such as the “Paris Forum on the ‘Belt and Road’ Initiative” serves first and foremost to C

T
promote the Silk Roads in France, while leaving the French public with the impres- I
sion that China is willing to discuss its foreign policy. In this way, such an action helps O
reinforce the positive image of  China. N

S
These events are not the only ones in which IRIS interacts with the Chinese embassy. As 

we will see (→ p. 344), IRIS Director Pascal Boniface and, to a lesser extent, IRIS senior 
research fellow Barthélémy Courmont have also participated in events organized by or with 
the Chinese Embassy or Party agencies.876 As we shall also see, IRIS maintains ties with the 
publishing house La Route de la Soie, founded and directed by Sonia Bressler, which 
notably published Maxime Vivas’s polemical book on Uyghurs (→ p. 335). Not only have C
Pascal Boniface and IRIS researchers published articles in three of  the first eight issues of  A
the journal Dialogue Chine-France, which La Route de la Soie co-publishes with an organiza- S
tion dependent on the CCP’s Propaganda Department (→ p. 341), but Courmont (IRIS) E

is also an author and series editor at La Route de la Soie, and IRIS has published a note

D by Bressler on “China Bashing” (→ p. 343). IRIS has also published Pierre Picquart,877 a 
U
C researcher known for relaying Beijing’s positions. The author of  several books, all of  them 
T
I apologetic,878 Picquart frequently appears in Chinese media (but also in Russian media, 
O
N notably RT and Sputnik), to explain, for instance, that “the violence caused by demonstra-

tors in Hong Kong is disturbing and intolerable,” that “never in world history has a country 
evolved so favorably than China has in 70 years,” or that “the CCP is leading the Chinese 

C to achieve remarkable accomplishments.”879 Systematically presented in these media as a 
O “doctor in geopolitics and human geography from the University Paris VIII” as if  to better 
N make him play the role of  a scientific guarantee, his positions are relayed by the Chinese 
C
E embassy (→ p. 234), and he has participated in events organized by it.880

P Despite all this, it is important to note that IRIS also sometimes publishes less China-
T friendly notes. The structure seems to maintain a relative pluralism, and both Boniface and 
S Courmont know how to be critical of  Beijing as well. For example, Boniface publicly defended 

Valérie Niquet when she announced that she was being sued for defamation by Huawei in 
November 2019 (→ p. 53),881 and Antoine Bondaz when he was attacked by the Chinese 
embassy in March 2021882 – which, according to Libération, may have led IRIS to reevaluate its 
relationship with the embassy (→ p. 239). In other words, while their occasional relationship 

A
C with Chinese authorities, such as sometimes giving the floor to Party relays, or participating 
T in CCP-driven publications or events, de facto contributes to Chinese influence operations 
O in France – which justifies the presence of  this example in this report – there is no indica-
R tion that this is a conscious effort. Unlike other actors described in the following pages, 
S there is no defense of  the Chinese model here. This is why, in the gradation of  influence 

through think tanks that we have established, this is only its first degree.

that he “co-launched.”911 Among other projects, the two organizations co-organized the 
“Forum on the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals” on September 17-18, 2020912;
- the China Institute of  International Studies (CIIS), the official think tank of  the

C conference (“France-China Cooperation: Identifying Common Values and Visions for 
T
I Shared Action”) on August 29, 2021,913 with the participation of  two former Chinese 
O and two former French ambassadors. Yu Jiang, the vice president of  CIIS, also attended.

Research Center (习近平外交思想研究中心), set up by the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs 
and affiliated to the CIIS.914

While these interactions make The Bridge Tank an occasional partner of  Chinese author-
ities, it is important to note that this think tank does not defend the Chinese model, nor

both directions: in this case, The Bridge Tank uses the multiple channels it maintains with O

Chinese authorities to defend French positions, particularly in the fight against global 
warming and for the preservation of  biodiversity, a subject it has frequently addressed since 
the COP21. During a January 21, 2021 seminar co-organized with the embassy, for instance, C
several French speakers mentioned France’s strategic interests and pointed out certain short- O
comings in the draft comprehensive agreement between the EU and China on investments. N

b. Circumstantial allies P
Actors in this category not only collaborate occasionally with the Chinese Embassy and/ T

S
or Party agencies but, without sharing the CCP’s ideology or even its strategic objectives, they 
believe that it is in their interest – of  whatever nature they may be – to spread the Party’s 
narratives on a regular basis. Their motivations are diverse: for some, it may be anti-Amer-
icanism, which means opposing American power rather than adhering to Chinese values; for 
others, it may be opportunism, as China can help struggling institutions increase their influ- A
ence or help them reinvent themselves. In any case, these institutions often act as spokesper- C
sons for China by providing an effective vehicle for Beijing’s discursive strategies. In doing so, T

O
they too participate in building a positive image of  China’s power. R

The fact that these think tanks are pluralistic, sometimes formulating criticisms of  the S
Party-State, and working on other subjects, including the United States and Europe, does not 
change anything, since they nonetheless reproduce Chinese narratives. From Beijing’s point 
of  view, this dissemination is even more efficient when it is diluted in a pluralistic 
whole, since the transmitter will be less suspected of  playing into China’s hands.

A
The example of  the French Prospective and Innovation Foundation (FPI) C

In France, the Fondation Prospective et Innovation (FPI) illustrates this second cat- T
egory. Created in 1989 by François Dalle and René Monory, who was then a president I

O
of  the Vienne General Council, minister of  the Economy and president of  the Senate, N
it initially ambitioned to create a discussion about “continuities inherited from the past” S
and the “factors of  the future.” It was symbolically established at Poitiers’ Futuroscope 
(imagined by René Monory). Today, Jean-Pierre Raffarin (a former prime minister) leads 
the foundation. Since 2006, however, it moved from its original objectives to focus on 
three main areas916: understanding and appreciating rising new powers, such as China or 
Africa; stimulating competitiveness by enlightening and supporting companies, especially 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and intermediate-sized enterprises (ISEs); and C
participating in the design of  a new global, national, and local governance. A

S
Over the past decade, China has clearly become the preferred theme of  the foundation. E

At least half  the publications and the majority of  its activities have dealt with China, 
with continued growth over the period that could indicate that the foundation prefers, 
when it comes to China, organizing events rather than publishing documents – perhaps

D because it is a more appropriate vehicle to influence the political elite.917 The real number 
U
C is probably even higher because some publications and activities officially dedicated to cur-
T
I rent affairs were in fact almost exclusively about China, and usually at its advantage. This 
O
N was notably the case of  the forum organized by the FPI at the Futuroscope on August 27, 

2021. Behind a neutral title (“Les vertiges du monde. Retrouver l’équilibre” [The Vertigo 
of  the World. Finding a Balance Again]), it was indeed devoted to the relations to Beijing.918 

C Among the speakers, and in addition to Jean-Pierre Raffarin, were Pascal Boniface, director 
O of  IRIS (→ p. 316);919 Kishore Mahbubani, one of  the main pro-Chinese intellectuals on the 
N international scene and in the Singaporean debate (→ p. 515) – the interrogative title of  his 
C
E latest book (Has China Won?) has interestingly been translated by an affirmation in French 
P (Le jour où la Chine va gagner [The Day China Wins]920) – or André Chieng, the vice-president 
T of  the Comité France-Chine, a group of  French companies with interests in China that Xi 
S Jinping personally thanked for having “played an active role in Franco-Chinese economic 

exchanges. [The Committee] has contributed a lot to the economy of  our two countries.”921

The figures are revealing, but the content of  the publications and interventions of  
FPI members is even clearer in setting the institution’s role in incorporating and propa-
gating many narratives constructed by the Party:

A
C • On China as the savior of  an international order sabotaged by the United States: 
T “At a time when the United States paralyzed the WTO by refusing to renew the members 
O of  the Dispute Settlement Body, after it dealt a major blow to the Paris Climate agree-
R
S ments, after it refused to redistribute voting rights at the IMF, after it killed the Iranian 

nuclear agreement, it is essential to encourage China to participate actively in defining 
and adapting the international order.”922

• On a “win-win” China as an opportunity for France: “China is adept of  ‘win-win’ 
solutions. It is constantly striving to develop formulas where each of  the stakeholders 

A can benefit from their engagement. For the French, who are used to a highly organized 
C market, being forced to adapt to a constantly changing market is a great opportunity.”923

T
I • On the “community of  common destiny” dear to Xi Jinping (which is nothing 
O more than a project of  Sinicization of  the international system): “In recent times we 
N have been able to measure the importance of  China’s choices, notably through concrete 
S support for the euro, during our debt crisis, or on the occasion of  the Paris Climate 

agreements. We can also recall China’s positive attitudes toward international organiza-

917. In January 2021, the IPF website listed 26 publications (since October 2011) out of  52 on China, compared to only 
C 10 on foresight and innovation, 7 on Africa and the Middle East, 5 on European democracy and multilateralism, 2 on the state 
A of  the world, and 2 on culture and religion; as well as 98 events (since April 2008) out of  177 (https://archive.vn/OfAJv). 
S Since then, the site has been redesigned, with new headings and a different distribution, but you can see on the books page, for 
E example, that about half  of  them are about China (https://prospective-innovation.org/publications/livres/).

T

• On the United States as a more significant threat than China: “one can well I
O

imagine that once the compromise with China has been found and finalized, it will be N

Europe’s turn. One can wonder what interest Europe can still find in being an ally of  the 
United States. There is talk of  a Chinese threat, but it is a potential one: America’s threat 
is present. Between the two, Europe must seek independence and balance.”925 C

O
• On Chinese companies as a counterbalance to U.S. companies: “Currently, the N
GAFAs (Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon) dominate the world, and the only C
ones that can balance them are the BATXs (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi). The E

P
GAFAs operate without counterweight on French territory: neither France nor Europe T
has anything to oppose to them. The BATXs weight a lot on the Chinese market but not S
on the international market: there is something to be negotiated there.”926

• On the BRI as the vector of  a new era from which Europeans would be wrong 
to remain on the sidelines: “[China’s] Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is charting a path 
for this global synergy from which China intends to create a new global era in the future. 

A
China is astonished and deplores that Europeans are so reluctant to commit themselves C
to the BRI but it no longer waits for them. From now on, China is moving forward. We T
are wrong to remain petrified in the face of  the [the BRI]. For it is good news.”927 O

R
• On the diversity of  political regimes, which are different but respectable: “Our sys- S
tems are different and not meant to be similar”;928 “We need a delicate discourse to defend 
our interests precisely, but without attacking others. We must acknowledge Xi Jinping’s 
unambiguous statement: his country wants to be socialist with Chinese characteristics. We 
need to respect his opinion while making clear that we do not share this approach.”929

• On Xi Jinping as a Gaullist figure whose vocation is to bring the country to the A
place it deserves: “Often misinterpreted by Western media as a Stalin-like return to C

personal power, he has in fact a Gaullist character: The proof  of  this is publicly given by T
I

the formation of  a very high-quality management team and the elevation of  the status O
of  the new helmsman by one rank.”930 N

S
• On power put at the service of  peace: “China is introducting itself  as a peaceful 
power, aspiring to more regulated and profitable exchanges based on mutual respect.”931

• On the fact that opposing China’s legitimate expansion would be both vain and 
childish: “In the face of  the rising tide, only kids can build sand dams. Faced with this 
China, which, as we can see, has profoundly and impressively renewed itself, pretending 
to stand in the way of  its ambitions is illusory and counterproductive; they are, after all, C
perfectly legitimate.”932 A

c. The accomplices
A third category involves think tanks and foundations that share a common vision 

C of  the world with the CCP and whose interests are mainly convergent. That makes 
O them collaborate with the Chinese authorities and relay their stories but also defend China’s 
N
C image in all circumstances.
E
P The example of  the International Schiller Institute
T
S The Schiller Institute illustrates this third category. It was founded in 1984 by Helga 

Zepp-LaRouche,933 who wished to give substance to the ideas of  Friedrich von Schiller, a 
18th-century poet, playwright and art theorist. These ideas were delineated during the Third 
International Conference that the Institute organized on November 24 and 25, 1984, in 
Washington, and which led to the “Declaration of  the Inalienable Rights of  Man.” This 

A charter was meant to denounce the excesses of  supranational financial institutions and the 
C “tyranny” that they inflict on less developed countries.934 The Schiller Institute wished to 
T
O bring about a new world in which “war, poverty and the wounds that affect us will appear as 
R the relics of  an outdated world.”935 While promoting peace through economic development 
S and respect for the sovereignty of  nations, the Schiller Institute has also been active in the 

dialogue of  cultures and insisted on a better understanding of  the “advantage of  others,” a 
concept that Jacques Cheminade described as inspired by the Peace of  Westphalia (1648).936

The Schiller Institute has developed its activities in many countries. Five seem to receive 
special attention, with sister structures working under the umbrella of  the International 

A Schiller Institute: Germany (Schiller-Institut, Vereinigung für Staatskunst e. V.), the United 
C States (Schiller Institute Inc.), France (Institut Schiller), Denmark (Schiller Instituttet) and 
T Sweden (Schiller Institutet → p. 536).937 The French website mentions a ‘presence’ in more 
I
O than 30 countries, although the exact nature of  this presence is not specified.
N One of  the Institute’s main projects is based on the idea of  a “Eurasian Landbridge”938 
S that would link the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean via three major communication 

corridors: a northern route via the Trans-Siberian Railway, a central route through Ukraine, 
Russia, Kazakhstan and China, and a southern route via Turkey, Iran and Central Asia to 
China. These routes were imagined as a way to bring an end to age-old conflicts through 
broadly beneficial Euro-Asian cooperation and economic development.939 Through this 
project, LaRouche aspired to a fairer global economic order that would replace failing

economic and maritime routes. T
I

Since 2013, there has been a gradual convergence between LaRouche and the O
N

Schiller Institute’s ideas on the one hand and the Chinese objectives on the other. 
In an interview for Xinhua, Helga Zepp-LaRouche’s husband, Lyndon LaRouche, stated 
that China was a key nation in the advent of  a new world economic order.940 Not long C
afterwards, Helga Zepp-LaRouche published a paper called “New Economic Order Begins O
with New Silk Road.” Therein she invited the UN to cooperate and stressed the role that N
Xi Jinping’s New Silk Road project could play in the organization of  a new world order C

E
capable of  taking into account ‘non-aligned’ countries. P

As a result of  the LaRouches’ positions, the head of  the Schiller Institute became a T
favorite with Chinese media. For instance, she was invited to Yan Rui’s famous TV how S
“Dialogue” on China’s national CCTV channel, which introduced her the “New Silk Road 
Lady” and a founder of  the “Eurasian Landbridge” project.941 Mrs. Zepp-LaRouche was 
also interviewed on China Radio International’s “People in the Know” program. During 
the interview, she asserted that the New Silk Road could pave the way for a new credit sys-
tem between sovereign nations to replace our “unjust financial system.”942 A

In September 2014, Helga Zepp-LaRouche participated in several conferences on the 

Silk Roads in China. At an event organized by China Investment Magazine (中国投资),943 
Helga Zepp-LaRouche was introduced by Colonel Bao Shixiu (鲍世修), a former profes-
sor at the PLA Academy of  Military Science (中国军事科学院), translator of  Russian and 
specialist in military theory.944 In fact, Bao Shixiu had previously participated in a conference

C motif, detailed at the founding of  the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building 
T
I Measures in Asia (CICA): “security problems in Asia should be solved by Asians them-
O
N selves. Outsiders should consciously exit the game.”945 

Gradually, the common positions turned into a 
common strategy. Both Mrs. Zepp-LaRouche’s state-

C ments in Chinese media and the participation of  Chinese 
O intellectuals in events organized by the Schiller Institute 
N have gradually built a positive image of  China. They 
C
E have given way to an increased coordination between 
P the two actors and an unremitting support of  the 
T Schiller Institute to China’s influence operations. 
S This coordination crystallized on December 4, 2019 

when CGTN announced the creation of  CGTN Think 
Tank, a network of  foreign think tanks and institutions 
the Schiller Institute immediately joined (→ p. 309).946 
According to Zheng Bijian (郑必坚),947 president of  

A
C the China Institute for Innovation and Development 
T Strategy (中国科学院国家创新与发展战略研究会), CGTN Think Tank could “play an 
O outstanding role in the process of  deepening and expanding the ‘understanding of  China and 
R the world.’”948 At this event, Helga Zepp-LaRouche addressed the first panel of  experts as a 
S founding member of  the project. She stressed the need to extend the Eurasian Landbridge 

concept worldwide (World Landbridge), which would make it possible to replace outdated 
institutions such as NATO.949

The day after the summit, Zepp-LaRouche was invited on China Radio International’s 
“World Today” program. She asserted that the model of  Chinese development for eradi-

A cating poverty created a new paradigm that contrasted with the Western neo-liberal model, 
C
T which was doomed to fail.950 
I The positions adopted by the Schiller Institute and its president, on social networks and 
O in their publications, illustrate the converging strategies and the unfailing support given by 
N
S the think tank to the dissemination of  the Party’s narratives. All the Institute’s publications 

have unfailingly praised the projects included in the Silk Roads. To this end, the Institute 
does not hesitate to appropriate the Party’s narratives. The Schiller Institute’s publication 
The New Silk Road becomes the World Landbridge: A Shared future for humanity illustrates this by 
taking up the slogan of  the community of  common destiny.951

Mrs. Zepp-LaRouche is also committed to defending China against its Western 
critics. This posture was evident during the Covid-19 crisis, which led Zepp-LaRouche 
to cross swords with China’s critics.952 Her criticisms were notably aimed at the United 
Kingdom, presented as the cornerstone of  the opposition to China. Zepp-LaRouche A
described London as resisting dialogue with China and set a somewhat fallacious historical C
continuity between the Opium Wars and Covid-19. T

N Think tanks such as the Schiller Institute are therefore essential nodes in the export 
S and dissemination of  Chinese narratives, which aim above all to build a positive image 

of  China. Additionally, as per the examples above, they can also act as intermediaries exert-
ing a certain pressure on Beijing’s critics. In this case, with the Schiller Institute, Beijing 
can count on the entire LaRouche movement, which has many branches around the 
world. In Australia, for example, the Australian Citizens Party, a political party affiliated with 
the LaRouche movement, regularly attacks CCP critics – to the delight of  Chinese authori-

C ties and media.954 Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian praised those “very well-written 
A articles,” a comment echoed by the Chinese embassy in Australia.955

2. Publishers

Chinese narratives, such as the representation of  China as a benevolent power, are not A
C

solely supported by think tanks and foundations but also by actors in the publishing indus- T
try. In France, the La Route de la Soie publishing house is an interesting case of  rela- O
tively advanced cooperation with China. R

S

a. The example of  La Route de la Soie – Editions (The Silk Road Editions, France)
The publishing house La Route de la Soie was created in 2017 by Sonia Bressler, 

a former journalist who holds a PhD in philosophy and has created a communication and 
strategy consulting firm (Bressler Conseil956). She justified her decision to open a publishing 

A
house by the partiality of  the publishing sector in France, which presumably systemati- C
cally rejects Chinese or Iranian manuscripts.957 She also expressed her admiration for “Xi T
Jingping’s (sic) project One Belt One Road, that I find absolutely gigantic, and which is eco- I
nomical, structured and, to my mind, represents an axis that should be developed to pacify O

N
the world”958 – hence the name she gave to the company. S

Sonia Bressler visited China for the first time in 2005, arriving in train from Moscow 
and she ultimately visited the country six times between 2005 and 2019; it allowed her to 
“see the progress made in the social development of  China,” according to Xinhua, in one

on the left of  the French political spectrum: a former CGT trade unionist,995 still host for 
a militant radio created by the CGT996; the former literary referent at ATTAC (an alterglo-
balization organization);997 he is a “long-time personal friend” of  Jean-Luc Mélenchon, 
leader of  the political party La France Insoumise, whom he publicly supported in previous 
elections and who prefaced two of  his books.998 Vivas has been an administrator of  the 
website of  “alternative news” Le Grand Soir A

,999 which “for many years has made itself  C
known with readily conspiratorial content, emanating either from its own editorial staff  or T
from notoriously conspiratorial friendly websites such as Réseau Voltaire, Mondialisation. I

he does not hide his sympathy for the Bolivarian revolution) and China.

Maxime Vivas with the “red shirts” in a demonstration in Caracas, June 2, 2007 (image published by Jean-Luc Mélenchon on 
his blog1001). Vivas is the author of  a novel titled Rouges Les Collines de Caracas (Arcane, 2015) which he notably presented and 

autographed at the stand of  the Bolivarian Alliance at the “Fête de l’Huma” in September 2015.1002

Vivas has defended Beijing since the late 2000s by going after its adversaries: first, at 
A the end of  2007, in a book attacking RSF (La face cachée de Reporters sans frontières: de la CIA 
C aux faucons du Pentagone),1003 precisely when the NGO was campaigning to denounce human 
T rights violations in China ahead of  the 2008 Beijing Olympics.1004 When the media spoke 
O
R about it in 2008, the author was “on vacation in China.”1005 
S In 2010, he travelled to Tibet, in a trip admittedly “organized by the Chinese authorities. ‘We 

could even say ‘supervised’”; he reported on it in an article untitled “Choses vues au Tibet,”1006 
a daring reference to Victor Hugo. The following year, he published a book attacking the Dalai 
Lama (Pas si zen: la face cachée du dalaï-lama),1007 which was abundantly relayed by Chinese media, 
including some presenting Vivas as a “researcher on Tibet”.1008 Then, in 2015, in an interview 

A with Xinhua, he revealed that he had finished “a new book on China in which I examine the 
C issue of  laicity in Tibet.” The book was untitled Tibet: Quelques vérités à ne pas dire aux libres censeurs, 
T aux nostalgiques de la théocratie safran et aux ennemis de la laïcité, and he hoped “first to publish it […] in 
I China. He wanted, as he explained, to show Chinese readers that they have friends in France.”1009 
O
N That said, the book was neither published, in France or in China. 
S Then, he turned to the Uyghur issue, by travelling to Xinjiang twice, in 2016 and 

2018, during trips organized by the Chinese authorities. The second time, he was invited 
by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (新疆生产建设兵团, also called

U

in the implementation of  a complete program of  surveillance, detention, and indoctrina- C

tion in Xinjiang, which target the Uyghurs, and members of  other ethnic minorities.” The T
I

organization’s first secretary was sanctioned by U.S. authorities in July 2020 for his role in O
N

“grave human rights violations.”1011 These supervised trips provided the content of  the 
book published by La Route de la Soie. From the perspective of  Chinese authorities, and 
of  their trolls on social networks, they provided the author with his legitimacy – because he C
went to see it “there for himself.” O

Once his manuscript was completed, Vivas submitted it to nine “leftist” publishing N
houses, to no avail. He then turned to Sonia Bressler, who “accepted it even before C

E
reading it.”1012 By August 2020, and even though the book had yet to be published, P
Maxime Vivas’ remarks on Uyghurs were already relayed by the Chinese embassy T
in France, which later promoted the book upon its release, as did Chinese state media and S
other Chinese diplomatic social media accounts (see images below). The Minister of  Foreign 
Affairs Wang Yi himself  promoted the book during a press conference, noting that Vivas 
“[based] on his two trips to the autonomous region, […] tells a real Xinjiang that enjoys 
prosperity and stability.”1013 The Ministry’s spokesperson also “[gave] him a thumbs-up for 
his courage to reveal the truth and hope[d] more people will cheer him on”1014. Despite this A

C
Chinese media hype, four months after its release only a few hundred copies of  the books T
had been sold in France.1015 From Beijing’s point of  view, this is not an underperformance O
however, since it is propaganda for inernal use: in promoting Vivas’ book, the objective is R

S
not to convince the French but to show, in China, that the Party-State has support abroad.

Maxime Vivas has since co-edited a collective book, La Chine sans œillères (China with- A
out blinkers), published by a communist1023 (or “Marxist” according to the Chinese embassy) C
publishing house that had been hosted by the Chinese ambassador to France. The latter T
is also promoting it on social networks. Both Vivas and Beijing have a vested interest in O

R
diversifying their vectors and therefore in working with other publishing houses. Finally, S
Vivas is also promoting the Chinese vaccine on social networks (below).

T When Maxime Vivas attacks the IRSEM
I
O Reacting to an article in Le Monde announcing the imminent publication of  this report and 
N mentioning him, Maxime Vivas published an article on his website Le Grand Soir entitled “An 

IRSEM report, in the shadow of  a senior US officer. Where it is proven that Le Monde draws 
its articles on China from the NATO swamp.”1024 In this text, at the turn of  which he called 

C Tristan Mendès France a “swine” (crevure), the argument against us is twofold: on the one hand, 
O one of  the two authors of  the report, Jean-Baptiste Jeangène Vilmer, is “a member of  the 
N Academic Advisory Board of  the NATO Defense College” (which is false, he used to be, but 
C not since 2019); on the other hand, an American officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jordan Becker, is 
E among the associated researchers of  IRSEM. And Vivas focuses on him, adding that IRSEM 
P “communicates to Le Monde materials for anti-Chinese articles” (image below). He even makes 
T it the tagline of  his Twitter post, summarizing the IRSEM report as the work of  “a Yankee 
S lieutenant colonel.”

A
C
T
O
R
S The procedure is crude and is a string of  fallacies. First, an ad hominem argument, i.e. at-

tacking the person instead of  the thing (ad rem) being discussed. Instead of  answering on the 
merits (what Le Monde or IRSEM have said), Vivas tries to find a link, whatever it may be, be-
tween the person and the United States and/or NATO – a link that would have, for him, an ex-
planatory value for the positions defended in the report. He had already done it with Antoine 
Bondaz (“dubbed by the State Department” because he participated in an exchange program 

A a few years earlier1025); he did it again here. Furthermore, he uses a “bad company fallacy,” 
C or “dishonor by association,” because the link with the United States and/or NATO is – at 
T least in Vivas’ mind – discrediting. The detour via the NATO Defense College or an American 
I associate researcher is also a diversion since it has no bearing on the discussion (on Chinese 
O influence operations or on the role of  Maxime Vivas in Chinese influence in France). Last but 
N not least, there is a causal fallacy since Vivas deduces from a simple correlation (the presence 
S of  an American researcher in the team) a causal link (which supposedly explains that IRSEM 

“communicates to Le Monde materials for anti-Chinese articles”), without any proof  of  course, 
by the sole work of  his imagination, in a construction that may seem conspiratorial.
To answer on the merits, Jordan Becker is not only an American soldier, he is first and fore-
most a researcher, holding a Ph.D. in political economy, regularly publishing in reputable 
scientific journals and it is in this capacity that he is “associated” with IRSEM, without being 
part of  the resident team (associate researchers are not physically present at IRSEM, in this 
case Jordan Becker lives and works in the United States). His expertise is in transatlantic se-

C curity and defense economy, not in China or influence operations. He was obviously never 
A involved, in any way, in the preparation of  this report. He was not even aware of  it until 
S its publication. And the authors did not need Americans to find “materials” that the Party-
E State itself, and its relays of  influence throughout the world, leave lying around freely, as the 

sources of  this report show.
Finally, IRSEM has a team of  about thirty resident and thirty associate researchers. Among 
these sixty or so names, Vivas only named the sole American. But there is also on the team 
(as resident, which should be worse) a researcher from the Singapore Ministry of  Defense,

C But Antoine Bondaz also did the Chinese equivalent in 2016, which neutralizes Vivas’ fallacious argument that should 
L logically infer that Bondaz is just as much “sold out to China” as the interested party points out to him (tweet from @

and, in the past four years, a German researcher from a think tank funded by the Federal D
Chancellery. The fact that in this diversity the U.S. associate researcher is chosen and the rest U

C
not even considered as potential explanatory factor is another fallacy of  incomplete evi- T
dence or “cherry-picking.” If  one follows Vivas’ logic, there would actually be more reason I
to believe that the report was influenced or fed by Singaporean or German authorities than by O

N
U.S. authorities. 
This fallacious reasoning would not deserve a detailed response if  we had not anticipated that 
this U.S./NATO card would be played extensively to try to discredit the authors and/
or the IRSEM, among other ad hominem attacks which the Party and its trolls have now cus- C
tomarily used against those who dare criticize its practices. O

Sonia Bressler’s cooperation with the CCP has also resulted in the birth of  a French- P
T

language journal, Dialogue Chine-France, published by the magazine La Chine au présent S
(China Today). There are, in fact, two magazines with the same title, both meant to build “a 
bridge between the Chinese and French populations.”1026 A digital journal was launched in 
March 2020,1027 while a monthly printed journal has been published “in cooperation with 
La Route de la Soie”1028 since its first issue in July 2020. We can find in these pages contri-
butions from several individuals mentioned above. This initiative, launched in the middle of  A
the Covid-19 pandemic, can be interpreted as tied to Beijing’s efforts to muscle its influence C

in Europe precisely when its image was hit. O

D The monthly magazine, printed at approximately 2,000 copies, is sold for 3 euros and 
U
C widely distributed free of  charge to influencers, including think tanks and ministers’ offices, 
T
I which did not fail to attract attention.1029 The link with the CCP is obvious since Dialogue 
O
N Chine-France is published by La Chine au présent, which is none other than the 

French version of  the magazine China Today. The latter is published by the China 
International Publishing Group (CIPG), an organization under the CCP’s Central 

C Propaganda Department (→ p. 288). The La Route de la Soie publishing house assumes 
O this link since it indicated on its website that it “co-produced” this magazine with “La Chine 
N au présent (part of  China International Publishing Group).” Besides, Sonia Bressler is a 
C
E member of  both their editorial board and committee of  experts,1030 along with Wang Shuo, 
P deputy director of  the European Department of  the CICIR, the MSS think tank (→ p. 126), 
T Cui Hongjian, director of  the Department of  European Studies at the China Institute 
S of  International Studies (CIIS), the think tank of  the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, and 

Christian Mestre, honorary dean of  the Faculty of  Law, Political Science and Management 
at the University of  Strasbourg (→ p. 409). 

From Beijing’s point of  view, this collaboration with a French publishing house is use-
ful not only because it brings local relays but also, and above all, to “‘blur the tracks’ as 

A
C to the real origin of  this magazine financed by the Chinese Communist Party” as 
T Antoine Bondaz explained.1031 For the same reasons, this monthly magazine tries to inte-
O grate French and international authors who are not necessarily stamped “friends of  China.” 
R For instance, the 6th issue (December 2020) included an article by the mayor of  Brest, 
S François Cuillandre, which he did not write: it “was directly commissioned by the munici-

pality of  Qingdao,” Brest’s twin city.1032

media on China. I started this work for which I have set aside all the negative expressions O
N

they constantly read.”1034 Covid-19 provided her with a perfect opportunity. On April 23,

Therein, she denounced the criticisms formulated against China in the context of  the A
epidemic, which she assimilated to a form of  racism or, at the very least, to unfounded C
stereotypes. She also referred to it as a form of  cynicism which entailed accusing China to T
divert the attention of  public opinion. Her paper also tried to demonstrate that China had I

O
managed the crisis well, which was one of  the Party’s narratives – namely, that China showed N
incredible generosity and, above all, that there was no evidence that the virus originated in S
China – which was a subtle way of  giving credence to the thesis of  an American ori-
gins of  the virus (→ p. 589).

U VIII. Culture
C
T
I Chinese influence on culture is twofold: influence on the production and export of  cul-
O
N tural products to seduce foreign publics; and influence exerted on foreign cultural produc-

tions to make them conform to the Party’s interests.

C
O A. The production and export of  cultural products
N
C “Culture is a country and nation’s soul,” Xi Jinping said in his speech to the 19th CCP 
E
P National Congress: “Our country will thrive only if  our culture thrives, and our nation will 
T be strong only if  our culture is strong.” Therefore, he called for the “develop[ment of] a 
S socialist culture” to “add new luster to Chinese culture” and “to develop a great socialist 

culture in China.”1048 Three five-year plans have successively delineated China’s strategy for 
cultural development since 2006.1049 This strategy supports and promotes the production 
and export of  Chinese cultural products abroad. 

Cultural products, such as movies and TV series, music, and books, are powerful 
A
C vectors of  influence if  they manage to penetrate foreign markets and adjust to consumers’ 
T tastes who do not necessarily share the same cultural codes. Today, movies and TV series 
O are undoubtedly the most powerful and attractive among these vectors. In 2017, 
R China’s Ministry of  Commerce announced $90 billion worth of  exported cultural prod-
S ucts that year, including more than $400 million for cinema and other television products, 

based on data by the National Radio and Television Administration.1050 Chinese TV series 
have always been particularly successful in Asia,1051 and in Southeast Asia mostly. However, 
China wants to diversify and export its television products to other markets in Africa, the 
Middle East, Europe, and in North America. In 2017, China Daily reported that China 

A had translated more than 1,600 films and television products into 36 foreign languages, 
C
T including English, French, Russian, and Arabic. These were being broadcast in about 100 
I countries.1052 
O Several organizations are key in selling cultural products abroad. For example, 
N China International Television Corporation (CITVC, 中国国际电视总公司) is a 
S

subsidiary of  China Media Group (CMG) founded in 1984 to promote Chinese televi-
sion products abroad. It has established partnerships with foreign channels to broadcast 
Chinese programs, such as the “China Hour” broadcast on the Portuguese channel Porto 
Canal since 2018, the first Chinese program on a Southern European channel.1053 The 
China Radio, Film and Television Programs Exchanging Center (CHNPEC), one of  the 
main organizations marketing and promoting Chinese films and TV series worldwide, is

1. TV shows O
R

Chinese TV shows can be broadly categorized into three genres, depending on the time S

period of  the plot: “costume” or “traditional” series (古装剧), whose story takes place 
– more or less realistically – in ancient or imperial China; series that have the – often 
hagiographic – history of  the CCP as a backdrop; and “realistic” or “modern” series that 
take place in the present-day China. Several “traditional” shows have been met with daz-
zling success abroad, such as Story of  Yanxi Palace (延禧攻略), Empresses in the Palace (甄嬛 A
传), Nirvana in Fire (琅琊榜), and Princess Agents (楚乔传).1059 This type of  series seduces C

T
with elegant costumes and sets, and it feeds the image of  a rich, refined and powerful past I
Chinese civilization. This image reinforces the legitimacy of  the Chinese narrative accord- O
ing to which the emergence (or rather the re-emergence) of  China is a natural fact, as the N

country is just regaining the status of  power it had enjoyed before Westerners inflicted “a S

Century of  Humiliation” on it (百年耻辱). 
Despite some domestic successes, series and films on the Party’s history, which are always 

challenging to evaluate since their broadcast is often imposed on TV channels, are difficult 
to export. This category is best illustrated by Diplomatic Situation (外交风云),1060 a 48-epi-

“Modern” series, such as Ode to Joy (欢乐颂) or Stay with Me (放弃我, 抓紧我) – which 
have been very successful abroad – convey another image that Chinese authorities are 

A just as eager to disseminate. Whatever the plot, these stories, which take today’s society 
C as their backdrop, show an economically developed, modernized and prosperous China 
T
O – an image that the Party welcomes because it sees itself  as the architect of  this modern 
R China. More importantly, these series are seen as a powerful vehicle to “more adequately 
S tell” China’s history and to “better understand” today’s China as the victim of  many 

prejudices.

2. Movies

A Other cinematographic achivements defend the coun-
C try more straightforwardly. Operation Red Sea (红 海
T 行动) and the Wolf  Warrior series (战狼) are patri-
I
O otic action films that have been very successful upon 
N their release, both at home and abroad. The first, 
S released for the 90th anniversary of  the PLA’s creation, 

and concurrently to the 19th CCP Congress, honored 
the PLA naval forces who were tasked with evacuating 
Chinese nationals stranded in the midst of  the civil war 
in Yemen. Wolf  Warrior – the second opus was 
China’s biggest box-office success (it brought $870 

C million) – follows the adventures of  a former Special 
A Forces member who goes to Africa to protect his fel-
S
E low countrymen in danger. Movies like these defend 

the image of  a responsible China, a “mother coun-
try” ready to make any sacrifice to protect its citi-

zens in danger, a message that undoubtedly primarily targets a domestic audience (to 
strengthen its sense of  national pride and confidence in the ruling authorities). These mov-

C ies also show (off) the projection and combat capabilities of  the PLA, the talents and 
O
N the sense of  honor of  the Chinese military. They convey an image that seeks to impress and

seduce foreign audiences in the same way that many Hollywood action films tend to rein- D
U

force the attractiveness of  U.S. armed forces. C

The science fiction movie Wandering Earth (流浪地球) is another example: in a future T
I

world where humanity is facing imminent extinction and in which not a single American O
N

is represented, a group of  Chinese dares to fight to the end and manages to revive hope, 
unify the remaining people, and thus to save humanity. The message is forceful and cor-
responds to a PRC narrative: China cares about the well-being of  others and, in this sense, C
offers an alternative to the American way. O

The dissemination of  these cultural products abroad – N
when they manage to make room for themselves and C

E
take hold in the market – makes it possible to make P
Chinese culture, history, language and civilization T
known and loved and they serve as a powerful vehicle S
to defend a specific image of  China: powerful, rich, 
developed, refined and caring.

3. Video games A
C
T

China also exerts a cultural influence through video games, an industry where it is a O
major player. In 2018, four of  the top five global companies in the sector were Chinese, R
with Tencent leading the way. The Chinese market is the world’s second-largest market S

behind the United States and was estimated to be worth $92 million in 2020.1061 Video 
games are one of  the very first cultural goods exported by China and, therefore, a sig-
nificant vector of  influence. They offer cultural worlds that are more easily adaptable 
to the expectations of  the global market than cinema and even more so than literature. 
They allow China to export and make known typically Chinese characters or heroes A
such as the monkey Sun Wukong from the Journey to the West. The Chinese market is C

undergoing two important developments that could eventually facilitate the develop- T
I

ment of  national companies on the international market: the expansion of  games on O
cell phones and on the cloud. The first, known as mini-games, are mainly the work of  N
Tencent, which offers them on its social network WeChat and on QQ. Cloud games S

offer streaming access without the need for downloads, and Tencent is also a leader in 
this market. 

In recent years, Chinese video game companies have embarked on a very aggressive 
strategy of  acquiring foreign companies. Tencent, for example, now owns the U.S. 
company Riot Games (Legends of  Runeterra), the Finnish company Supercell (Clash of  Clans) 
or the New Zealand company Grinding Gear Games (Path of  Exile). The Chinese company C

A
also owns 40% of  the capital of  Epic Games, the developer of  Fortnite. In France, Tencent S
holds a 5% stake in Ubisoft, the national leader in the sector. China’s penetration of  this E
market increases its influence and its ability to control anti-Chinese narratives or positions 
contrary to its interests. However, video games are less readily associated with Chinese cul-
ture and are, therefore, only a secondary vector of  seduction for Beijing. On the other hand, 
it constitutes an excellent tool for disinformation.

O
N

China’s strategy in the cultural sector and particularly in the production of  cultural 
goods is often summarized by the expression “borrowing a boat out to sea” (借船出海). 

C This Chengyu means in common parlance: “to benefit from someone’s help” or “to bor-
O row someone else’s resources to achieve one’s own goals.” And, as the journalist Bethany 
N Allen-Ebrahimian puts it, “Hollywood is the world’s largest and most powerful boat,”1062 
C in the sense that it is arguably the most influential artistic and cultural medium. 
E
P In a particularly comprehensive report on the subject, the NGO PEN America, which 
T defends freedom of  expression in the country and around the world, shows how, in order 
S not to upset Beijing and maintain an access to the gigantic Chinese market, “[as] 

U.S. film studios compete for the opportunity to access Chinese audiences, many 
are making difficult and troubling compromises on free expression: changing the 
content of  films intended for international – including American audiences; engaging 
in self-censorship; agreeing to provide a censored version of  a movie for screening in 

A China; and in some instances directly inviting Chinese government censors onto their 
C
T film sets […].”1063

O This growing acceptance of  Chinese censorship, PEN America points out, is 
R all the more disturbing because, while regularly producing “patriotic” films that con-
S tribute significantly to American soft power, Hollywood does not hesitate to chip away 

at the U.S. political life and is seen as being out of  Washington’s control – but not of  
Beijing’s. 

The problem is even more acute today as the Chinese film market is on its way to 
become the world’s largest market. China’s quarterly box office revenues exceeded those 

A of  the United States for the first time in the first quarter of  2018 and were expected to 
C
T surpass yearly U.S. revenues in 2020, becoming the world’s largest market, according to 
I estimates made prior to the Covid-19 pandemic that hit the film industry hard around the 
O world. Even though China became the world’s first market to regain its box office in August 
N 2020,1064 the latest estimates indicated that the Chinese market will have to wait a few more 
S

years before outperforming the U.S. market.1065 In any case, a trend is observable, and 
because of  its size, the Chinese market has become unavoidable for major American 
studios. In recent years, blockbusters such as Avengers: Endgame (2019), Spider-Man: Far from 
Home (2019), and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) generated more money in 
China than in the U.S.1066

Chinese investments in Hollywood films have also grown considerably in recent 
C
A years: in the top 100 most profitable films worldwide, China contributed to financing 12 
S Hollywood films in 17 years (between 1997 and 2013), and 41 in just 5 years (between 2014

and 2018).1067 The offensive is blatant, and these Chinese investments give Beijing consid- D
U

erable leverage over the U.S. studios that benefit from them. C

This dependence is not reciprocal: while Hollywood needs China more and more, T
I

China needs Hollywood less and less, not only because the technical progress made by O
N

the Chinese film industry in recent years allows for more Chinese productions to satisfy 
their audiences’ thirst for blockbusters, but also because the “Cold War” with the United 
States makes Chinese authorities and its public more hostile to U.S. productions. Whereas C
Hollywood productions dominated the top 10 biggest hits in China before 2018, in 2020, O
only one did, the other spots being taken by Chinese and Hong Kong films.1068 As the N
Chinese market becomes increasingly important but also competitive, American C

E
studios are encouraged to double down on their efforts to please Beijing. P

T
a. Access to the Chinese market S

There are three ways to access the Chinese market. The first is quota: according to 
a Sino-American agreement of  2012, American films have 34 spots per year on the Chinese 
market. These coveted seats are, in fact, almost exclusively occupied by blockbusters. For 
some, this ceiling is more problematic than content censorship: the limited number of  A
American films authorized in China “is the real censorship that is going on. That C
is the real limit on [freedom of] expression,” explained a Hollywood writer.1069 The deci- T

O
sion-making process – the acceptance or rejection of  a film – is vague. And this opacity R
contributes to self-censorship because, as the limits of  what is acceptable are blurred, S
studios take as few risks as possible to maximize their chances. 

The second way to distribute a film in China is the fixed fee or buy-out model, 
whereby the foreign studio agrees to transfer all profits made in China to the Chinese 
distributor in exchange for a flat fee. Thirty to forty films a year enter the Chinese market 
this way, primarily independent films (blockbusters occupying most of  the quota spots), to A
which censorship is also applied. C

The third way, which is increasingly used, is the co-production of  a foreign movie T
with a Chinese studio. It has several advantages, as the films in question are not consid- I

O
ered foreign (e.g., they are not affected by the periods during the year when Beijing prohibits N
the screening of  foreign films to promote its domestic film industry).1070 However, co-pro- S
duction is also the formula that allows Beijing to exert the most significant influence 
on content, with the Chinese partner playing an intermediary role with the censors: they 
are present from the beginning and at each stage of  the film’s creation. Besides, the China 
Film Coproduction Corporation (CFCC), a division of  CFGC, sets artistic limitations: at 
least one-third of  the financial investment and casting must be Chinese, and at least one 
scene must be shot in China. For example, when a Chinese production company funded C
40% of  Looper (2012), reclassifying the film as a co-production, the character played by A
Bruce Willis, who was to divide his time between Paris and Kansas, finally split it between S

E
Paris and Shanghai, and was united with a Chinese woman played by Xu Qing.1071 Similarly, 
in the book on which the film The Meg (2018) was based, the events took place in Hawaii,

U
C the scientists who were Japanese in the book became Chinese. 
T
I Co-productions are sometimes more or less hidden. For example, China: Times of  
O
N Xi, a three-episode documentary series aired on Discovery Channel in October 2017, was 

presented as “an independent television production” when, in fact, it was the brainchild of  
“a three-year content coproduction deal inked in March 2015 between Discovery Networks 

C Asia-Pacific and China Intercontinental Communications Centre (CICC), a company oper-
O ated by the State Council Information Office (CSIO) – the Chinese government organ shar-
N ing an address with the Central Propaganda Department’s Office of  Foreign Propaganda 
C
E (OFP).”1072 
P PEN America pointed out that what appears to be a protectionist measure on the outset 
T has another dimension in an authoritarian state where production companies are almost all 
S state-owned or controlled in some way by the state, where the actors are those authorized 

by the Party, and where the authorities decide which scenes should be shot in China, where 
and how, to portray only “a sanitized image of  China.”1073 

Furthermore, co-productions must also comply with a set of  rules (Provisions on the 
Administration of  Sino-Foreign Cooperative Production of  Films, 2004). Article 6(a), for example, 

A
C obliges co-productions to “be in accord with the Constitution, laws, regulations and the 
T relevant provisions of  China,” to “respect the customs, religions, beliefs and living habits 
O of  all ethnic groups in China”, to “facilitate the propagation of  the refined indigenous 
R culture and traditions of  China” and “the social stability of  China” (social stability which, 
S PEN America noted, is one of  the arguments used against dissidents or ethnic minorities, 

especially the Uyghurs). Furthermore, Article 16 states that the film can only be screened 
“inside or outside China” after it has passed the government’s “examination,” or censorship, 
which occurs at any time, from the preliminary examination of  the script to the verification 
of  the finished film, – and is conducted by the CCP’s Central Propaganda Department. 

A Government censors were present on the Chinese campus of  DreamWorks Animation 
C
T to oversee the creation of  Kung Fu Panda III (2016) for instance, a Chinese-American joint 
I production (China Film Group, DreamWorks Animation and Oriental DreamWorks).1074

S b. Blacklists

The turning point came in 1997, with the successive release of  Kundun, on the youth 
of  the Dalai Lama; Seven Years in Tibet, which showed, among other things, the invasion 
of  Tibet by China; and Red Corner, the story of  an American lawyer wrongly accused of  
murder in China. Not only did Beijing refuse to authorize their release in China, but their 
directors and main actors were allegedly blacklisted and the production companies involved 

C prevented from working in China for five years.1075 Although China’s market was modest 
A in size at the time, comparable to Peru’s, Hollywood immediately got the message. Michael 
S
E Eisner, the then-CEO of  Disney, which had produced Kundun, met with Chinese Prime 

Minister Zhu Rongji in October 1998 in Beijing, apologized, and promised that it would

not happen again.1076 Indeed, the U.S. studios gradually conformed to the expectations of  D
U

the Chinese government afterward. C

The blacklistings of  producers, directors, or actors deemed hostile to China are T
I

of  varying intensity: they may be limited to a warning; one or more visa refusals; or O
N

last for decades. Brad Pitt, who was (presumably) blacklisted for acting in Seven Years in 
Tibet, was able to return to China in 2014 solely, while the director Jean-Jacques Annaud was 
asked as early as 2009 to direct a Franco-Chinese co-production. On this occasion, in a let- C
ter in Chinese published on Weibo, which is now deleted but preserved and reproduced by O
PEN America, Annaud issued an apology. He expressed his “deep regret” for the negative N
impact that Seven Years in Tibet had in China and declared that he had “never participated in C

E
any organization or association related to Tibet.” Furthermore, he had “never supported P
Tibetan independence, nor […] had personal contact with the Dalai Lama, let alone been T
his friend.”1077 After making amends in 2009, Annaud made up for his past decision by S
making a film co-produced by a Chinese company (The Last Wolf, 2015). He also signed 
“a strategic partnership agreement with China for two films in the next three years,”1078 
also becoming a member of  the Strategic Committee of  the France China Foundation 
(→ p. 268)1079 (and his biography on their website, which cited many of  his films, still omits 
to mention Seven Years in Tibet).1080 A

T

c. Cut or modify to suit O
R

One of  Beijing’s objectives is to censor content perceived as threatening, particularly the S
five “poisons” (Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners, pro-democracy activists and 
Taiwanese independence supporters) but also, more broadly, anything that could question 
the CCP’s authority.

The simplest censorship is removing a scene, a shot or a line of  dialogue following 
a demand by Chinese authorities as a condition to access to the Chinese market. A
Thus, in Pirates of  the Caribbean 3 (2007), half  of  the appearances of  Captain Sao Feng, C
played by the Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-Fat, were suppressed in a completely assumed T
manner (according to Xinhua), as Beijing considered them to be “vilifying and defacing the I

O
Chinese.”1081 Similarly, the Chinese version of  Men In Black 3 (2012) is 13 minutes shorter N
than the original one: among the deleted scenes are references to Internet censorship by the S
Chinese government – an ironic and self-defeating censorship, since it confirms what they 
intended to conceal – but also the scene of  a fight in Chinatown. 

Hollywood studios also produced a Chinese version of  Mission Impossible III (2006) with-
out the scene in which Ethan Hunt kills a Chinese henchman and without a shot showing 
tattered underwear hanging from the clothesline of  a Shanghai apartment; or a Chinese 
version of  the James Bond movie Skyfall (2012) without the scene during which a Chinese C
security guard is killed and without lines of  dialogue referring to prostitution and torture by A
the police. Same-sex kissing was also removed from the films Cloud Atlas (2013), Star Trek S

O
D Beyond (2016) and Alien: Covenant (2017).1082 Of  course, PEN America noted that China is 
U
C not the only country in the world to censor films. However, the size of  its market gives it 
T
I unparalleled leverage over Hollywood: while other states cut foreign films themselves, 
O
N after their initial release, sometimes in an artisanal way, and without informing the 

producers, Beijing can force U.S. studios to produce an altered version of  their film, 
i.e. to do “the dirty work for them,” which also has the advantage of  concealing censor-

C ship.1083 
O U.S. studios have an interest in internalizing the constraint because external and 
N post facto censorship can cost them time and money: time for the Chinese censors to 
C
E evaluate the film once it is made, to ask for the withdrawal or the modification of  certain 
P scenes, which sometimes have to be entirely re-shot. All of  this has a cost – and a delayed 
T Chinese release may incur additional costs if  it comes after the U.S. release and requires 
S to reschedule the planned communication plan. Therefore, U.S. studios had adopted 

internal and ex-ante censorship, i.e., self-censorship, producing from the outset the 
most irreproachable film possible, being complacent toward Beijing to maximize 
their chances of  quickly obtaining an imprimatur from Chinese authorities. Meanwhile, and 
to know in advance what Beijing’s red lines could be, the studios call on consultants, open 

A
C informal channels of  communication with Chinese authorities, and use their Chinese part-
T ners – their Chinese distributor or instance – as “cultural intermediaries between Hollywood 
O and the censors.”1084 Throughout filmmaking (at the script, casting, shooting, production 
R stages), they hope to anticipate and avoid potential irritants, hence ensuring that the film 
S remains within the limits of  what is acceptable to Beijing.

The examples of  censorship cited above deal with Chinese versions that exist alongside 
the original version. In some cases, however, self-censorship implies modifying the 
original version, as shown by several examples involving Sony. The best-known is the film 
Red Dawn (2012), which was supposed to tell the story of  a group of  Americans resisting 

A a Chinese occupation of  the United States. That was the plan, and that is what the studio 
C
T filmed. However, after the filming, the Chinese soldiers were replaced by North Korean 
I soldiers “by digitally altering the Chinese flags and insignias into North Korean ones” (see 
O image below).1085 This change occurred after Chinese diplomats made the film’s producers 
N
S aware of  the issue by using a production company with offices in both the US and China 

“as a go-between and mediator.”1086

Similarly, Sony also altered the film Robocop (2014) to downplay the historical ties 
between the US company Omnicorp and the Chinese government in the storyline, while 
acknowledging in an email that this was indeed “censorship” (see below).1087 Also, Sony 
had several scenes removed from the film Pixels (2015), including one in which extra- A
terrestrial beings pierced the Great Wall: they decided to blow up the Taj Mahal instead. C
Justifying the decision to change the original version of  the film, one of  Sony’s execu- T
tives explained in an email that changing the sole Chinese version would have attracted O

R
the attention of  “the press to call us out for this when bloggers invariably compare the S
versions.”1088

S which was China in the original script based on Max Brooks’ 

(2006) eponymous novel (based on the SARS epidemic of  2002-
2004). Dialogues were changed to conceal this Chinese origin, at 
the request of  the production company Paramount in the hope 
of  passing Beijing’s censorship – but this was evidently not 

A enough, since the film was not allowed in China, perhaps for 
C other reasons (Brad Pitt, perhaps still blacklisted, starred in it 
T and also co-produced it).1089 A Tibetan character was replaced by 
I a Celtic one in Dr. Strange (2016) and the Japanese and Taiwanese flags on Tom Cruise’s 
O
N leather jacket were erased from the trailer of  Top Gun: Maverick (2020), a movie partly pro-
S duced by Chinese Tencent Pictures. It did not go unnoticed. 

Hollywood is a spectacular yet not unique case: there are other examples, else-
where in the world, of  films modified to avoid displeasing Beijing. A famous case is 
the decision to cut the contribution of  Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, a figure of  the Chinese 
political opposition, from the German collective movie Berlin, I Love You (2019), a compila-
tion of  ten short films.1090

C “Over time, writers and creators do not even conceive of  ideas, stories, or charac-

we want to share it with you”), but with one condition to cooperation: “[we] want films that O

N
are heavily invested in Chinese culture, not one or two shots […]. We want to see positive C
Chinese images.”1092 E

Some had understood this for a long time, taking several measures such as including P
“good” and empowed Chinese characters (which in itself  is a good thing if  it corrects T

S
racist stereotypes on Asians previously found in Western cinema). But also filming more 
in China and giving China the “right” role in screenplays, that of  a country help-
ing others and even saving the world – the films 2012 (2009), Gravity (2013) and Arrival 
(2016) are examples of  this trend.1093 Additionally, it can mean depicting China as the future 
of  the world: in Looper (2012), a character from the future invites the hero to go to China. A

Correlatively, the same desire to please explains that, for some years now, “there [has C
been] no more Chinese villains in American films.”1094 Americans are sometimes even T
described in a less flattering way than the Chinese: in Transformers: Age of  Extinction (2014), O

R
for example, the bad guys were CIA agents whereas the Chinese government was respon- S
sible, efficient and benevolent, and on the “good” side – which made journalist David S. 
Cohen say that it was “A Splendidly Patriotic Film, If  You Happen To Be Chinese.”1095 As 
a result, the film broke audience and revenue records in China. Another example that put 
a smile on people’s faces was the Megalodon in The Meg (2018), whose action took place in 
China: it seemed to prefer to devour and cut Westerners to pieces, while Chinese characters A
fared better.1096 C

Other cases are more political. In Abominable T
(2019), a Sino-American co-production (Pearl I

O
Studio and DreamWorks Animation), a map of  N
the region that appeared in one scene displayed S
the “nine-dash line,” i.e., Beijing’s territorial 
claim on the South China Sea, a claim contested 
by its neighbors. The UN Permanent Court of  
Arbitration ruled in 2016 on a dispute between 
China and the Philippines that this claim was con-
trary to international law (maritime law in that C
case). This judgment, however, did not prevent A

China from defending the “nine-dash line” by printing it in its passports, on T-shirts worn S
E

by Chinese tourists (→ p. 405) or by slipping it into a Hollywood film. This practice did not 
escape the notice of  its neighbors: Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines were outraged

E #SupportMulan (2019)
P
T In August 2019, when the shooting of  the film Mulan (2020) neared completion, the Chinese-
S American actress Liu Ximeizi (刘茜美子) better known by her stage name Liu Yifei (or Crystal 

Liu) shared on Weibo an image supporting Hong Kong police forces that read: “I support the 
Hong Kong police. You can beat me up now. What a shame for Hong Kong.” She also added 
the hashtag #ISupportHongKongPolice. It was shared more than 65,000 times in less than 24 
hours. 
Supporters of  Hong Kong demonstrators then called for a boycott of  the film using the 

A hashtag #BoycottMulan, after it first emerged on the Hong Kong discussion forum LIHKG 
C and quickly spread around the world. Beijing seized the opportunity to make the film a “loyalty 
T litmus test”1098 by supporting a counter-campaign using #SupportMulan on social networks, 
O going so far as to associate this hashtag with images comparing Hong Kong militants to the 
R terrorist group Islamic State. This coordinated campaign proved “inauthentic” because it used 
S fake accounts and bots – pushing Twitter and Facebook to delete incriminated accounts and 

their associated pages.1099

Disney, which produced the film, was careful not to intervene in this controversy. PEN 
America blamed it for its silence, which “further enabled Beijing to utilize the studio’s movie as 
a tool of  antidemocratic propaganda without pushback. [In conclusion,] the #SupportMulan 
government-backed “movement” goes to show that even if  Hollywood studios aim to make 
their movies as inoffensive as possible – with the definition of  “inoffensive” being highly 

A responsive to what Beijing declares as offensive – the CCP is more than willing to impose a 
C political agenda on these films, leveraging even unanticipated controversies as opportunities to 
T pursue their creative propaganda while pulling studios along for the ride.”1100

Sometimes, studios produce a Chinese ver- D
U

sion that goes even further, adding scenes, C

products, dialogues, and cultural references T
I

for the Chinese audience. For example, the O
N

Chinese version of  Looper (2012) contains several 
scenes shot in Shanghai absent from its interna-
tional version. Another known example is Iron C
Man 3 (2013). The film had benefited from a sig- O

nificant investment by a Beijing production company and had partly been filmed in Beijing. N
Subsequently, Marvel Studios made a Chinese version with several additional scenes to C

E
include Chinese actors (including the actress and singer Fan Bingbing) and Chinese product P
placement: For instance, to revitalize himself, Iron Man drank “Gu Li Duo,” a milky drink T
from the Yili brand (which could be an attempt by the company to regain credibility after a S
health scandal revealed abnormally high levels of  mercury in their mother’s milk). Other 
Chinese brands are also highlighted (TCL, Zoomlion). A group of  Chinese schoolchildren 
and Chinese doctors was also featured trying to save Iron Man’s life. In exchange, the film 
received many “benefits, including an optimal release date, a more permissive government 
attitude toward their film advertisements, and a ‘high degree of  media access in China’ [and] A

C
a promotional segment for the film on CCTV’s annual Chinese New Year gala, a highly T
visible placement that would not have been possible without the Party’s active acquies- O
cence.”1101 R

2. Other cultural sectors

The case of  Hollywood is emblematic of  China’s willingness and ability to influence 
the messages conveyed by cinema. However, other cultural sectors are also victim of  
pressure from Beijing to produce art that is compatible with the CCP’s expecta- A
tions. C

Denying access to the Chinese market is a common practice that targets all T
I

artists critical of  the Party-State, especially those supporting one of  the five “poi- O
sons.” Many musicians, including Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Guns N’ Roses, Elton N
John, Maroon 5, Linkin Park, Björk and Katy Perry, are persona non-grata in China because S

they have supported Tibet, Taiwan, or “Chinese Democracy” (the title of  a Guns N’ 
Roses album).1102 Through other types of  pressure, Beijing hopes to encourage artists 
to alter their works, to stop showing them elsewhere in the world, and even to 
do the work of  Chinese censors. In the following lines, we will only provide a few 
examples of  this practice. 

First, regarding museums. In a context of  “a hardening [in the summer of  2020] of  C
A

the Chinese government’s position against the Mongolian minority,” Beijing put pressure S
on the Museum of  Nantes, which had been planning an exhibition on Genghis Khan E
and the Mongolian empire. To that end, Nantes’ museum had signed a piece loan agree-
ment with the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot (China), but the authorities wanted 
them to remove the words “Genghis Khan,” “empire,” and “Mongolian” from the title. 
Subsequently, the Chinese authorities sent a new contract to the museum in Nantes indi-

D cating “that all the exhibition and catalog texts and the cartographic elements need to be 
U
C sent to China for validation,” as well as a new text introducing the exhibition in which 
T
I “the word Mongol appears on the twelfth page, Genghis Khan completely disappeared, 
O
N and the viewpoint centered on the Han dynasty.”1103 In other words, Beijing wanted to 

make the Mongolian culture disappear and to use this exhibition as propaganda 
for its national narrative. “Inner Mongolia, an autonomous territory, in theory, is very 

C much controlled by the central government, which intends to impose its language and 
O religion, those of  the Hans. [For Beijing,] it is not acceptable that the exhibition puts 
N forward a discourse that breaks with the national narrative,” explained historian Marie-
C
E Dominique Even.1104 Hence, Nantes’ museum decided to postpone its exhibition until 
P 2024 to find pieces from European and American museums instead.
T Second, the video game industry. On October 6, 2019, during the Hearthstone 
S Grandmasters in Taiwan, Ng Wai Chung (吳偉聰), a Hong Kong-based professional 

gamer known as “Blitzchung,” opted for mask similar to those worn by Hong Kong 
protesters. He then declared “Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of  our times.” Shortly 
afterwards, electric power was cut off  at the event. The next day, the Blizzard Company, 
in which Tencent owns 5%, announced that Blitzchung was banned from participat-

A
C ing in its tournaments for one year because he had allegedly offended the public and 
T damaged the company’s image. The Party, in this case, did not necessarily ask Blizzard 
O to sanction the professional gambler. However, the risk of  seeing its market share 
R decline in China led the video game company to anticipate the Party’s demands. 
S In theater also, Chinese diplomats regularly try to ban performances they con-

sider contrary to the CCP’s interests. For example, in 2017, the Chinese embassy put 
pressure on the Royal Danish Theatre to stop a planned performance by the Shen Yun 
dance company, which is linked to Falun Gong. Sometimes the coercion is so inter-
nalized by China’s partners that the Party no longer needs to exert pressure; local 

A authorities volunteer. For example, in 2018, the Royal Court Theatre in London gave 
C
T up performing a play about Tibet, not after being pressured by Chinese authorities, but 
I by the British Council, which noted that performing the play could harm the Royal Court 
O Theatre’s activities in China.1105 It was, therefore, a case of  British self-censorship, so as not 
N
S to risk harming business in China. Notwithstanding, the play was eventually performed in 

2019.1106 Self-censorship – allowing Beijing to win without a fight – is the desired 
end effect.

Finally, in areas where the work needs a medium to be disseminated, such as pictures on 
websites or social network accounts, Beijing frequently succeeds in having the content 
removed by putting pressure on publishers. This is what the photographer Patrick Wack, 

C author of  a photography book on Xinjiang (Dust, André Frère Editions, 2021), was made 
A to understand. Kodak had initially asked him to publish a dozen images on their Instagram 
S account, which they did, with an accompanying text provided by the author that denounced 
E the repression in Xinjiang. Then Kodak suddenly removed them, explaining that “the views

U IX. Information Manipulations
C
T
I According to our analysis from our namesake 2018 report, information manipula-
O
N tions are intentional (thus assuming the intention to harm), clandestine (their victims 

are unaware of  it), and coordinated campaigns of  dissemination of  false or deliberately 
distorted news.1108 They are therefore distinct from propaganda and public diplomacy, 

C which are carried out openly, in an assumed way. These manipulations correspond to 
O what Richard H. Shultz and Roy Godson, in a 1984 study on Soviet “active measures,” 
N
C called covert disinformation, defined as “a non-attributed or falsely attributed communica-
E tion, written or oral, containing intentionally false, incomplete, or misleading informa-
P tion (frequently combined with true information), which seeks to deceive, misinform, 
T
S and/or mislead the target. […] In comparison with overt propaganda, covert disinfor-

mation usually is employed in a selective and discriminatory manner. This technique may 
be advanced through rumors, forgeries, manipulative political actions, but also agents of  
influence, front organizations, and other means.”1109 Today, the tools have changed – the 
Internet and social networks have changed the information environment – but the idea 

A remains the same.
C For Beijing, information manipulation, or secret disinformation, is just one lever 
T among others to infiltrate and coerce, as suggested by the position of  this section 
O
R in this report, but an exceptionally dynamic and well-documented lever. Here, the 
S main actors are the PLA, notably Base 311 (→ p. 89), the CYL (→ p. 72), state media 

– it is well established that, generally speaking, state media aligned with authoritarian 
powers, notably Russia, China, Iran and Turkey, are both producers and amplifiers of  
online information manipulation1110 – but also private intermediaries such as content 
farms.

S The creators of  disinformation have a wide array of  possibilities at their disposal on 

social networks. False accounts or sock puppets are social accounts created under fake 
personas by a person or group of  persons to promote certain ideas or spread false informa-

claim to be) – unlike bots, which are automated accounts (robots), amplifying an activity.1111 
Trolls, for their part, are Internet actors whose objective is to provoke controversy and 

C polemics. When these tools are used massively, it may create the illusion of  authentic and

the practice – disinforming by simulating a spontaneous popular movement – is called D
U

astroturfing, in reference to AstroTurf, a carpet brand imitating grass (and a wordplay C

based on the word grassroots).1112 Almost systematically included in Russian informa- T
I

tional operations,1113 these tactics have been adopted by China, first internally, to O
N

target its population, and then on the international scene.

a. Domestically: A distraction strategy to prevent dissident collective action C
In 2017, an empirical study estimated that “the [Chinese] government fabricates and O

N
posts about 448 million social media comments a year, [whose purpose is] to avoid C
arguing with sceptics of  the party and the government, and not even discuss controversial E
issues. [But rather] to distract the public and change the subject, as most of  these posts P
involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of  the Communist Party, or other T

S
symbols of  the regime”1114. What is commonly referred to as the “50 Cent Army,” or “50 
Cent Party,” because they are presumably paid 50 cents (€0.06) per post – a false rumor1115 
– are more formally known as “Internet commentators” (网络评论员).1116 A 2021 study 
shows that the Party has 2 million paid commentators, directly employed by Cyber Affairs 
Commissions (网络安全和信息化委员会) and Propaganda Bureaus nationwide,1117 along A
with more than 20 million part-time trolls, most of  them students and CYL members.1118 C
The objective is to have as many of  them as possible defend the same discourse so that T

O
genuine network users do not dare express divergent opinions because they would seem to R
be in the minority. Therefore, the goal is to frame the debate or, to use the Chinese govern- S
ment’s terminology, to “guide” (引导) public opinion, i.e., to manipulate it. 

E-mails written in 2023-2014 and leaked from the Zhanggong district Internet Propaganda 
Office, in which these “commentators” reported on their activity, provided the authors of  
this study with a sample of  more than 43,000 comments posted by Internet users identi-
fied as members of  this “50 Cent Party.” King et al. maintained that they searched in vain A
for evidence that some of  these comments had been created automatically by bots. But C
evidence pointed to the conclusion that “each was written by a specific, often identifiable, T
human being under direction from the government.”1119 I

O
They concluded that there was a “strategy of  distraction,” with peaks in the activity N

of  these commentators during events with “collective action potential”, like demon- S
strations or an explosion, but also during vacations, when idle people are more likely to 
mobilize for causes, and before political meetings (strategic periods during which strategic 
distraction is used in conjunction with, and complementary to, redistribution and repres-

D sion measures).1120 In these sensitive periods, Internet commentators are asked to 
U
C “promote unity and stability through positive publicity” and “actively guide public 
T
I opinion.”1121 Approximately 80% of  the posts fall into this category, which the authors call 
O
N cheerleading, i.e. promotion, positive advertising instead of  debate and argumentation.1122 

Contrary to the dominant thesis, which the authors call the “state critique theory” (censor-
ship aimed at suppressing dissent), they defend a theory of  “collective action potential.” 

C Accordingly, censorship aims to prevent collective actions not generated or con-
O trolled by the state, whatever their purpose or, in other words, whether or not this collec-
N tive expression opposes the state or is even political in nature.1123
C
E Another study identified several cases of  mass publications of  comments supported 
P by the Chinese government, including one connected to the G20 summit in Hangzhou 
T in 2016 and another to the explosions in the port of  Tianjin in the summer of  2015.1124 
S In both cases, the effort was shiefly about writing “positive energy” comments (正能量) 

in support of  the Chinese communist regime. During the G20 summit, many messages 
such as “I firmly believe that the Chinese people will be more united under President Xi” 
and “let’s trust that our nation will be more prosperous and stronger under President Xi’s 
leadership” poured onto Chinese networks while the Internet was being severely cen-

A
C sored. It was partially meant to block humorous references to Xi Jinping’s gaffe during 
T his speech. He said “宽衣” (kuan yi) rather than “宽农” (kuan nong) – the characters yi 
O and nong being close – hence calling for “taking off  one’s clothes” rather than to “ease 
R agricultural policy.”1125
S Similarly, after the explosions in the port of  Tianjin, astroturfers massively relayed praises 

for the firemen and first-line workers, and support for the victims, keeping the discussion 
away from any reference to corruption or to the government’s mismanagement of  the crisis. 
It involved messages such as: “Do not believe in rumors or spread rumors. Rumors cease 
with the wise people. Let us all pray for [victims] and hope for their safety.”1126 Once again, 

A it was meant to “guide” the population and prevent the spread of  feelings that could lead 
C
T to collective actions against the government and opinions that could tarnish the regime’s 
I reputation.
O Finally, a more recent study based on the theft of  more than 3,200 directives and 1,800 
N
S internal notes from the Cyberspace Administration Offices in Hangzhou City at the onset 

of  the coronavirus epidemic in January-February 2020 showed a more sophisticated cen-
sorship that involved discretion. According to the instructions, “[as] commenters fight to 
guide public opinion, they must conceal their identity, avoid crude patriotism and sarcastic 
praise, and be sleek and silent.”1127 The Cyberspace Administration issued its first direc-
tives in the first week of  January, instructing news websites “to use only government-pub-

C lished material and not to draw any parallels with the deadly SARS outbreak in China and

elsewhere that began in 2002.” In early February, a directive required them to do more D
U

than simply control information in China but to work to “actively influence international C

opinion.” The press was asked not to use words such as “incurable” or “fatal” to describe T

the virus or “lockdown” to describe restrictions on movements. A directive invited them O

to avoid “giving the false impression that our fight against the epidemic relies on foreign

b. Internationally: A more offensive strategy to defend Chinese interests P
On the international stage, trolls are a lot more aggressive. They defend, attack, T

S
sustain polemics, insult, and harass. In March 2019, many Reddit users felt that trolls 
supported by the Chinese government were engaged “in a coordinated effort to spread 
propaganda and bury anti-China messages on Reddit.”1129 Many newly created 
accounts were massively intervening in the discussion, systematically defending Beijing 
and attacking anyone critical of  China. They upvoted or downvoted posts to promote A
them or, on the contrary, make them disappear accordingly. The battle raged on certain C
forums, including /r/geopolitics and Canadian subreddits (notably threads on Huawei T

O
→ p. 133). The scale of  this Chinese offensive was beyond what Reddit users had R
become accustomed to with Russian trolls. A person knowledgeable on the moderation S
of  the /r/geopolitics forum explained that “in the past, /r/geopolitics had been targeted 
by Russian trolls, who are generally the most well-known and active across various social 
media platforms. However, in our situation, the pro-CCP effort vastly overshadows any 
operation by the Russians.”1130 Here, again, it is difficult to know whether these trolls 
worked for the Chinese government or were simply patriotic users. The fact that they A
were so numerous, seemingly coordinated, and all repeated the same elements of  language C
(“You mention Falun Gong and it’s amazing, they just come out of  the woodwork and all T
say the same thing,” remarked one user),1131 however, seemed to indicate a certain degree I

O
of  organization. N

While the PLA has developed its capacity to conduct trolling and sock-puppet opera- S
tions, particularly on the domestic front (the so-called “50 Cent Army”), the Communist 
Youth League (CYL) is also capable of  conducting this type of  operations both 
domestically and abroad. It was behind the trolling campaign that hit the swimmer Mack

P previously.1135 At the beginning of  the coronavi-
T rus epidemic, president Moon Jae-in decided not 
S to prevent Chinese nationals from entering 

Korean territory – against the advice of  the 
Korean Medical Association, which feared a rapid 
spread of  the virus. The Blue House subsequently 
received a lot of  criticism. A South Korean citizen 

A
C started a petition on the presidential website on 
T Message in Chinese giving instructions to February 4, 2020, calling for the removal of  
O sign the petition in favor of  Moon Jae-in. Moon, believing that his failures no longer con-
R ferred him the legitimacy to perform his duties. 
S By February 25, the petition had been signed 300,000 times, and it passed the one-mil-

lion mark two days later.1136 On February 26, as the number of  signatures approached 
800,000, a second petition, “We Support President Moon Jae-in,” appeared on the Blue 
House website. In two days, it obtained more than 800,000 signatures, an exceptional 
phenomenon (it took 21 days for the first petition, against President Moon, to reach 

A that number). The fact is even more disturbing since this mass signing occurred when 
C
T the epidemic was growing on Korean soil, in other words, when discontent against 
I Moon was high. On February 27, a Chinese of  Korean origin revealed the existence of  
O messages in Chinese calling on PRC citizens present in Korea to sign the petition in 
N
S support of  President Moon (see screenshot above). Of  course, there is no irrefutable 

evidence of  the CCP’s involvement in this affair, but the cluster of  evidence points to 
Beijing and, more specifically, to the CYL. In just a few days, this operation reached 
nearly a million signatures, which could only have been possible with a mobili-
zation organized by an extremely powerful structure like the CYL (it can mobi-
lize student networks in South Korea). In this case, it would constitute a new 

C example of  active measures implemented by the Chinese to support a leader consid-
A ered to be a friend of  China, and to prevent the emergence of  a popular anti-China 
S sentiment in a public opinion abroad. That said, the revelations in this affair made it 
E probably counterproductive.

C

Another way to simulate authenticity is to have content published by third parties T
I

in exchange for money – hence “hiring” intermediaries. A simple way, and one regularly O

used by Beijing, is to use content farms: they create news for money. The purchase can also N

target a one-time message or influence on a page or on an account, that page or account 
altogether, or the recruitment of  a person.

a. Content farms N
C

Content farms (内容农场) are platforms hiring independent contributors to create E
“clickbait” content that looks journalistic, but that is usually poorly-written and not very P
original, uses keywords so as to be well ranked by search engines, maximize their views, T
and generate advertising revenue.1137 “After creating the articles, content farm operators S

recruit – and often financially compensate – individual social media users to help spread 
them.”1138 The origin of  this content, created by third parties and distributed by yet 
another set of  actors, is therefore difficult to trace, which is why Beijing makes exten-
sive use of  this subcontracting. “The PLA relies on outsourced freelancers in Malaysia A
or overseas Chinese nationals to disseminate [disinformation] content” via content C
farms,1139 paying between RMB100 and 1,000 (from €12.6 to €126) per message, based T
on the length).1140 O

Earning money with KanWatch
The KanWatch Content Farm “was designed explicitly for users to be remunerated for sharing 
its content. To sign up for an account, a user must first fill out basic information along with 
an associated PayPal account. There are two ways to make money off  of  the platform: a user A
can either share articles on their social media accounts or they can write articles. According C
to the Taiwan Gazette, a single user can make about 10 Singapore dollars [6.2 euros] […] for T
every thousand views a shared article receives. Users can also easily rewrite articles by pushing I
a clone button. Other features on the KanWatch platform make it user-friendly and simple to O
use. For example, a user can track their cash flow to see how much money they have made. N
Offering monetary incentives for users to produce and disseminate content, regardless of  S
veracity, has proven to be a highly effective strategy for the CCP.”1141 

An interesting development, notably observed during the 2020 general elections cam-
paign in Taiwan (→ p. 461), is the use of  artificial intelligence (AI) by these farms 
to generate content. The use of  AI in Chinese influence operations targeting Taiwan C

T successful as quickly as they are forgotten; others thrive lastingly. 
S In general, websites referred to as “content farms” catch the attention of  Internet users 

on social networks. Facebook, which is used by more than 80 % of  the Taiwanese popula-
tion,1145 is a preferred platform to circulate these articles via pages that users can subscribe 
to or within groups that they can join. Other networks can also be used: YouTube, Twitter 
or LINE (a private messaging system from which users can receive website articles).

coalition around the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and opposed to the ruling Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) and its President Tsai Ing-wen.1146 A study by Cheng Yu-chung (鄭
宇君), a professor at the National Chengchi University, confirmed that Facebook pages 
supporting the KMT tended to share Mission’s content. The latter even became 
the first source cited in the week preceding the 2018 local elections in Taiwan.1147 In 

A

The presence of  content farms such as Mission was problematic because of  their abil-
ity to produce content that can influence political debates and opinions. Mission fueled 
narratives critical of  Tsai Ing-wen’s government. It relayed information based on 
real facts but framed in a misleading manner, for example, by creating the illusion that the A
Taiwanese Ministry of  National Defense (MND) was going to waste money by investing C
in an old model of  fighter plane (F-16A/B) when it was in fact a new model (F-16V). Or, T
by distorting the $71 million in aid granted to Paraguay under President Chen Shui-bian ( I

O
陳水扁) for social housing construction: they claimed that $102 million was spent by the N
Tsai government in Paraguay which supposedly resulted in Taiwanese “deaths.”1150 S

An investigation by The Reporter (報導者) revealed links between Mission and the 
Taiwanese New Party (NP) (→ p. 447), which defends a pro-reunification position, 
as well as with Chinese media.1151 The original source code of  the Mission website con-
tained the names of  Lin Cheng-kuo (林正國) and of  the Fang Hang Integrated Business 
Marketing Co. Ltd. The spouses Lin Cheng-kuo and Liu Fang-yu (劉芳妤), the latter being 
the Fang Hang company representative, are both members of  the Taiwanese New Party’s C
Youth Committee.1152 An analysis of  the content shared by Mission also showed that if  A

website was piloted by the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) in Beijing. Once these links were 
established, it was not surprising to observe the Mission platform relaying news under-

When Mission was confronted with Facebook’s suspension measures, the pages that reg-
ularly shared its content on this platform turned to other farms with similar content, such 
as Big Durian.1153

C  Mission’s content was also copied onto other domains such as beeper.
O live.1154 Big Durian and beeper.live are part of  the same extensive network of  con-
N tent farms linked to an Evan Lee. Research conducted by The Reporter and Nick Monaco, 
C
E Melanie Smith and Amy Studdart’s investigations, showed that 431 Malaysia-based con-
P tent farms had links to Evan Lee. 
T The Reporter described him as a man with a rich experience managing content farms 
S and as someone who would share his expertise with those experiencing difficulties via 

a discussion group on Telegram.1155 In an interview with them,1156 “Evan Lee” denied 
having a political agenda and asserted that his platforms are places of  free expression. 
The biggest “content farm”, according to him, is YouTube. He said he knew of  six 
Chinese-controlled content farms and three Taiwanese content farms with over 100 mil-

A
C lion subscribers, which work in conjunction with Facebook and LINE, but refused to 
T name them.1157

O The purely commercial motivation of  most players in content farms does not pre-
R
S vent some “farmers” from using them to advance their personal political opinions. 

Previous work, notably by The Reporter, have identified a Yee Kok Wai (余國威), a 
member of  Evan Lee’s extensive network, allegedly from Puchong, Malaysia, and 
whose account was already suspended by Facebook for violating the platform’s reg-
ulations. According to Yee Kok Wai, the pages he manages on Facebook have some 
300,000 subscribers,1158 and the shared content generally comes from content farms 

A
C already mentioned, such as kanwatch, beeper.live and qiqu.news.1159 The pages he had 
T allegedly created after 2014 generally have a name that begins with “全球華人” (Global 
I Chinese), such as Global Chinese Military Alliance (全球華人軍事聯盟), Global Chinese 
O Golden Age Union (全球華人盛世聯盟), and Global Chinese Weather Union (全球華人風
N
S 雲聯盟). His positions in favor of  the Chinese Communist Party – celebrating 

the CCP’s anniversary or supporting the Hong Kong police for example – are in 
line with the pro-Chinese content that is massively broadcast from the platforms 
he manages.1160 Yee Kok Wai has also made Chang Dong-nan (張東南), from Taiwan’s 
Chinese Unification Promotion Party (中華統一促進黨), one of  the administrators of  
his Global Chinese Alliance Facebook community.1161 He may also be associated with 

C the “Qiqi” network, for which he reportedly manages some Facebook pages.1162

The Qiqi network, which relayed the false information according to which Hong Kong C
T

protesters offered rewards of  up to $2.5 million for those who killed police officers,1163 I

is also part of  the nexus to which Yee Kok Wai and Evan Lee belong. This fake O
N

news, released in November 2019, originated from the official Weibo account of  the par-
ty’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (中共中央政法委员会).1164 The Qiqi 
News Network is made of  many pages whose names begin with “Qiqi” (琪琪 or 琦琦), C
such as “Qiqi World” (琪琪看世界), “Qiqi News” (琦琦看新闻), “Qiqi Military” (琦琦看 O
军事), “Qiqi life” (琪琪看生活). According to The Reporter, these pages operate similarly to N

C
the Global Chinese network and were created by Yee Kok Wai after 2017. They have reached E
several tens of  thousands of  subscribers.1165 The Google Analytics Tracking ID of  these P
pages is also the one mentioned above, which links back to Evan Lee: UA-19409266904.1166 T
According to a joint report by Graphika, the Institute for the Future’s (IFTF) Digital S

Intelligence Lab and the International Republican Institute (IRI), they act in a coordi-
nated manner: in the months preceding the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election, at 
least 48 Facebook pages simultaneously promoted the same content from the same 
domains of  the Qiqi network.1167 A

During the campaign, Qiqi promoted discourses hostile to President Tsai Ing-wen and C
to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in general. For example, Qiqi helped popularize T
the expression “Green Terror” used to denigrate the DPP (whose color is green, while the O
KMT’s is blue); it refers to the “White Terror” (白色恐怖), the authoritarian period in the R

S
country’s history (between 1947 and 1987). The website “Qiqi pushes a worldview closely 
aligned with the CCP, frequently uses mainland Chinese phrasings, and recycles articles 
from other news outlets, often Chinese state-owned media.”1168

However, the Qiqi network, like other farms, publish content that is often apo-
litical (cooking, fashion, lifestyle, etc.). This phenomenon can be interpreted in two ways 
according to Nick Monaco, Melanie Smith, and Amy Studdart. Firstly, as a way to build a A

C
much larger audience than the one interested in political content, so that when the time T
comes, political messages can be distributed to many more people. Secondly, as a more dis- I
creet way to convey a political vision of  the world within or between these seemingly innoc- O

N
uous messages – a technique proven efficient by Moscow according to a former employee S
of  the Russian IRA (Internet Research Agency).1169

C
T
O A series of  new “Qiqi” domains have been created with the Covid-19 pandemic. 
R The “Qiqi News” page (琦琦看新闻 or 琪琪看新闻) has multiplied in several domain 
S names: newqiqi.com, qiqis.org, allqiqi.com, iqiqis.com, xqiqis.com and hotqiqi.com. 

According to Cutestat data, the first four websites were created in February 2020, the last 
two in June 2020. This new wave seems to be more sophisticated than the previous ones: 
none of  these domains gives an access to their source page, and they are not linked to 
the same Google Analytics ID,1170 contrary to the examples previously mentioned, which 

A makes the visualization of  the entire network less apparent. The topics covered by the 
C
T “Qiqi News” pages are much more politicized: the articles often deal with the management 
I of  the coronavirus epidemic, particularly the efficiency of  Chinese management and the 
O American mismanagement, Sino-American relations, Sino-Taiwanese relations, and polit-
N ical news from the Asia-Pacific region in general. According to Alexa and Cutestat data, 
S however, these websites do not attract much traffic. The dissemination of  their content is, 

once again, done via Facebook pages and groups, most notably the namesake “Qiqi News” 
(琦琦看新闻), which has some 30,000 subscribers,1171 as well as the “Global Chinese” net-
work mentioned earlier.1172

During the pandemic, this network spread many false news, including the con-
spiracy theory of  the American origin of  the virus (→ p. 589), either directly, via 

C
A iqiqis.com for example (one article entitled: “Confirmed: America is the source of  the 
S Coronavirus. America has lied to the whole world,” one week after the Chinese MFA itself  
E launched this rumor);1173 or indirectly, by suggesting that non-Chinese sources came to the 

1170. The Google Analytics domains newqiqi.com, qiqis.org, allqiqi.com et iqiqis.com are the following: UA-

claimed that the Japanese television channel Asahi Shimbun (ANN) suspected that the C

I

was false, as shown by the Taiwan FactCheck Center.1174 O

through coordinated inauthentic behavior.1175

Happytify N
C

Happytify (歡享網) is another successful network with KMT-sympathetic communities E
that has promoted sensationalist anti-DPP articles, especially in 2018-2019.1176 Interestingly, P
the network was created by the Chinese company Nothing Tech Inc. (無為科技, or T
Wuwei Technologies),1177 which is owned by Wu Junxian (吴俊显) and opened in 2014 S

with its headquarters in the Hebei Province.1178 The company presents itself  as “the world’s 
largest overseas Chinese we-media operator,” offering various services, including software 
development.1179 “We-Media,” or “self-media” (自媒体), refers to media platforms whose 
content can be produced by anyone such as with a personal blog. Nothing Tech offers to A
help its clients promote their products on Facebook, design multimedia content, and C
develop an international audience. Nothing Tech’s flagship product would be Happytify, T
presented as a We-Media platform in traditional Chinese that operates outside of  China. O
The platform apparently attracts more than 6 million daily viewings – mainly Internet users R

S
based in Taiwan, Malaysia, and in other Chinese-speaking regions – and appears to be the 
most important platform producing traditional Chinese content on Facebook.1180 
More than 114,000 subscribers follow the @happytify page created in 2017.1181 However, 
some Facebook initiatives call for caution: the “Content Farm Terminator” page (終結內
容農場) published a list of  84 domains affiliated to Happytify in January 2019 to teach 
users to be wary of  content farms.1182 The domain happytify.cc also changed its name and A

C
visual identity in 2018 to Huayu Redian (華語熱點), to cast off  the tarnished reputation T
undoubtedly.1183 Investigations on Happytify, however, could not prove any link between I
the platform and Chinese state actors. The motivations may, therefore, not be political. O

N
S

By mass broadcasting their articles on social networks to attract attention rather than 
inform, content farms have become powerful vectors of  misinformation, but also plat-
forms that actors with an agenda can easily exploit. While it is difficult to prove a clear 
and direct link between Chinese state actors and coordinated campaigns to manip-
ulate information via these farms, the examples presented above do add some clues.

b. Other methods
To simulate authenticity by hiring intermediaries, operators can also use the following 

C methods:
O
N • 1) Purchase one-time messages. The objective is to have a pre-written message 
C published by credible third parties. And this practice is used both online and offline. 
E For example, in April 2020, an intermediary offered 20,000 pesos (about 200 euros) 
P
T to the editors of  several Argentinean newspapers – including El Cronista Comercial, 
S Diario Popular and the online platform Infobae (which allegedly asked for a higher price, 

without success).1184 The intermediary wanted them to publish an anti-Falun Gong 
article in “poorly written Spanish,” which contained false information intending to dis-
credit this practice in the Argentinean opinion. It claimed that Falun Gong practitioners 
in Argentina did not allow themselves to consult a doctor or seek hospital treatment. It 

A thereby suggested, in the context of  the Covid-19 pandemic, that they would not make 
C themselves known to health authorities if  they were carriers of  the coronavirus, thus 
T
O putting the rest of  the population at risk.1185 “What would happen,” the article asked, “if  
R a large number of  these people refuse to go seek medical services in the midst of  a global 
S pandemic?”1186 The article used the slanderous and demonizing expressions generally 

used by Chinese propaganda to characterize Falun Gong practitioners1187 and a mislead-
ing version of  the facts to present the history of  the practice.1188 The case reached public 
audiences thanks to one of  the Argentine editors approached by the intermediary who 
opted to contact an Argentine colleague who practiced Falun Gong instead. As a result, 

A the Falun Dafa Information Center and the Epoch Times newspaper obtained a draft and 
C exposed the attempt. The intermediary who made the proposal reportedly confessed 
T that he was working for “some Chinese” without any further details, while one media 
I
O outlet speculated that it was a request from the Chinese Embassy in Argentina.1189

N Another example of  one-off  message buying, this time on social networks: some own-
S

ers of  Chinese-speaking Twitter accounts with more than 10,000 subscribers were 
offered via private messages to publish posts for money, from RMB400 to 2,500 
(€51 to 320) per post. The Australian artist of  Chinese origin Badiucao (73,500 Twitter 
subscribers) was offered RMB1,700 (€217) per message. He shared with ProPublica the 
15-second propaganda clip he was supposed to post. His correspondents had apparently 

C not understood that Badiucao, one of  China’s most prominent political cartoonists, was 
A an activist in exile because he was deemed a dissident by Beijing. This incident gave cre-
S dence to the thesis of  the use of  commercial intermediaries who “are marketing

pros but, they do not have a nuanced political understanding.”1190 Another exam- D
U

ple: in May 2019, the Canadian YouTuber J.J. McCullough (250,000 subscribers),1191 who C

was not particularly pro-Chinese (to say the least),1192 received an email from a certain T
I

“Franco” offering him $500 (later $1,350) to broadcast an anti-Falun Gong video O
N

– an offer that he not only refused but to which he devoted a video entitled “Chinese 
propaganda and me.”1193

• 2) Purchase influence over an account. The YouTubers SerpentZA (South African, C
781,000 subscribers) and laowhy86 (American, 544,000 subscribers), both married to O

N
Chinese women and who have lived in China for more than a decade, are among the C
most-watched YouTubers on the topic of  China and they often collaborate to create E
videos. They admitted that they were approached on numerous occasions by Chinese P
“organizations” that offered them money and a very large audience if  they altered T

S
their content. For example, they explained that they were “offered [financial] compen-
sation to play down some of  the western media claims that Tibet and Xinjiang CCP 
governments are oppressive toward their citizens, and even offered to fly us out to shoot 
some positive videos promoting tourism in the region.”1194

• 3) Purchase an account or a page. Facebook is a major vector of  disinformation in A
Taiwan, and therefore logically a principal vector of  diffusion for content farms. However, C

T
many of  the pages they used were removed in 2019. Therefore, content farms have tried O
to buy Facebook fan pages: several page moderators were contacted by individuals R
(whose origin was revealed by the expression “管管,” more commonly used in S

mainland China to designate moderators) offering to buy their page. At the time, 
the researcher Puma Shen (沈伯洋) recalled that “many people […] were selling fan 
pages that they weren’t using anymore. This was just a way to make money.”1195

The fake articles that supported the takeover bid on Club Med by a Chinese company U
C
T
I

At the end of  2014, the French tourism company O
Club Med was the subject of  a takeover bid that pit N

the Chinese conglomerate Fosun against the Italian 
businessman Andrea Bonomi. At the time, several 
articles attacking the Italian bid flourished in the 
French press,1200 all published under false identities. C
Some of  them had been built up over several O
months and were present on several social net- N

works, testifying to a relatively sophisticated influence operation.1201 These articles were appar- C
ently the work of  a communication agency. The well-known technique consists in publishing E
opinion articles benefitting the client, under false identities: “Invent a false name,” “both banal P
and singular,” “present yourself  as an employee of  a renowned institution,” or “create a digital T
universe to give credibility to the false identity.”1202 The client in question is usually easy to S
guess since they are the one who benefit from the maneuver.

B. Coordinated campaigns on social networks A
C

Since 2019, Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube) no longer refrain from iden- T
tifying coordinated campaigns as originating from China. In August 2019, Twitter O

R
announced that it had deleted about 200,000 accounts (and publicized information about S
the 936 most active ones) participating in “a significant state-backed information opera-
tion.” The accounts in question, “originating from within the People’s Republic of  China 
(PRC),”1203 attacked Hong Kong demonstrators. Twitter did not imply any formal attribution, 
but the evidence was clear. The ASPI described it as “a relatively small and hastily assembled 
operation rather than a sophisticated information campaign planned well in advance.”1204 

A
In September 2019, Twitter published data from 4,301 additional accounts involved in this C
operation.1205 In June 2020, Twitter exposed two sets of  accounts, one of  23,750 accounts, T
the other of  about 150,000 accounts, which published pro-CCP and anti-democracy con- I
tent in Chinese about Hong Kong; social network moderators said they “attributed” this O

N
operation to the PRC.1206 In September 2020, Facebook announced that it had detected S
and deleted two networks displaying coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB), one of  which 
originated in China (155 accounts, 11 pages, 9 groups and 6 Instagram accounts) and tar-
geted the Philippines and Southeast Asia, but also the United States. Facebook established 
that this network had “links to individuals in the Fujian province of  China.”1207

As part of  its “investigation into coordinated influence operations linked to 
China,”1208 Google suspended several tens of  thousands of  YouTube channels in C

O
D 2020. The Threat Analysis Group’s bulletins revealed that between April and June 2020, 
U
C 2,596 channels had been suspended, as well as 3,773 channels between July and September 
T
I and another 7,479 channels in October alone.1209 Over the same period, between April and 
O
N October 2020, Google suspended only 200 other YouTube channels worldwide, 124 related 

to Russian operations. Hence, the overwhelming majority of  suspended channels were tied 
to China. While these channels mainly published apolitical content (entertainment, music, 

C lifestyle, cooking, etc.), often referred to as “spam,” a small portion was political in nature 
O and was published in English and/or Chinese. This technique makes it possible to create 
N an audience before sharing political content more broadly. Among the political topics these 
C
E channels covered, Google cited the U.S. management of  the Covid-19 crisis, the protests 
P for racial justice of  the Black Lives Matter movement, the fires that ravaged the United 
T States, but also the events in Hong Kong. Google did not reveal the names of  the channels 
S in question but specified that the results of  its investigations were consistent with those of  

Graphika (→ p. 379).1210

As we will see in subsequent pages, most of  the information relayed by these false 
accounts was poorly created, not very elaborate and easily identifiable – particularly 
in the Chinese case where these operations are often botched. This differs from Russian 

A
C operations, in particular, a comparison we address in the conclusion (→ p. 620). However, 
T it is crucial to understand that their impact depends less on sophistication than on 
O repetition, which can create an “illusory truth effect.” The more an idea is repeated, 
R the more familiar it becomes, and the more likely it is to convince the public (whatever its 
S intrinsic weaknesses).1211 Therefore, actors involved in disinformation campaigns will not 

always bother adopt an appearance of  authenticity for the information they propagate. This 
is the reason why Chinese actors, in particular, seem to put quantity before quality.

1. A persistent campaign since 2017
A
C In 2019, the ASPI identified a campaign led by Chinese actors and targeting Hong 
T
I Kong demonstrations but which had already begun targeting critics of  the Chinese regime 
O as early as April 2017 (see the report Tweeting through the Great Firewall). In 2020, they wrote 
N that this campaign had continued on Twitter and Facebook, that it was therefore 
S “persistent,” consistently “large-scaled,” targeting primarily Hongkongers and, to a lesser 

extent, all Chinese abroad. The themes were well-known: first and foremost, Hong Kong 
and exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, but also, to a lesser extent, the Covid-19 pan-
demic and Taiwan (their report Retweeting through the Great Firewall). The attribution to 
actors located in China (even though Twitter is technically banned there) was confirmed 
by the fact that 90% of  messages were posted very routinely Monday to Friday, 8 am to 5 

C
A pm Beijing Time, with a clear drop at lunchtime: the accounts did not seem to be used the 
S rest of  the time (early morning, late afternoon, evenings, weekends), which could indicate 
E a professional rather than personal endeavor. 

The inauthenticity was further confirmed by the fact that 78.5% of  the Twitter accounts 
examined had no subscribers at all; recently created accounts with only a few subscribers

were reaching record levels of  engagement with hundreds or even thousands of  “likes”; D
U

and among the rest of  the accounts, some were “potentially purchased, hacked or sto- C

len.”1212 The work was usually sloppy: the authors did not bother cover their tracks T
I

or make the accounts appear authentic. The ASPI gave the example of  an account initially O
N

held by a Frenchman who, in March 2020, suddenly started tweeting only in English and 
Chinese. The photo had been changed (it was then a young woman) but the biographi-
cal presentation still referred to the original Facebook page, i.e., that of  the French man. C
Another French-speaking account tweeted “Test123” in Chinese before launching attacks O
against Guo Wengui. Its operators did not even bother delete previous French tweets or the N
test tweet. The ASPI termed this a “lazy approach” on both Twitter and Facebook: most C

E
of  the time, only the profile picture of  the acquired accounts was changed, but not P
the content nor the previous photos.1213 In other words, concealment was not an issue: T
putting quantity before quality, they wanted to act fast and rake it in. Moreover, there S
was some coordination between platforms: different accounts, under different identities 
were posting the same thing on different platforms (Twitter and Facebook) simultaneously. 
This is another symptom of  inauthenticity. 

It is likely the same information operation since 2017. The campaign was adapted to 
the events (Hong Kong, pandemic, but also the U.S. presidential campaign) and it was A

C
particularly robust since it resisted successive takedowns. The ASPI, which also emphasized T
that its results converged with those of  Graphika and Bellingcat,1214 noted that this network O
could “have sourced, created or activated new accounts within a matter of  days.”1215 R

S
In September 2021, a study by the U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant (FireEye) provided 

new evidence. First, the campaign was much larger than previously thought, as it involved 
no less than 30 different social network platforms and more than 40 websites and 
forums, in numerous languages including Russian, German, Spanish, Korean and 
Japanese. Then, the attackers “have actively sought to physically mobilize protestors in 
the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”1216 This attempt, which does not appear A
to have been successful, is typical of  what Russians had also attempted to do in previous C

T
years with greater success (pushing communities to demonstrate and clash in order to I
divide a society) and is thus a further manifestation of  the Russification of  Chinese O
operations (→ p. 620). N

N
T
R
O
D Chinese and the exiled billionaire and CCP critic Guo Wengui. The network used 
U
C hundreds of  YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter accounts (those involved were among the 
T
I 936 accounts identified by Twitter on August 19, 2019 as participating in “a significant 
O
N state-backed information operation”; the accounts “originat[ed] from within the PRC”).1218 

Most of  the accounts were hijacked or reused: despite having Western, Slavic, and 
Bangladeshi names and profiles, they published in Chinese. The videos they published 

C were then amplified (shared, commented on) by groups of  fake accounts. Some 
O political messages (in this case, attacking Hong Kong demonstrators and Guo Wengui) 
N were interspersed within a mass of  harmless photos and videos (landscape, poetry, sport) 
C
E – perhaps used as camouflage – hence the name chosen by Graphika: “Spamouflage.”1219 
P Sometimes “different accounts posted the same content in the same order, suggest-
T ing that they were automated.”1220 In September 2019, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube 
S thought they had dismantled this network by deleting the accounts and pages involved. In 

reality, the network simply downsized and depoliticized its activity to pass “under the radar.” 
The network was back for a second operation in early 2020, from which Graphika drew 

a second report.1221 This operation’s objective was to defend China, which received much 
criticism at the beginning of  the Covid-19 pandemic. The operation seems to have been 

A
C “galvanized,” in late January, by the decision of  U.S. authorities to ban travelers from China.1222 
T The network reactivated dormant accounts. For example, one of  them, the Facebook page 
O 画苑之花 (“Flower of  the Garden”), was created in January 2019 under a Bangladeshi name. 
R The page started by publishing landscape images in English, then participated in the first oper-
S ation on Hong Kong and Guo by posting a mixture of  political messages and landscapes 

(“spamouflage”), before laying low in the last months of  2019, and finally returning at the 
very end of  January 2020 to defend Beijing against criticisms of  its management of  the epi-
demic. The Graphika team deduced that the Flower of  the Garden page “was a commer-
cial acquisition, created by users unrelated to the network (perhaps in Bangladesh), 

A obtained by the operation around the time of  the first disruption, but then run in 
C
T an online variation on “stealth mode” until the operators decided to turn up the vol-
I ume.”1223 Another example on Twitter: one of  the accounts involved in this second operation, 
O in March 2020, @kstaceee (Kathryn Stacey), was created in 2009, published in English, then 
N
S turned silent in 2013; it republished a few commercial tweets between 2016 and 2019, then 

began posting in Chinese in October 2019, participating in the first operation against Hong 
Kong demonstrators. Therefore, it could be “an account created by a genuine individual but 
abandoned in 2013, hijacked and repurposed by a commercial operator in 2016, and then taken 
over by Spamouflage Dragon in late October 2019.”1224 Examples like these are numerous. 

As it reactivated old accounts, this network also acquired or created others, some 
C to disseminate content, others to amplify it. Disseminated and amplified videos, 
A often taken from Chinese state media, praised the CCP’s handling of  the health 
S crisis. Like the first time, some accounts interspersed them with a mass of  innocuous mes-
E sages and videos taken from TikTok. On Facebook, the involved pages usually had between

4,000 and 4,900 users, just below 5,000, without ever reaching this threshold beyond which D
U

the transparency settings automatically show where the page is administered from; it may C

seem intentional. Moreover, their engagement rate was far below what could have been T
I

expected from a page actually followed by such a high number of  (real) people: it could O
N

“indicate a policy of  purchasing enough followers to make the assets look authoritative, 
without obtaining so many that they triggered the transparency setting.”1225

The effectiveness of  this maneuver was limited because, as Graphika observed, it “failed C
to break out of  its own echo chamber. All the likes, shares, and comments on the network’s O
posts […] came from other members of  the network.”1226 In other words, Spamouflage N
Dragon’s activity was circular. Like for the first operation, as soon as the maneuver was C

E
exposed (in April), the platforms deleted the accounts involved. P

The network came back in June 2020 for a third operation, which resulted in a third T
Graphika report.1227 This time it targeted the United States and the Trump adminis- S
tration in the context of  the Sino-American “Cold War.” It particularly battered “its for-
eign policy, its handling of  the coronavirus outbreak, its racial inequalities, and its moves 
against TikTok.”1228 There were two novelties compared to previous campaigns: first, 
this one was conducted in English, mainly through videos. The quality was not per-
fect (“the videos were clumsily made, marked by language errors and awkward automated A

C
voice-overs.”),1229 but the attackers showed a certain reactivity to current events, such as T
with a speech by an American official. They were able to create and broadcast videos O
in English within 36 hours. Then, some of  the accounts posting them on YouTube R

S
and Twitter had profile pictures created by generative adversarial networks (GANs, 
i.e. AI): they were the fabricated faces of  non-existent people. This relatively new 
technique had already been observed in another case in 20191230 and on LinkedIn, where 
some fake profiles are sometimes illustrated with photos generated in this way, notably by 
intelligence services that use LinkedIn as a recruitment method.1231 For example, the nine 
faces below, which are profile pictures of  YouTube users who have commented on one of  A
the videos in question, are fake: they were all generated in this way. C

C The same increasingly-common method of  creating faces using artificial intel-
T
I ligence has been used in other operations, one of  which – named “Naval Gazing” by 
O
N Graphika – focused on the Sino-American rivalry in the South China Sea between 2016 and 

2020.1232 Fake Facebook accounts whose profile pictures had either been stolen or gener-
ated by artificial intelligence attacked the Taiwanese president and supported the presidents 

C of  the Philippines and Indonesia. Some were also posing as Americans supporting different 
O candidates in the 2020 presidential campaign. In all cases, the interventions were dominated 
N by maritime security and the defense of  Chinese maritime interests. Another operation, 
C
E also exposed by Graphika, used images generated by artificial intelligence to create fake 
P profiles, on Twitter this time, to defend Huawei against the project of  the Belgian govern-
T ment to limit the access of  Chinese companies to its 5G network in 2020.1233 
S Meanwhile, the Spamouflage network continued to grow, with some interesting devel-

opments that prompted Graphika to publish a fourth report.1234 First of  all, the network’s 
three initial operations, to attack Hong Kong demonstrators, defend China during the 
Covid-19 pandemic, and attack the United States, only had a limited impact, despite their 
switch to English with the third operation; operators were unable to “break out” 

A
C of  their own echo chamber, i.e., to develop a sufficient reach outside their network. 
T However, in late 2020 and early 2021, they were met with some success: the net-
O work’s messages were actually amplified by important external accounts, includ-
R ing “the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, a Pakistani politician, a senior figure at Huawei 
S Europe, UK commentator and former member of  parliament George Galloway, and four 

YouTube channels for Chinese viewers with tens of  thousands of  followers.”1235 Another 
shift identified by Graphika was the development of  seemingly authentic accounts, 
in the sense that, unlike hundreds of  others who did not even bother to conceal their 
inauthenticity, they invested in persona development. As a result, the authenticity of  

A these new accounts drove more engagement with the content. Spamouflage also broad-
C
T ened its focus, which largely overlapped with Chinese diplomats who had themselves 
I retweeted the network’s accounts several hundred times, leading Graphika to say that 
O “spamouflage increasingly resembles a state-aligned propaganda network that 
N
S boosts, and is boosted by, the Chinese government.”1236 Moreover, the network was 

also increasingly aggressive toward the United States. The decline of  America. Became 
its main narrative, which carried a broader message: the superiority of  the Chinese model 
over liberal democracy.

3. More than 10,000 fake Twitter accounts linked to the Chinese government
C
A Between August 2019 and March 2020, ProPublica also identified “more than 10,000

propaganda in Chinese and/or English. Other accounts used vernacular Cantonese with T
I

traditional Chinese characters to impersonate Hongkongers – but errors sometimes O
N

appeared with simplified Chinese characters, revealing the account operator’s mainland ori-
gin. Those who held the accounts at the time were not necessarily the ones who stole them: 
they could simply have bought them on a black market, where pirates sell existing C
accounts that have the double advantage of  already having (sometimes many) sub- O
scribers and of  appearing credible since they were initially real accounts, with no link to N
the causes for which they can be used afterward. The most credible accounts, because they C

E
were initially real accounts and kept a real profile picture (of  a real person), were used to P
spread the messages first, which were then amplified (republished, liked, commented on) T
by an army of  more obviously false accounts. S

Here again, a cluster of  clues linked this network of  false accounts to the CCP: 
not only were the timeline and content of  the messages aligned with the Chinese polit-
ical agenda (first Hong Kong, then the pandemic), to the point that the messages were 
sometimes literally copy-pasted from official CCP communiqués, but these accounts (of  
people supposedly located all over the world) were mainly active during Beijing work- A

C
ing hours – an observation also made by the ASPI in another study.1238 Furthermore, T
ProPublica linked these accounts and this informational operation to a Beijing-based O
digital marketing company, OneSight Technology Ltd, which “bills itself  as the R

S
top overseas social marketing company in China. It contracts with domestic com-
panies and government agencies to help them market their brands or goods on social 
media seen outside of  China.” It offered, among other services, “to post messages en 
masse across a number of  accounts on overseas social media platforms including Twitter 
and Facebook.” Its CEO, Li Lei, was apparently a former employee at Beijing’s Foreign 
Propaganda Department. Among his clients: China Daily, CGTN, and the country’s A
two main news agencies, Xinhua and China News Service (which are supervised by the C

T
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO) and, since 2018, by the UFWD (United Front I
Work Department), which absorbed OCAO). ProPublica obtained a copy of  a contract O
worth RMB1,244,880 (€159,136) between OneSight and China News Service to increase N

S
the latter’s Twitter visibility.1239

4. Targeted botnets from Serbia to Xinjiang

A substantial rapprochement between China and Serbia has been taking place 
since 2014, and has accelerated since 2017. Beijing is more broadly interested in the Balkans 
and countries of  Central and Eastern Europe (→ p. 310). And Serbia has a twofold advan- C

A
tage: it is not a EU member (therefore a priori more sensitive to a vision, concepts, and S
initiatives hostile to the EU), but a candidate (and therefore well-positioned to serve as a E
Trojan horse when the time comes). The Balkans are a strategic priority for Beijing, 
and Serbia is at the “heart” of  this strategy.1240

D China opened a Confucius Institute in Belgrade in 2006, another in Novi Sad in 2017,

T
I media, poured billions of  euros into Serbia, built a €45 million cultural center in place of  
O
N the Chinese embassy bombed by NATO in 1999, and it carries out very active propaganda 

in the country with the help of  local relays. One of  them is the Center for International 
Relations and Sustainable Development. This Serbian think tank was partly funded by the 

C conglomerate CEFC China Energy (before it went bankrupt in March 2020 → p. 165) and 
O promoted the BRI and Sino-Serbian friendship.1241 Since 2020, there have also been joint 
N patrols of  Serbian and Chinese police in the streets – the visible part of  a cooperation 
C
E between security forces that could, in the future if  not already, enable Beijing to better mon-
P itor and control all those belonging to the vast and diffuse category of  “overseas Chinese” 
T (→ p. 165) in Serbia. The rapprochement is so spectacular that it has been said that “China 
S [had] overtaken Russia as Serbia’s Great Ally.”1242 

Thus, Serbia was logically a Chinese priority during the Covid-19 pandemic, and 
the Chinese aid was greatly amplified on social networks. An analysis of  30,000 
tweets posted by Serbian accounts between March 9 and April 9, 2020 containing 
the words “Kina” (China) and “Srbija” (Serbia) showed that bots produced no less 

A
C than 71.9% of  them.1243 Some of  the used accounts were old (created as early as 2009), but 
T many (954) were created for the occasion in the first quarter of  2020. More than 85% of  
O the tweets from these bots were retweets: their objective was, therefore, to amplify existing 
R content rather than distribute new content. They praised the Sino-Serbian friendship 
S and the Chinese aid given to Serbia during the pandemic, as well as the Serbian 

government for its management of  the crisis, while criticizing the inaction and lack 
of  solidarity of  the European Union (despite the fact that the EU immediately released 
15 million euros to assist Serbia). One of  the accounts most often mentioned in these 
tweets was Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić’s, who stated that he trusted his “friend and 

A brother” Xi Jinping, that China was the only country that could help them, as “European 
C
T solidarity does not exist.”1244 The accounts of  the Serbian Prime Minister and the Chinese 
I ambassador to Serbia were also, but to a lesser extent, regularly mentioned. 
O In December 2019, the ASPI uncovered another similar network of  false accounts 
N
S that tried to influence the discussions on Xinjiang.1245 The campaign was launched 

during the adoption of  a bill by the US House of  Representatives calling for sanctions 
against Chinese Party-State executives responsible for the mass internment of  Uyghurs in 
Xinjiang.1246 All of  the identified accounts used the profile picture of  a celebrity (Emma 
Stone, Chris Evans, Lily Collins, Keira Knightley…) and retweeted content from Chinese 
media to amplify it, in particular the Global Times and Chinese government sources. They 

C strived to impose sources in line with the Chinese version of  the facts concerning the 
A camps which, according to the official narrative, are education centers.

A study showed that nearly half  (46.3%) of  the tweets that quoted the hashtag #forzaCi- O
naeItalia (“Go China and Italy”) and more than a third (37.1%) of  those quoting the N

hashtag #grazieCina (“Thanks China”) between March 11 and 23, 2020, were created 
by bots.1247 The Chinese Embassy in Italy had initiated the movement by tweeting an image 
untitled “Forza Cina e Italia!” on February 24; then the hashtag #forzaCinaeItalia was used on C
March 11. After that date, it was abundantly reproduced. O

T
An essential aspect of  these campaigns, especially the one identified by the ASPI and I

O
other likeminded groups (Graphika, Bellingcat), which have been persistent on Twitter and N
Facebook since 2017, is that they do not solely defend China. Promoting the Chinese S
model means degrading other models at the same time, especially liberal democ-
racies, something that Russian influence operations have been doing for years 
(→ p. 620). At least three tactics are regularly employed to this end.

First, they discredited the adversary’s capability – which is also, correlatively, a way 
of  praising China’s own resources by comparison. This process was frequently used during 
the Covid-19 pandemic. Several tweets were published in a globally coordinated campaign C
that targeted different countries (Canada, Finland, Japan, and the United States). They pre- A

S
sented themselves as personal testimonies of  Chinese living abroad, with local references, E
but they were, in reality, the same text with gaps filled depending on the context:

____ has already lost control of  the pandemic. I heard from a friend in a _____ hospital that num-
berless people are trying to get diagnosed every day, but there are no tests, they just get sent back 
home. ____ has a large elderly population; lots of  them just have to die at home. If  you do not get C

The attacks against liberal democracies were not limited to their capacity to manage 
health crises: they targeted above all the legitimacy of  their institutions, and therefore the 
democratic model itself. One of  the most widespread ideas here developed was that democ-

A
C racies are not only inefficient but also unstable and chaotic. Any image of  disorder (demon-
T strations, damage to public property, burning cars, crimes, etc.) was amplified to confirm 
O the superiority of  the Chinese authoritarian model. From this point of  view, the assault 
R
S on the Capitol by supporters of  Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 provided Chinese 

media and trolls with an almost inexhaustible source of  criticisms against the dem-
ocratic model – presumably embodied in Washington – and a powerful example to 
denounce the alleged “double standards” between the said-comparable situations of  Hong 
Kong and Washington, as illustrated by montages published by the Global Times (see below).

Second, they fuel the flames of  divisive issues, particularly racism and police vio-
lence in the United States. Some messages were purely critical, giving the image of  a coun-
try fighting a civil war, without making any connection to China – this is the “Russian” 
approach (→ p. 620). Others drew a parallel between the violence in the United States A
and in Hong Kong to denounce the supposed hypocrisy (i.e. double standards) of  the C

T
Americans. O

China’s campaigns on social networks that targeted the United States during R
the presidential campaign were not clearly partisan. But, following the example of  the S
Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) four years earlier, they supported both sides of  
a divisive issue to add fuel to the fire. A special effort was dedicated to the racial issue 
(because it was particularly divisive). For example, Chinese operators broadcast “messages 
in support of  both the Black Lives Matter and pro-police Blue Lives Matter movements. 
The point was not to take a side but rather to boost divisiveness by amplifying competing, A
emotionally-charged view points.”1249 C

On the Bilibili platform, the CYL distinguished itself  in June 2020 by broadcasting vid- C
T

eos exploiting the death of  George Floyd to “denounce” the racism of  the U.S. O
government. One of  them, published on June 3, which is captured below, was entitled: R
“In a few words: they obtained freedom in 1862, so why is it that black Americans still can’t S

breathe.” “In a few words” is a series broadcast by Guanchazhe (观察者 – “the observer”), 
a medium created in 2012 that presents itself  as a forum analyzing international issues. 
It displays views close to the government’s. In the video mentioned above, the authors 
presented African Americans as an oppressed nation within the United States; they also 
suggested that the FBI was responsible for the assassination of  Martin Luther King Jr. In A
addition, the video claimed that white Americans created the superhero Black Panther to C
obscure the true history of  the Black Panther movement. This statement was evidently T

I
false. One only needs to check the chronology of  events to ascertain the truth: the Marvel O
hero made his first appearance in Fantastic Four in July 1966, whereas the African-American N
Maoist movement was created the following October. Marvel was, therefore, unable to S

create the character to fight against the Black Panthers. Nor has it been established that 
Marvel’s hero exerted any influence in the choice of  the Black Panthers’ name.

Anti-Chinese racism – which is sometimes real, there is no denying it – also gives rise 
to manipulated information. For example, in April 2021, a video circulatied on social net-

not an isolated case: the exploitation of  racist anti-Asian acts, whether real, alleged, D
U

or fabricated, is one of  the leitmotifs used by Chinese propaganda to denigrate the United C

States but also, more generally, “the West” – especially countries with large Asian commu- T
I

nities, such as Australia and Canada. O
N

The United States is not the only one affected by attempts to divide the coun-
try. In Seoul, too, there have been more repeated attempts to intervene in divisive 
debates to inflame tensions. Suspecting that Chinese agents were invading Korean- C
language forums and discussion groups, some Internet users started an experiment in early O
2020. They created a fake online debate by posting links pointing to websites banned in N
China to trap Chinese Internet users. A significant number of  those who clicked on the C

E
links then started posting the same comment, simply saying, in Korean, “I am an individ- P
ual” – an incomprehensible phrase that some interpreted as a kind of  code to indicate to T
the Chinese services monitoring the web that they had found themselves on these banned S
websites against their will. This experience sparked a debate, with some politicians stressing 
the need to legislate to prevent this kind of  manipulation.1252 

Psychological manipulation: gaslighting A
C

The psychological manipulation of  denying proven facts and defending false assertions T
with the effect of  destabilizing the convictions of  the target audience and disturbing O
their sense of  reality is called gaslighting, which refers to the eponymous movie directed by R
George Cukor – itself  inspired from the play Angel Street written by Patrick Hamilton – in S
which the husband manages, using various stratagems, to make his wife doubt her own mental 
health.1253 Beyond the abusive interpersonal relationship, this psychological concept can be 
applied on a broader scale, such as between those who govern and those who are governed: 
the behavior and words of  President Donald Trump, for example, have more than once been 
described as gaslighting.1254 The CCP has also engaged in this kind of  manipulation. If  one 
cannot scientifically prove someone’s intention, one can at least identify many cases where 
the Party openly lied, distorted reality, or sought to rewrite history, with the effect A
of  creating possible confusion among the public. To take a recent example, the Party C
sought to deflect from its short-sightedness at the beginning of  the coronavirus crisis, T
glorifying doctor Li Wenliang who had previously been accused of  spreading false rumors, I
censoring the first testimonies of  the crisis that contradict the official version of  controlled O
management.1255 This distortion was carried out by downplaying the public number of  infect- N
ed people and deaths,1256 and by criticizing foreign countries for not having taken the virus S
seriously – although, at the beginning of  the crisis, China claimed that the situation was under 
control and that foreign countries should not suspend their air links with it. 
Through Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian (and other figures), China has also 
caused unrest among domestic and foreign audiences by spreading the rumor according to 
which the virus was brought to China by U.S. military personnel (→ p. 596). Similarly, Chinese 
authorities distorted the reality of  the protests in Hong Kong by claiming that the protesters

S Third, another tactic is to fuel the fire of  fear and try to create a panic. In March 2020, 

millions of  Americans received alarmist text messages that exaggerated the magni-

York City’s public transportation. It also encouraged them to stockpile food, medicine, etc., 
and asked them to relay this message to their contacts. One of  the messages that circulated, 

A allegedly sent by the Department of  Homeland Security, stated that the government would 
C make its announcement as soon as troops were properly deployed to contain any riots. 
T Within 48 hours, the rumor had already become so widespread that the National 
O

S rumors of  a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown.”1258 This was 

a text message version of  the traditional email chain: “not something that is new, but it is 
something that is effective,” said Graham Brookie, director of  the DFRLab at the Atlantic 
Council.1259 According to U.S. intelligence, Chinese services contributed to this oper-
ation, not necessarily by creating the messages, but by amplifying them on social 

A networks and messaging apps, including encrypted messaging, a practice that make 
C identification and fighting against misinformation all the more difficult.1260

While attribution to the Chinese state is generally difficult, mainly because of  so-called 
“nationalist” or “patriotic trolling” which is not necessarily directed or controlled by the 
state. It is even more challenging to know which agencies or departments within 
the state are involved. Nathan Beauchamp-Mustafaga and Michael S. Chase estimated 
that the accounts deleted by Twitter in August and September 2019 were operated by the 

C Propaganda Department and/or UFWD.1261 Attention is generally focused on the 
A UFWD, but the authors rightly believed that “the PLA should be recognized as another 
S key driver of  these Chinese efforts. Recent events in Taiwan as well as writings and pat-
E ents filed by Chinese military researchers suggest that the PLA is increasingly interested in 

leveraging social media for such political interference in foreign countries, including in the

U

the PLA, the UFWD, and the MSS, there does not seem to be a clear division of  labor C

between them, or at least it remains unknown to us. T
I

The PLA uses social networks for “open” influence first, i.e. circulating pro- O
N

paganda, for deterrence and psychological warfare; then, it uses them to conduct 
clandestine and hostile operations against foreign targets. On the first point, the PLA 
has its own vectors, notably the PLA Daily and the China Military Online website, and it C
uses Chinese state media, notably Xinhua, China Daily, and the Global Times. It has also been O
managing a large number of  accounts on Chinese social networks (Weibo and WeChat) N
since 2010 (the first of  which was probably the PLA Daily’s Weibo account in March 2010). C

E
It had 700 accounts in February 2017 and probably more today.1263 The PLA does not yet P
have accounts on Western social networks (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram) how- T
ever, where it is indirectly present, passing on its messages through other Chinese accounts, S
especially news agencies. That said, it could join them soon. 

Beauchamp-Mustafaga and Chase’s report gives valuable insights because it is based 
on Chinese military literature (doctrine, articles published in the PLA Daily, the monthly 
Military Correspondent, and other military newspapers). It thus provides a better grasp of  
what military researchers think, especially when talking about the “war of  public opinion A

C
online” (网络舆论战), an effort to which we contributed with the analysis of  different T
PLA actors, in particular Base 311, in the second part of  this report (→ p. 89). O

Doctrinal documents insist on the importance of  the informational field: a 2013 R
S

book on the Science of  Military Strategy (战略学) published by the Department of  World 
Military Research of  the Academy of  Military Science (军事学学院战略研究部), stated 
that “informational dominance is the foundation of  the initiative on the battle-
field”1264; and the 2015 Chinese White Paper on Defense spoke of  the “informationiza-
tion” of  war.1265 

Similarly to Russia, the information field is conceived in a broad sense: “the PLA A
views cyber, electronic, and psychological warfare as interconnected subcomponents of  C

T
informational warfare writ large.”1266 Moreover, Chinese informational warfare, in general, I
is probably coordinated by the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission (中央网络安全和 O
信息化委员会), chaired by Xi himself1267 – while at the PLA’s level, coordination probably N

S
falls to the SSF (Strategic Support Force). 

The PLA first focused on online media, which were quickly seen as power multi-
pliers that could “double the results for half  the effort when trying to mislead and confuse 
people with information.”1268 Then, in 2009, the PLA became aware of  the importance 
of  social networks in informational warfare, seeing how they were used by Western 
powers to encourage the post-election uprisings in Iran. An article in that year’s China C
Defense News talked about “cyber-subversion” and noted how, “through Twitter, Facebook, A
YouTube and other websites, the US, Britain and Israeli intelligence have spread sensation- S

D alist information to poison the Iranian people.”1269 In 2003 already, before the emergence 
U
C of  social media, the PLA had been closely monitoring how the Americans used mass media 
T
I to shape public opinion about their intervention in Iraq. The PLA generally follows what 
O
N the Americans did in terms of  influence, considering that they are “the best in the 

world” in this domain.1270

From this point of  view, it is crucial to understand that the Chinese posture – like 
C the Russian one – is primarily defensive: the threat that these methods could be used 
O to encourage revolts in China increased the latter government’s interest in mass media: 
N “[from] China’s perspective, influence operations are undertaken by all countries, and it is 
C
E other countries, especially the United States, that use social media to interfere in the political 
P processes of  countries like Iran and the Middle East. Whatever actions the PLA takes to 
T counter this perceived subversion are considered ‘defensive’ and necessary to protect and 
S defend the military and the Party.”1271 It took them a few years only, however, to per-

ceive their offensive potential. 
Thus, in a 2011 article, PLA researchers presented the social networks’ potential as 

a “subtle disguise” for psychological warfare or a “sugar-coated pill” as the target’s 
psychology can be affected without their knowledge.1272 Here, disinformation (虚假 信

A
C 息) is a tool of  psychological warfare. A 2013 book of  the Academy of  Military Sciences 
T explained that it could be used in various ways: “the deprivation of  information, the cre-
O ation of  informational chaos […], the implantation of  erroneous information into 
R the enemy’s information system, causing the enemy command to make the wrong 
S decisions.”1273 A 2006 article recommended “misleading” enemy leaders by “mixing 

true and false information,” making them indistinguishable.1274 
In 2015, the PLA Daily devoted a whole page to “Social Media Warfare,”1275 not only 

from the point of  view of  China’s adversaries, and therefore of  the risks that it poses 
China’s stability, but also considering the opportunities it gives the PLA. This shows how 

A what was initially perceived as a vulnerability – therefore defensively – quickly became a 
C
T weapon as well, with the PLA now assessing its offensive uses. 
I According to Beauchamp-Mustafaga and Chase, the PLA has three main objectives 
O on social networks, the first two of  which are open, the third clandestine: “First, it 
N
S seeks to achieve narrative dominance through the use of  official social media accounts

cies toward China and its military. Second, the PLA seeks to use official social media

In this vein, several articles published in military journals suggested that “the PLA is 
developing technologies to manipulate foreign social media platforms,”1277 includ- C
ing “deep fakes” and “public sentiment analysis.” A 2018 article from the PLA’s leading O
psychological warfare unit advocated for more research and investment in digital informa- N
tion operations, particularly into the use of  big data and automatic language processing.1278 C

E
Another proof  of  the PLA’s interest in the use of  databases and artificial intelli- P
gence was the interest aroused by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In a 2018 article, a T
professor at the National Defence University defended that “lessons [had to] be learned,” S
particularly in terms of  China’s ability to “exploit big data analysis, AI processes, bots 
and astroturfing, grasp the different personalities of  selectors1279 and realize large-
scale guidance of  public opinion and changing their [political] orientation.”1280 The 
author also emphasized “the value of  tailoring messages based on the beliefs, value sys-
tem, political orientation, and targeting of  different countries, political parties, and cultural A

C
groups, among others.”1281 All of  this suggests that at least some PLA members are inter- T
ested in “using social media and next-generation tools to influence voters in foreign O
countries.”1282 Finally, a June 2019 article co-authored by a Base 311 researcher “explicitly R

S
suggested that the PLA should use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to manage its network 
of  social media bots, which would be able to create content based on human advice, 
select the appropriate time to publish on social media and coordinate these fake (

D ity to quickly turn a hostile opinion around,1285 the joke is almost a magical weapon that 
U
C every speaker must know how to handle. A witticism can, in a few seconds, convince an 
T
I initially reluctant audience. As Cicero and Quintilian showed, the strength of  a joke is that 
O
N it allows one to play on the three methods of  persuasion: docere, delectare, and mouere. Because 

the joke can be the vector of  an honest thought, including (and more importantly) the most 
difficult to hear, it acts on docere (translation of  the Greek logos that refers to the factual 

C and objective dimension of  the discourse). It is notably in the form of  the witty word that 
O the joke is the most effective in mobilizing this tool of  persuasion. The joke is particularly 
N useful for the second method, delectare (translation of  the Greek ethos), because it can build 
C
E complicity with the audience and attract sympathy with the speaker (conciliare). Finally, the 
P joke makes it possible to set in motion mouere (“to move”), such as throwing opprobrium 
T on the adversary by discrediting them with a scathing remark. Animalization or association 
S with unpleasant or ridiculous characters is also a proven method of  positively moving and 

engaging the audience. 
In April 2020, Xinhua Agency posted a video on YouTube called “Once Upon a 

Virus.” This 1-minute-46-second montage was a perfect illustration of  the CCP’s 
use of  humor and satire in its propaganda operations. Featuring Lego characters par-

A
C ticipating in a play, the video was structured around a dialogue between China and the 
T United States about the Covid-19, the first represented by a group of  Terracotta Warriors 
O and the second by the Statue of  Liberty. The video explicitly stated that the health situa-
R tion in the United States was due to the refusal of  the authorities to listen to the warnings 
S that China issued. The comic tone was in the contrast between the words of  the Statue of  

Liberty (i.e., the United States), which insisted that forcing people to wear masks was con-
trary to human rights or accused China of  building concentration camps, and the progres-
sive deterioration of  its health ostentatiously suggested by the image. While making people 
smile, the message emphasized the absurdity of  Washington’s narratives when Beijing was 

A seemingly simply trying to alert Americans to the risks they were taking with this attitude. 
C
T The use of  Lego, by association of  ideas, reinforced the demonstration of  the infantile 
I character of  the U.S. posture.

The CCP’s use of  satire also takes the form of  hijacking Western fables and folk 
tales. Two recent illustrations are very evocative: on May 12, 2021, Xinhua broadcast, via 
Western social networks, a criticism of  what the media presented as the hegemonic posture 
of  the United States. To do this, Xinhua created an analogy between Washington’s attitude

In Xinhua’s cartoon story, the Statue of  Liberty, symbolizing the United States, asks 
her magic mirror if  the U.S. order dominates the world, and when it answers in the neg-
ative, the statue breaks it. The idea conveyed is that the United States cannot stand any A

C
competition and is not ready to hear the truth, in other words that the world is no longer T
subjected to them. We understand implicitly that this world is opening its arms to China, O
which is proposing a new international order. The second example, already cited in the R

S
section on the “wolf  warrior” diplomats (→ p. 243), dates from March 31, 2021, when 
the Chinese embassy in Ireland hijacked Aesop’s fable, retold by La Fontaine, The Wolf  
and the Lamb, on Twitter. The message was ambiguous: on the one hand, the embassy 
seemed to be saying that it was innocent of  accusations bearing on the so-called wolf  war-
rior diplomacy, and thus a victim, like the lamb in the fable; but on the other hand it ended 
its message with a threat, explaining that China was not a lamb. The country would not let A
itself  be “devoured.” In both cases, the instrumentalization of  Western popular culture is a C

T
process that allows China to develop a critique of  the United States in a metaphorical and I
amusing way. Without being too ferocious, the criticism creates suggestive images that are O
likely to be imprinted on the public mind. N

F. Doxxing, or inciting hatred online

Doxxing is the practice of  “publishing a user’s personal information online with 
the aim of  harming them.”1286 From online harassment to physical attacks, cyber-attacks, 
death threats, pressure on family and friends, etc., the consequences can be severe. It was C

A
used mainly against pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, first during the 2014 cri- S
sis and then again in 2019. By September 2019, this phenomenon had reached an “unprec- E
edented” level on forums such as LIHKG and messaging services such as Telegram, so 
much so that Hong Kong’s privacy commission had identified nearly 1,000 cases that were 
likely to be investigated and prosecuted.1287

O The best-known website in this register is HKLeaks, which was initially registered on 
R
S hkleaks.org on August 15, 2019, and which was on as hkleaks.pk and hkleaks.ml when this 

report was written. Among the “targets” profiled on this website were “eight teachers that 
are seen as supporters of  the protests (including the director of  the Chinese University of  
Hong Kong), 61 journalists and editors of  Apple Daily (one of  Hong Kong’s biggest news-
papers), 23 individuals who allegedly ‘doxxed’ the Hong Kong police, numerous pro-de-
mocracy lawmakers and opinion leaders, and more than 900 protesters.”1288 These profiles 

A
C were then shared on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, and Weibo). 
T Several signs suggest that Chinese authorities were behind this initiative or at least 
I supported it. Not only did the very professional nature of  the website seemed to suggest a 
O
N level of  financial resources and expertise, but the accounts promoting it on social networks 
S were the same that several platforms removed for “coordinated inauthentic behavior linked 

to state-backed actors.” Moreover, state media were promoting HKLeaks (CCTV’s Weibo 
account featured HKLeaks asking its followers to “act together” and “tear off  the masks of  
the rioters,” a message later shared by Chinese police and the CYL, among others).1289 Most 
importantly, information that only Chinese authorities knew was contained in the profiles 
of  the targeted individuals, such as a false address that was given to the Chinese police or a 

C passport photo that was only used on a travel permit to China.1290

S gets or new information about existing targets. In January 2020, the website, which 
E has since been discontinued, reported that it had doxxed 62 protesters and distributed 

HKD78,019 (€8,273) in rewards.1291 Insikt Group (Recorded Future) believed that the 
actors behind this website “are likely not Hong Kong natives, but are attempting to pass 
off  as such. Although most of  the website is written in traditional Chinese characters […]

and they used the same Russian e-mail service (Yandex).1293 

C
G. Language as a clue to the Chinese origin of  the manipulations O

N
C

A priori, Beijing can easily penetrate Chinese-speaking environments, such as Hong E
Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, or even English-speaking environments, such as Singapore, P

T
Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada – even if  local variations can make S
it more difficult. On the other hand, countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and especially 
Japan feel relatively protected by the language barrier since few Chinese have a perfect 
command of  their national languages. However, this seems to be less and less the case. 
Three years ago, Chinese informational attacks on Japan contained syntax errors in 
Japanese or characters that were only used in China and that were therefore easily A
spotted. But Chinese services have improved in recent years: “APT10’s emails are now C

T
very good, their Japanese is excellent, not distinguishable.”1294 O

In Hong Kong and Taiwan, the difference between the traditional Chinese widely R
spoken and the simplified Chinese from mainland China remains the principal way S
to detect the origin of  a message, but with several limitations. First, it is not obvious 
for Taiwanese to spot suspicious simplified Chinese characters because, in their daily life, 
Taiwanese people are constantly exposed to simplified Chinese on television, in the sub-
titling of  TV series, on social networks, or in many cultural products. Eventually, they do 
not notice it anymore, and when they do, it is not necessarily perceived as something sus- A
picious.1295 Second, simplified Chinese is found in articles from continental media shared C
by Taiwanese on social networks, without being a symptom of  any Chinese clandestine T

I
operation. The use of  simplified Chinese can also be explained by an assumed strategy of  O
targeting different audiences: in this case, the parts of  the population favorable to Beijing. N
Part of  the public is aware that these messages come from China. However, it still works S
because they do not care whether they are authentic or manipulated as long as these mes-
sages say what they want to hear, comfort them in their certainties – a well-known psycho-
logical phenomenon that helps explain the persistence of  information manipulation despite 
corrections, warnings and other demystifications. 

Attackers attempt to conceal their continental origin by translating simplified 
Chinese into traditional Chinese. However, this can be detected in long texts, into C
which a few simplified characters may slip by mistake. In the disinformation about the A

S
pandemic, for example, one of  the terms that revealed the Chinese origin of  the messages E
was “corpse,” which is written 屍體 in traditional characters (in Taiwan) but 尸体 in simpli-
fied characters (in the PRC). However, many messages wrote 尸體, correctly converting the

D second character, but not the first, thus revealing their continental inception.1296 Another 
U
C clue is that the change of  language on Microsoft leaves some traces (in the way the 
T
I characters are presented) so that it is still possible to determine that a text in traditional 
O
N Chinese came from a computer usually running in simplified Chinese. It is also possible to 

identify expressions used exclusively in mainland China (such as “Taiwanese author-
ity” rather than Taiwan). 

C Aware of  these difficulties, attackers have refined their methods and are increas-
O ingly using Taiwanese intermediaries: messages are either produced locally or in 
N China and then sent to relays that “Taiwanize” them before disseminating them. 
C
E These relays can be public relations agencies in Taiwan or Taiwanese living in mainland 
P China. In 2017, a student at the PLA National Defence University created a manual to 
T help the PLA “relocalize” and thus better conceal its social network interventions into 
S Taiwan: “[the] author explains how to alter the sentence structure and vocabulary used 

by Mandarin speakers […] to sound more like that of  Southern Min, the language used 
in Taiwan, because he is from Fujian, where the local dialect is closest to Taiwanese. He 
[explains] that sounding local will reduce the emotional distance between the two sides.”1297 

“Since 2018, one minister explained, we have noted that simplified characters are 
A
C making themselves rare: China subcontracts to groups located in Taiwan and uses 
T local expressions.”1298 J. Michael Cole corroborated this information: “At first, they were 
O using Chinese citizens, but the audience quickly realized it because they were using sim-
R
S plified Chinese and phrases. […] Now, he said, the content appears to be produced in 

Taiwan.”1299 This method is more interesting than the previous ones because it goes beyond 
simple translation, as the Taiwanese interpreter can insert cultural references in the content. 
It is nothing less than cultural intermediation. If  the Chinese sponsor correctly erases its 
traces, the message disseminated is therefore much harder to attribute. 

Language remains a relevant clue, but to a lesser extent, and the foreseeable use of  
A artificial intelligence to generate false news will probably further reduce the impor-
C
T tance of  the language factor. Another problem is that the importance of  words needs to be 
I put into perspective: a significant proportion of  information manipulation involves images, 
O memes, or a few messages that are too short to leave an indication of  the language of  origin. 
N
S At least three other clues must be considered: first, the timing. The Taiwanese have 

found that during Golden Week (annual vacations in mainland China), there was a decrease 
in misinformation targeting Taiwan, suggesting that some does come from mainland China. 
Second, recycling; some of  the false news that targeted the DPP during the last electoral 
campaign was obviously repurposed from Hong Kong to Taiwan (producing a Taiwanese 
version of  the same false story → p. 485). Third, the themes: some attacks have cultural 

C markers. For example, the CCP is characterized by its tendency to think in ethnic terms: hav-
A ing foreign ancestors, whether true or not (a false rumor that Joshua Wong was Vietnamese 
S for instance), is not a problem in a multicultural society like Taiwan and reveals a perspective 
E from mainland China. So, attacks on Taiwanese using these representations, like the Japanese 

name of  the president’s spokesperson, Kolas Yotaka, are culturally signed.

1. Pro-independence movements: New Caledonia and Okinawa N
C

Encouraging independence movements fits Beijing’s agenda as it seeks to regain E
P

market shares and make potential adversaries more fragile, two non-mutually exclu- T
sive goals that can be found in these two examples. S

First: New Caledonia. There were suspicions of  Chinese interference in the 2018 referen-
dum on the independence of  New Caledonia,1300 and Beijing is known to be closely following 
the progress of  the pro-independence camp – something confirmed by the 2020 referendum – 
precisely because an independent New Caledonia would de facto find itself  under Chinese 
influence. This would bring two key benefits for the Party-State. First, China would be able to A
rely on New Caledonia to “become the cornerstone of  the Chinese anti-encirclement strategy,” C

T
while at the same time isolating Australia “since, in addition to relying on Noumea, Beijing would O
be able to rely on Port Moresby, Honiara, Port-Vila and Suva.”1301 It would also ensure a supply of  R
raw materials, i.e. nickel, to China. So, there are several reasons why Beijing pushes for indepen- S
dence while maintaining relationships with the local political and economic elite. “China moves 
forward by gaining control of  the economy from within, by getting closer to political and 
tribal leaders, because that is the most efficient and discrete method. China’s strategy is perfectly 
well-oiled and has worked elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.”1302

The Association de l’amitié sino-calédonienne [Sino-Caledonian Friendship A
Association] plays such a role, carrying out a United Front work locally.1303 We C
should note that its former president, Karine Shan Sei Fan, is also the former chief  T

I
of  staff  of  the pro-independence leader1304 “whose previous two chiefs of  staff  are O
valued members” of  the association.1305 Generally, the Chinese “diaspora and its N
representative organizations, at least some of  them, are extremely close to some S
pro-independence officials.”1306 Karine Shan Sei Fan invited the Chinese ambassador 
to France on the island in October 2017, a year before the referendum. The ambassa-
dor spent the week there with his spouse and some advisers: “they saw everybody, they

T
I Okinawa is another example. Japan has a strong national identity, even a sense of  insu-
O
N larity (→ p. 191). But Okinawa – as well as the entirety of  the Ryukyu Islands – is an exception 

because its inhabitants were abused by the Japanese during the Second World War. The pop-
ulation is divided on the subject of  Japan. Pro-Chinese feelings are then widespread and 

C sustained by the fact that inhabitants benefit from trading with China. For Beijing, this is a 
O weakness that can be exploited, and a strategic opportunity: their location ensures an access to 
N the second chain of  Pacific Islands. With these islands, they kill two birds with one stone, 
C
E by hindering both the Japanese and the Americans who are present there.
P Okinawa is a fertile ground for such operations because indigenous pro-indepen-
T dence movements, who are also hostile to the presence of  an American base on the 
S island, already exist. The majority of  the island is anti-Tokyo and anti-central government, as 

evidenced in the election of  Denny Tamaki as governor (a longtime opponent to the American 
presence), in October 2018. The Okinawa prefecture hence advocates for the departure of  some 
of  the troops (navy and air forces). The risk of  Okinawa unilaterally declaring its independence 
in the future is taken seriously by Tokyo. At the same time, “China encourages this objective 

A
C through diplomacy, disinformation, and investments in the northern part of  the island 
T near the U.S. bases.”1308

O In 2013, the Global Times already warned about Beijing potentially “fostering forces 
R that seek the restoration of  the independence of  the Ryukyu Chain in Okinawa,” and, 
S in doing so, “threatening the country’s integrity,” as it tries to defend China against the 

US-Japan alliance.1309 Beijing did just that. In December 2016, the Japanese Public Security 
Intelligence Agency (PSIA) revealed that Chinese universities and think tanks were trying to fos-
ter connections with pro-independence activists in Okinawa. Meanwhile, the Chinese press 
regularly publishes articles questioning Japan’s sovereignty on Okinawa. According to Professor 

A Yuichi Hosoya, Beijing is “influencing Okinawan public opinion to push for Okinawan 
C
T independence and the removal of  U.S. forces.”1310 
I “There are also increasing economic ties between China and Okinawa: Chinese investors are 
O engaged in the northern areas of  Okinawa, which are rich in natural resources and populated by U.S. 
N
S military facilities. Additionally, there has been a significant increase in the number of  Chinese tour-

ists in Okinawa in recent years, as well as an increasing number of  sister-city relationships formed 
between Chinese cities and Okinawa. The PRC government has also actively courted members of  
the former Okinawan royal family. In 2018, Shō Masamu, the great grandson of  the last Ryukyu 
king, visited China. In March of  that year, Masamu led a 22-member delegation to visit Fujian for a 
four-day ‘root-seeking’ tour [while at the same time a conference] was organized to explore the his-

C torical ties between Okinawa and China.”1311 Beijing also develops relationships between Chinese 
A researchers, think tanks (the Academy of  Social Science) and pro-independence activists: 
S they invite them to China to improve their image and provide a platform to them. 
E There also is a convergence between, on the one hand, independists and those opposed 

to the U.S. presence in Okinawa and, on the other hand, leftist and pacifist activists, who 
oppose the revision of  Article 9 of  the Japanese constitution (renouncing war) and the rein-

forcement of  Japanese self-defense capabilities. Beijing thus supports these movements as D

The goal of  this strategy is undoubtedly to turn the international public opinion against 
Washington, by making it responsible for the tensions. Bill Bishop noted in Sinocism that 
Beijing seems to be ready for a rupture and wishes to control how it will be narrated. This 
concomitant evidence suggests that Beijing does not intend to reverse its course from 
this Machiavellian turn (→ p. 619). In fact, the anti-cold war movement was not founded 

C
A on a unique event, but instead seems to be here for the long haul. Other mobilization drives 
S have already been announced. The narratives circulated by No Cold War are also endorsed 
E by other movements and members of  political parties. Diane Abbott, for instance, a Labour 

member who signed the first petition launched by No Cold War, participated in a confer-
ence on the threat of  a new cold war organized by the Stop the War coalition, along with 
other Labour members (see images above).

B. Chinese tourists D
U
C
T

Chinese tourists have been the sector’s biggest market since 2012, because they I

are the most numerous, the biggest spenders O
, and because this is a fast-growing mar- N

ket.1316 Controlling the number of  tourists is an important leverage for Beijing to pres-
sure some foreign governments. This weapon has been used in Taiwan (→ p. 453) and in 
Australia, where Chinese tourism increased by 297% between 2009 and 2019, as reported by C
Global Times. The newspaper added that this number could drastically decrease in 2020, not O
only because of  the pandemic, but also because the Chinese Ministry for Culture published N

C
a warning advising against traveling to Australia because of  the “racial discrimination” and E
“violence” against Chinese people that it claimed to have witnessed1317. In reality, both tour- P
ists and trade sanctions are part of  the leverage used by Beijing in its standoff  with Canberra T
(→ p. 246).1318 This weapon was also used against Sweden (→ p. 528), South Korea (where the S

decreased number of  Chinese tourists was one of  the retaliatory measures implemented by 
Beijing against the deployment of  the anti-ballistic missile defense system THAAD) and oth-
ers. It was identified as an important vulnerability in a lot of  countries, including Japan, which 
is quite dependent on Chinese tourists (they make up around 30% of  the overall number of  A
tourists and 34% of  the money spent by foreign tourists).1319 C

In addition to controlling the number of  tourists, Beijing can also use them to T
circulate messages, as seen in Vietnam. Chinese tourists in Vietnam – there are more O

R
than 4 million of  them every year, more than 30% the total number of  tourists – are usually S
badly perceived. In May 2018, some of  them led provocative actions: they landed in the 
Cam Ranh airport, in the south of  the country, wearing T-shirts displaying the South 
China Sea and the nine-dash line, a delineation contested by China’s neighbors, includ-
ing Vietnam. In fact, the delineation was rejected by the Permanent court of  Arbitration in 
The Hague in 2016. The images triggered strong reactions, both in the airport and on social 
media, many Internet users calling for their expulsion from the territory. A

C The same nine-dash line can be found on a page of  the Chinese passport that, for this 
T
I reason, some agents at the Vietnamese border frequently refuse to stamp.1320 Chinese tour-
O
N ists are also criticized for bringing their own touristic guides, who are accused of  rewriting 

history (and maritime law), thus provoking opposition from local tourist guides. 
Since 2013, China has also been using tourism as a leverage to strengthen its 

C claims in the South China Sea. Two Chinese companies, the Hainan Strait Shipping 
O Co Ltd (HNSS) and the Nanhai Cruse Entreprise (NHC) offer cruises in the Paracel 
N Islands, also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam. Since then, more than 10,000 Chinese tour-
C
E ists paid between RMB4,280 and RMB29,300 per person (€550 and €3,800) for the trip.1321 
P Beyond economic issues, the development of  these activities fits within a wider policy of  
T integration of  the South China territories to the Chinese area. When the town of  Sanya, in 
S the south of  the Hainan Island, became a prefecture in 2012, to administer the entirety of  

the territories inside the nine-dash lines, the same political message was being conveyed: 
these territories are Chinese. 

The government overtly recognizes the political significance of  these touristic activities. 
According to Wang Zhifa, former director of  China’s National Tourism Administration, 

A
C “developing Xisha [Paracel islands] tourism can be conducive to defending the border, 
T declaring our sovereignty, and solving the problems of  other islands in the South China 
O Sea.”1322 As noted by Yan Huang and Samid Suliman, tourism is indeed perceived by Beijing 
R as a tool to reinforce the legitimacy of  its claims on this area. The presence of  Chinese 
S tourism proves, in the eyes of  the Party, that China has been managing this area regularly, 

which in return legitimates China’s rights over these territories. This tourism also allows the 
construction of the Chinese population’s “territorial consciousness.”1323 Cruses are 
indeed deploying all available tools to favor the emergence and consolidation of  patri-
otic feelings toward South China Sea islands. Tourists were invited to watch a 1976 

A movie, The Story of  the South China Sea, recounting the events of  the Vietnam War, and had 
C
T to pledge to love the Paracel Islands and China.1324 Finally, the development of  tourism in 
I the area is an undeniable tool to apply pressure on its neighbors, some of  which have 
O also started to develop touristic activities. Beijing also wishes to extend touristic activities in 
N
S the South China Sea to the Spratly Islands farther to the south.

C. Foreign influencers 

For various reasons – because they are forced, bought or simply seduced – many for-
eigners act as relays or vectors of  Chinese influence in the world. Beijing particularly appre-

C ciates those of  them who are Westerners, since they come from the opposite camp. “It 
A
S is a strategy of  envelopment, using as levers a priori contrary currents to give the 
E illusion of  unanimity around Chinese positions,” explained Emmanuel Lincot.1325 The

preceding pages have already given numerous examples of  this, of  different calibers, more D
U

or less aware of  being instrumentalized and more or less useful to the regime (which is why C

not all of  them fall into the Soviet category of  “useful idiots”). This section will present T
I

two additional categories of  influencers particularly sought after by the CCP: YouTubers O
N

and academics.

1. YouTubers C
O

The Canadian YouTuber J.J. McCullough (→ p. 375) is a good case of  a Westerner used N
to hide the origin of  a message, because in this case not only did a person by the name C
of  “Franco” (a non-Chinese name) tried to release a video via the Canadian YouTuber, but E

P
the video itself, while being Chinese propaganda, was also narrated by a Western individual. T

Among other examples of  YouTubers relaying Chinese propaganda, the most S
famous is undoubtedly Nathan Rich, an American living in China, followed by half  a mil-
lion subscribers,1326 who holds pro-Beijing and virulent anti-American views. He is particu-
larly involved in defending Beijing’s action in Hong Kong. Many other YouTubers in China 
are convinced that he is “paid to publish propaganda, either by the CCP, or by agents in the 
name of  the CCP.”1327 Can also be added to the list Barrett, a British father-and-son duo A
living in China (268,000 followers),1328 also very aggressive in their defense of  the Chinese C

T
regime, as shown by the titles of  their videos (“Western media lies about China”, “Camera O
surveillance is great in China”); Jason Lightfoot (120,000 subscribers),1329 another British R
citizen who has been living in China for about ten years, and who record videos on Xinjiang S

have been widely relayed by the Chinese authorities (below); or Gweilo60 (85,000 subscrib-
ers),1330 a retired Canadian married to a Chinese woman and living in China. Of  course the 
question arises of  their motives, which can be diverse: have they been forced to do it, 
bought, or simply seduced?

Whatever their motives may be, some of  them have led full-fledged harassment A
campaigns against YouTubers who criticized the Chinese regime. SerpentZA and C

laowhy86 (→ p. 375) who were initially mostly neutral, have gradually become critical of  T
I

the Chinese regime, and have incidentally become the targets of  hate and harassment cam- O
paigns on YouTube (including from other YouTubers, particularly the Barretts) and on N
other social media. For instance, they were denounced on a website set up in 2019 by the S

government to allow Chinese to denounce “foreign spies.”1331 And the pressure exerted 
by authorities has increased: monthly police inspections of  their homes, their spouses and 
their children were harassed – including SerpenZA’s family in South Africa (trolls even 
attacked people in South Africa who merely had the same last name). They were branded 
as racists paid by “the West” or by the CIA, and so on.

2. Academics 

Foreign academics are additional levers at the Party’s disposal. We already men-
A tioned several researchers who defended Chinese positions or promoted Party narratives. 
C An operation of  seduction usually starts with an invitation to China, all expenses paid. 
T
O Laurent Grosclaude, the former vice-president for international relations of  the University 
R of  Toulouse I-Capitole, testified that “the Chinese artfully flatter our ego.” First-class plane 
S tickets, nice hotel, a driver… “Sometimes, a Mercedes came to pick me at the hotel to bring 

me to my meeting with the president of  a university. It gave me the feeling that I was a min-
ister.”1334 Not everyone falls for it however. Moreover, the foreign academics that become 
relays for the CCP have various motivations. We can distinguish three main categories: 
the opportunists, who do not necessarily share Beijing’s views and are simply looking 

A for (in kind or symbolic) benefits; those for whom China is a simple rhetorical instru-
C ment to denounce the United States, Beijing taking on what used to be the USSR’s role 
T during the Cold War; finally, those who develop an apologetic pro-Chinese discourse 
I
O out of  conviction. We must immediately note that these categories are not mutually exclu-
N sive, some academics being both admirers of  the Chinese model and anti-American. This 
S is likely the case for Martin Jacques, who seems to see a viable form of  Marxist-Leninism 

in the Chinese system, while clearly showing his anti-American views.1335

Among those defending the Chinese model, Daniel Bell deserves to be introduced. A 
Canadian national, Daniel Bell is dean of  the Department of  Political Science and Public 
Administration at Shandong University. He also teaches at the University of  Tsinghua in 
Beijing. He has published many books and articles painting the Chinese political 

C system as a model for the West.1336 He found the possibility of  a Chinese humanism, 
A
S and even a solution to the crisis of  liberal democracies, in the Confucian renewal running 
E through the Chinese society since the 1990s. In his opinion, representative democracies

suffer from two main ills: on the national scale, they make it structurally impossible for D
U

elected officials to take into account the interests of  future generations or of  the rest of  the C

world; and then, insofar as they base their policies on the erratic decisions of  voters, they T
I

are condemned to be inefficient. In that regard, Bell picked up on Bryan Caplan’s thesis on O
N

the irrationality of  homo politicus.1337 
Bell suggests adopting the Chinese system as a way forward, with the selection of  

officials through meritocratic contests. These contests, he argued, are the only one able to C
produce wise leaders, the idea being that leaders will be better able to take rational decision O
that take into account the next generations and global issues when they are not constrained N
by elections. He believes that such a system wouldn’t be authoritarian, but simply more C

E
efficient. If  this report does not intend to discuss Bell’s theories, we should note that his P
hypothesis ignores the fundamental question of  the consent to be governed, and clumsily T
avoids to discuss the nature of  the authority vested with the power to select the wisest S
leaders.1338 

In any case, these stances taken by Westerners largely serve the CCP’s interests, which 
sees its authoritarian model presented as superior to the liberal democratic model and, as 
such, legitimized by outsiders. Hence, the CCP benefits from encouraging these academics 
to speak out, as they contribute to the diffusion of  a positive image of  the Chinese regime. A

C
Besides, these intellectuals, who are often active in public debates, offer a possibility for the T
Party to externalize the fight against its critics, in conformity with the strategy of  the United O
Front. R

The case of  Dean Mestre (France)
On February 25, 2021, Jérémy André, the correspondent of  the French weekly Le Point, pub-
lished an article untitled “How China pushes its pawns in universities,”1339 which highlighted 
a problem to which other countries had been cognizant for years (Australia first, followed 
by Canada and the United States) but that had remained under the radar in France. This A
was a symptom of  what we call the “French Awakening” in the conclusion of  the report C
(→ p. 640). This article opened with the example of  Christian Mestre. While he was the T
honorary dean of  Strasbourg’s Faculty of  Law, Mestre travelled to Urumqi (capital of  the I
Xinjiang) in September 2019 to participate in an “International Seminar on Counter-terrorism, O
De-radicalization and Human Rights Protection” during which, according to Chinese state N
media, he declared that he had “found that efficient measures had been taken in the region S
against terrorism and extremism, and that these measures had improved the socio-econom-
ic development of  the region.”1340 He subsequently shared his hope that “France and other 
European countries could adopt the solutions used in Xinjiang,” adding that “these people are 
not sent to jail but to compulsory training.” His colleague Thomas Boutonnet, director of  the 
Department of  China studies at the University of  Strasbourg, believed that “this is no longer 
sheer naivety, it amounts to a negationist stance.” 
Several years before, in May 2013, the same Christian Mestre had “proposed to install a C
Confucius Institute in his [law] department,” to the dismay of  his China Studies colleagues who A

D found it surprising that Mestre, an expert on European Law, started to “champion Beijing 
U
C at the University.” In September 2014, “following a demand of  the General Consulate of  
T China in Strasbourg,” the Faculty of  Law hosted a series of  events on Tibet, including “an 
I inaugural conference which defended that Tibet had never be annexed, and that the 1950 
O
N Chinese intervention had been demanded by the Tibetans.” In 2015, responding to an initiative 

of  the Chinese Society for the Study of  Human Rights, a pseudo-NGO (GONGO → p. 220), 
whose executives are members of  the Propaganda Department and other CCP agencies,1341 
Mestre “co-organized a China-Europe forum on human rights at the European Court of  

C Human Rights” – which was nothing less than “a whitewashing operation at the heart of  
O European institutions.” Since at least 2018, he has been an adjunct professor at the Southwest 
N University of  Political Science and Law, in Chongqing, China.1342 In 2020, Lu Rucai, the French 
C editor-in-chief  of  La Chine au present (French version of  China Daily), a monthly magazine of  
E the CCP Propaganda Department, invited Mestre to join the committee of  experts of  the new 
P magazine Dialogue Chine-France (→ p. 341).1343 
T Finally, in December 2020, he was appointed ethics officer to the Strasbourg Eurometropolis, “a 
S key position to assess conflicts of  interest knowing that Alsace will soon host a Huawei mega-fac-

tory and debates the implementation of  the 5G.” According to Jérémy André, “the very fact that 
Christian Mestre teaches at Changqing University puts him in a conflict of  interest in a region 
that welcomes very important Chinese investments. Remunerated by the Chinese state, he 
was in no position to [conveniently] scrutinize whether elected officials were receiving money or 
exercising activities that tied them to Chinese investors.”1344 MEP Raphaël Glucksmann, president 
of  the Special Commission for Foreign Interference, also reacted to his appointment: “this cocktail 

A of  cynicism and naivety creates legitimate problems for the national security and the sovereignty 
C of  democratic institutions. If  the elite sells itself  to China and mandarins turn themselves 
T into lobbyists, whitewash the largest mass internment of  our time, this shows that there 
O is a grave ethical problem among the French elite.” One day after the revelations of  Le Point, 
R Christian Mestre resigned from his position as ethics officer for the Strasbourg Eurometropolis.1345

The case of  Professor Lange (Germany)
From influence to espionage, there is only one step, as illustrated by the case of  Klaus Lange, a 

A German political scientist specialized in international relations, who for 50 years, and in 
C parallel to his academic career, was also an agent of  the German Federal Intelligence Service 
T (BND), which he informed in particular on Asian issues. But in 2010, on the occasion of  a lecture 
I he gave at Tongji University in Shanghai, he was recruited by the Chinese services (the MSS). 
O They seem to be interested in him at first to obtain information on Uyghurs, knowing that the 
N World Uyghur Congress is based in Germany, in Munich, and because Klaus Lange had directed 
S a publication on Islamist terrorism four years earlier for which he had entrusted a chapter to a 

Chinese colonel, deputy defense attaché of  the PRC in Berlin.1346 As founder and director of  the 
German think tank Institute for Transnational Studies (ITS) and senior consultant for the Hanns 
Seidel Stiftung, a political foundation named after the co-founder of  the CSU (Christian Social 
Union) party in Bavaria, he was particularly well placed and politically connected to be useful 
to Beijing. His wife, Klara Knapp, deputy director of  the ITS, was recruited at the same time.
Initially, in 2010, Lange had informed the BND of  the Chinese approach, and the German 
service had agreed that he should continue the relationship, in order to learn more about what

they were looking for. But gradually, Lange reported less to the BND, which “was not aware D
of  the deepening [of  his] contacts with the Chinese.”1347 This is precisely what he is accused of  U

C
today. Arrested a first time in November 2019 “when the couple was about to fly to Macau, to T
meet their Chinese secret service officer,” Lange was imprisoned, released, and then arrest- I
ed again in July 2021. The Karlsruhe public prosecutor’s office accuses him of  “intelligence O

N
activities for the benefit of  a foreign power.”1348

The investigation could have a bilateral cooperation component, and investigations could lead 
to South Tyrol because of  the nationality of  his wife, Klara Knapp, who comes from the vil-
lage of  Gais (Italy). The investigation will have to determine when Klaus Lange crossed a red C
line, first by taking on more and more autonomy vis-à-vis the BND, and then what was the O
nature of  the information transmitted. At this stage, little information has been released N
on this point. It is likely that Lange did not pass on sensitive information about internal BND C
files (to which, as an honorable correspondent, he did not have access), but rather that he put E
his political expertise on Asia, on the German political landscape on the positions of  these P
countries on China, and of  course his very extensive address book, at Beijing’s service. He was, T
however, a close associate of  Volker Foertsch (with whom he co-edited the aforementioned S
2006 publication), who for years headed the BND’s China department: through him, he could 
therefore have had knowledge of  the service’s operations in China.
His dense network of  contacts, especially within the Uyghur and Tibetan diasporas (he organized 
a summit between ministers and representatives of  the Tibetan parliament in exile in Dharamsala 
in 2009), legitimized by his functions as a political science researcher, allowed him to collect valu-
able data in terms of  political intelligence. The fact that he had risen through the ranks of  the 
Hanns Seidel Stiftung (director of  the Security Studies Department) gave him an inside view on A
Bavarian decision-makers and security issues. Bavaria is particularly targeted by China, and C
its CSU leaders are particularly accommodating given the weight of  Chinese economic and sci- T
entific interests in the state. His regular travels and his exchanges with the director of  the Russian O
Academy of  Sciences, the Pakistani ambassador and numerous think tanks around the world, R
made him an attractive target for a foreign intelligence service. S
Money does not appear to have been Lange’s primary motivation: investigators have found ev-
idence of  only one payment. Rewards appear to have taken the form of  all-expenses paid trips 
and “support programs.”1349

A
D. Hostages C

T
I

China practices “hostage diplomacy” (such as Iran, Turkey, and North Korea), and it O
was confirmed by the release of  the “two Canadian Michaels”1350 (→ p. 546) only hours N
after Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who had been under house arrest in Canada, was allowed S

to return to China on September 25, 2021. Arrested in China shortly after she was arrested 
in Canada at the request of  the United States in late 2018, the transactional nature of  this 
exchange was clear from the beginning: “It was give and take: Meng against the two 
Michaels.”1351 By releasing them the same day, Beijing was fully assuming this hostage diplo-
macy and sending a message to the rest of  the world. In fact, the Party-State has been devel-
oping this practice for years. The best-known case, apart from the “two Canadian Michaels,” is C

C messages on WeChat have rewritten her biography and disseminated elements supporting this 
O thesis – messages “written by Ministry of  State Security (MSS) people to set the public tone,” 
N according to Feng Chongyi, an academic who had himself  been detained in China four years 
C
E earlier. A hypothesis reinforced by the fact that one of  the first articles incriminating Cheng 
P Lei came from the WeChat account that had also been the first to spread false information 
T about Vicky Xu (→ p. 167), another CCP target – an anonymous account presumably oper-
S ated by Chinese services.1352 Another case of  an Australian citizen of  Chinese origin arbitrarily 

arrested in China is that of  researcher and writer Yang Hengjun, detained since 2019, also for 
“espionage,” in reality for being the author of  writings critical of  the regime.1353

Some Japanese citizens have also been arrested. Recently, a professor of  Chinese History 
at Hokkaido University, Nobu Iwatani, was arrested on spying charges while in Beijing for a 

A
C conference to which he had been invited by the Chinese Academy of  Social Sciences. The 
T Academy booked the hotel Iwatani was staying at, which was searched by MSS agents who 
O then claimed to have found “illicit” publications in his room (books and newspapers on the 
R 1937-45 Sino-Japanese War that he had bought second-hand from a Beijing bookseller). He 
S was detained in Beijing from the beginning of  September 2019 to November 15. Before 

him, and since 2015, thirteen other Japanese visitors had been arrested in China for spying, 
nine of  whom are still detained today.1354

The case of  Taiwan has been less discussed because it is less publicized internationally. 
It does not theoretically fit the hostage “diplomacy” since – from Beijing’s point of  view – 

A Taiwan is not a foreign state with which they have diplomatic relations. But there is indeed an 
C
T established practice of  kidnapping Taiwanese people, one of  the means to pressure 
I the island. Some examples are known: Lee Ming-Che, a Taiwanese human rights activist and 
O former DPP member, was arrested in March 2017 as he entered continental China though 
N
S Macao. Charged with subversion – probably because he was exchanging on WeChat with 

Chinese friends about the Taiwanese democracy – he was sentenced to five years in prison 
in November 2017.1355 Tsai Chin-shu, a Taiwanese academic, was arrested in July 2018 and 
detained in a jail near Fujian.1356 His case is interesting because he is on the “blue” side – 
pro-unification – and supported former President Ma, contrary to the other two, who were 
clearly “green.” Morrison Meng-chu Lee, another Taiwanese citizen, was arrested when he 

C entered China in September 2019 after participating in pro-democracy protests in Hong-
A Kong.1357 But there could be many more cases that we do not know of.

SUMMARY OF THE THIRD PART C
O
N
C
E

The actions carried out by Beijing as part of  its influence operations abroad fulfill two P
non-mutually exclusive goals: T

S
• On the one hand, to seduce and subjugate foreign audiences by painting China in 

a positive light. Four key narratives testify to this goal: the “Chinese model” (a spectacular 
economic growth, an alleged administrative efficiency and a political regime superior to liberal 
democracy); tradition, illustrated by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); benevolence, to de-
monetize the “Chinese threat” that constrains the implementation of  the Party’s foreign policy A
(and to which is then opposed the theory of  the “peaceful emergence”); and power, which has C
become China’s main appeal in the past two decades. It is embodied in its military might but T

O
also in architectural, scientific and technological achievements, as well as in the organization of  R
global events. S

• On the other hand, to infiltrate and constrain – a “harsher” category of  operations that 
do not involve seducing its opponents but rather bending them. Through infiltration, Beijing 
seeks to slowly penetrate these societies to hinder any potential action against the Party’s in-
terests. Constraining them fits within a wider dynamic: a “punitive” or “coercive” diplomacy is 
gradually becoming a systematic policy of  sanctioning any state, organization, company, or indi- A
vidual that threatens the Party’s interests. The CCP uses an incredibly wide range of  retaliatory C
measures, targeting all players in all fields – with a significant increase in these tactics since 2018. T

I
Infiltrations and constraints are usually carried out through a nexus of  intermediaries. And these O
practices target the following categories: N

- The diasporas, defined ethnically by Beijing. Beijing aims to create and sustain a feeling of  S
belonging to one nation by blurring the distinction between Chinese citizens and overseas Chinese, 
hence homogenizing very heterogeneous communities. Its goal is twofold: on the one hand, to 
control these diasporas so that they do not threaten the government – Beijing is leading what the 
NGO Freedom House described as the “most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign 
of  transnational repression in the world.” In practice, this involves surveilling these communities, 
identifying the members and infiltrating them, maintaining constant pressure on them, intimidat- C
ing, threatening, and/or constraining them one way or another, even physically assaulting them; but A
also pressuring the states where they reside to possibly getting them arrested and extradited. On S
the other hand, the Party mobilizes these communities to serve its interests, benefitting from their E
knowledge of  their country of  residence. To convince and galvanize them, the Party uses more or 
less “gentle” cooptation methods. 

- The media, Beijing explicitly aims to establish a “new world media order.” To do so, the 
government has invested €1.3 billion per year since 2008 to better control its image in the 
world, via state media that “must work to speak for the party’s will and its propositions, and C

O
protect the party’s authority and unity.” These big media companies, which include CGTN, N

CCTV, China Daily and People’s Daily, China Radio International, Xinhua and China New Ser- C
L

vice, enjoy a worldwide presence in several languages and on several continents. Still, the lack U
S

I
N
T
R
O
D of  credibility of  news reports and the Chinese media’s propagandist tone plays a key role in 
U
C the difficulties they encounter when competing with Western media and when trying to estab-
T lish themselves on the international market. Chinese state media are present on all social net-
I
O works, including those blocked in China (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram), and they 
N invest a lot of  money to increase their online audience. Several elements indicate an artificial 

inflation of  their number of  followers, a substantial part of  which could in reality be bots and 
fake accounts.

C Beijing also tries to control Chinese-speaking media abroad through different means – includ-
O ing buybacks, cooperation and/or pressure from local Chinese associations – that have proved 
N quite successful, as the CCP is in a situation of  near-monopoly. Its main leverage is not funding, 
C
E but rather the WeChat social media, whose rules push Chinese-speaking media to register on 
P its Chinese version, hence in China, where they are subjected to Party censorship. Because they 
T do not know the red lines, i.e. what is allowed, they tend to censor themselves to avoid being 
S suspended. 

To influence non-Chinese mainstream media, Beijing uses a few tools. That includes penetra-
tion (by diplomats, the “China Watch” from China Daily and content provision); acquisition (with 
consequences on the editorial line); cooptation (with compensations such as adds, all-expenses 
paid trips/training courses in China, contracts for other companies of  the same group, polit-

A ical appointments); training and networking (thousands of  journalists from all over the world 
C are trained in China, on the condition of  “correctly depicting China,” and Beijing also creates 
T professional networks via regular events); constraint; using the visa weapon against journalists 
O critical of  the regime; family members and relatives who remain in China; but also various intim-
R
S idation methods, including lawsuits (lawfare). 

Finally, Beijing is also versed in container control, influencing every step of  the global 
information supply chain, with television, web platforms (WeChat, Weibo, TikTok) and 
smartphones. Despite these many efforts however, Chinese media remain relatively unpop-
ular abroad, particularly compared to Russian media, because they focus on China and rarely 
on local issues. 

A - The diplomacy: two elements stand out. First, influence on international organizations and 
C norms: Beijing holds several key positions at the UN, provides a large portion of  the funding, 
T
I deploys classic diplomatic efforts as well as clandestine influence operations (economic and po-
O litical pressures, cooptation, coercion, and corruption) to strengthen its presence, frame debates 
N and control narratives, obtain timely endorsements, impose its agenda and influence the elabo-
S ration and interpretation of  international norms. Its revisionist goal is to “change the rules of  

the game.” The example of  the WHO during the Covid-19 pandemic, the way Beijing succeeded 
in controlling and shaping the international discussion on organ trafficking (of  which China 
was accused), in putting roadblocks on the work of  Human Rights Council, or in hijacking the 
Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations for political reasons – all show its influence, 
which also extends to regional organizations, as evidenced in the Chinese efforts to infiltrate 
European institutions and convince elites into relaying the Party’s propaganda, all in the name 

C
A of  a Chinese-European “friendship.” 
S Second, the so-called “wolf  warrior” diplomacy refers to the behavior of  the Ministry of  
E Foreign Affairs’ spokespersons and of  a dozen diplomats who are all exhibiting increased 

aggressiveness. Attacks can take traditional or newer shapes, using social media for instance, 
and an unabashed use of  invectives, reprimands or even intimidation. The Chinese position 
is to systematically counter any speech running against the official CCP line, by blurring the 
line between the CCP and China as a country-culture. While this practice has emerged pub-

C licly during the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2020, some particularly aggressive ambassadors had 
O pioneered it before, first and foremost Gui Congyou in Sweden and Lu Shaye in Canada. One 
N
C of  the symptoms of  this evolution is the “Twitterization” of  the Chinese diplomacy: between 
L
U March 2019 and March 2020, the number of  Twitter accounts belonging to embassies, consul-

ates, and Chinese ambassadors has grown by 250% – accounts often artificially amplified by a D
U

network of  fake accounts. France has also observed a radical change in the embassy’s posture C
since Lu Shaye’s arrival in Paris in 2019. T

I
Globally, this aggressive turn from Chinese diplomacy is counter-productive and has largely O

contributed to the sharp deterioration of  China’s image in the world these past years – which N

actually raised a debate within the Chinese Party-State itself. Still, there are reasons to believe that 
this is a long-lasting evolution, particularly because the aim is not so much to please us as it is to 
please Beijing. Zealous diplomats probably hope to be perceived by Beijing as particularly loyal C
and thus benefit from a career boost. O

N
- The economy: economic dependence to China is often the first leverage used by Beijing. C

Chinese economic coercion takes extremely various forms: denial of  access to the Chinese mar- E
ket, embargo, trade sanctions, and investment restrictions, but also limitations in the number of  P
Chinese tourists (because some regions depend on them), or the organization of  popular boy- T
cotts – all these have hit many countries these past few years, such as Japan, South Korea, and S

now Australia. Additionally, Beijing is increasingly making censorship a prerequisite to access 
the Chinese market, and many companies end up caving under pressure. Economic sanctions in 
the world of  professional sports are widespread and used by the CCP, with the NBA in 2019 for 
instance. Germany is another interesting case to study, because the exposure (or over-exposure) 
of  the German economy to the Chinese market is the first policy variable in Berlin’s attitude A
toward Beijing. Besides, Western companies include members of  the CCP, all potential sources C
of  information for the Party. T

O
- Politics. The overall goal is to penetrate target societies to influence public policy mechanisms. R

To do so, Beijing develops relationships directly with political parties. Through the networks woven S
by the ILD, it can identify and secure the loyalty of  individual leaders who are ready to defend Chi-
na’s image, and also learn about local political dynamics, or identify potentially exploitable sources 
of  tensions and vulnerabilities. Sustaining direct relationships with influential political figures of  a 
given country allow Beijing to infiltrate target societies, to gather official and non-official support, 
and potentially circumvent obstacles within governments by relying on opposition or “retired” 
politicians. So, in parallel to its relationships with political parties, Beijing also cultivates ties with A
individuals, and these ties can take different shapes (contacts, “useful idiots,” agents of  influence, C
or real recruits). T

I
Beijing also interferes in elections (during the past decade, China has apparently interfered O

in at least 10 elections in 7 countries). Taiwan’s case is the most documented example, but there N
were also cases of  verified interference in local elections in Canada and Australia, each time in S
the most Chinese-populated constituencies. 

- Education, universities first and foremost, is among the Party’s most important targets. In 
some places, such as Australia, universities are financially dependent on China (because Chinese 
are the biggest group of  foreign students by far), which makes these institutions less capable of  
resisting Chinese influence operations. This dependence actually pushes institutions to actively 
self-censor. Another problem is the surveillance and intimidation of  Chinese students on for- C
eign campuses, especially targeting students who are viewed as dissidents, the organization of  A
violent counter-protests, and sometimes physical assaults. Intimidations also target university S
professors and staff  members, pushing them to modify course content, teaching material and E
planned events. These actions are carried out by a minority of  Chinese students and, in some 
cases, encouraged by Chinese authorities, through embassies and/or consulates. The main tool 
used to maintain some amount of  control over Chinese students abroad and to galvanize them 
into defending China are the local branches of  the Association of  Chinese Students and Re-
searchers (CSSA). C

Another of  Beijing’s goals is to shape China Studies, by giving researchers incentives (luxuri- O
N

ous trips, part-time or full-time jobs in Chinese universities) and by pressuring them (visa denial, C
L

intimidation, pressures on publishing houses to deter them from publishing books criticizing U

D the regime, pressures on relatives in China, even kidnappings and arbitrary arrests) which usually 
U
C lead to self-censorship.
T
I The Party-State also uses universities to acquire new knowledge and technologies, either 
O openly and legally through joint-research programs, or illegally and covertly through theft or 
N espionage. To do so, China developed many recruitment programs, relying on a plethora of  “re-

cruitment stations” abroad, which are tasked to recruit and bring potential candidates to China, 
and also to collect information on scientists and research programs in the host countries. Several 

C Chinese databases contain millions of  profiles of  scientists in the world. In many cases, the work 
O of  recruited researchers actually contributes to the development of  Chinese military capacities. 
N
C Through joint programs involving researchers holding several positions, dozens of  universities 
E unintentionally help Beijing in building weapons of  mass destructions or in developing surveil-
P lance technologies that serve to oppress the Chinese population. Several related scandals broke 
T out in 2020 and 2021. 
S Finally, Confucius Institutes and Classrooms are another important player of  Chinese in-

fluence on education, and they are found everywhere in the world. And, under the pretense 
of  teaching Chinese language and culture, they can leverage influence over host institutions. 
A revenue-generating and all-expense-paid language center is difficult to refuse and it cre-
ates a form of  dependence (even subordination). Besides, Confucius Institutes (ICs) often 

A threaten academic freedom: teachers, often chosen by Beijing, must display “good political 
C and professional capacities” and “love for the motherland”; all teaching materials are pro-
T vided by Beijing and are consistent with a Chinese representation of  the world; altogether, 
O
R there are many documented cases of  self-censorship in universities hosting ICs. It also 
S creates divisions inside the teaching staff. Additionally, some think that ICs are potentially 

used to conduct espionage. For all these reasons, a growing number of  ICs have been closed 
these pasts few years. 

- Think tanks, where Beijing’s strategy is dual. Firstly, Beijing is looking to settle branches of  
Chinese think tanks abroad, like the CGTN Think Tank which has signed about fifty partnership 
agreements with foreign think tanks, or the China-CEE Institute which shows Beijing’s interest 

A in Central and Eastern European countries. These countries are also gathered in a 17+1 format 
C
T where Beijing can promote its views and initiatives and divide Europe, trying to turn these coun-
I tries against the EU. Second, Beijing exploits local intermediaries, sometimes think thanks. This 
O usually follows one of  three scenarios: occasional partners that allow Beijing’s voice to be heard 
N locally (such as IRIS and its “Paris Forum on the Belt and Road Initiative,” co-organized with the 
S Chinese embassy); circumstantial allies spreading the Party’s narratives on a regular basis (such as, 

also in France, the Fondation Prospective et Innovation), and accomplices sharing the CCP’s worldview 
and whose interests are in line with the Party (such as the Schiller Institute). Local intermediaries 
can also be publishing companies, as shown in France again by the La Route de la Soie publishing 
company. 

- Culture, first through the production and export of  cultural products such as movies or TV 
C shows, music or books, which are powerful seduction tools, as we saw with the patriotic action 
A movies Operation Red Sea and Wolf  Warrior I and II – all promoting the image of  a responsible 
S China, of  a “motherland” ready to any sacrifice to protect its citizens in peril. These cultural prod-
E ucts also demonstrate the PLA’s force projection and combat forces capacities. Chinese influence 

also reaches foreign cultural productions, including cinema, for example in Hollywood: to avoid 
upsetting Beijing and maintain an access to the Chinese market, many American film studios make 
compromises, or are even compromising themselves, while the Party-State blacklists producers, 
film directors, and actors seen as hostile to China. Film studios cut and change scenes to avoid dis-

C pleasing Beijing. The goals of  the Chinese authorities are not only negative (i.e. preventing certain 
O
N content) but also positive (i.e. promoting different content). Beijing thus requires more filming in 
C China, more “good” narratives on China, and “good” Chinese characters helping others, or even

saving the world (hence the fact that, in recent years, evil Chinese characters have disappeared from D
U

American movies). C
Cinema is not an isolated case: other cultural sectors are under pressure from Beijing and are T

I
asked to produce art that is compatible with the interests of  the CCP. Refusing access to the O
Chinese market is a systematic practice enforced against any artist criticizing the Party-State. N

Amongst other types of  pressures, Beijing hopes to push artists to change their art, or to stop 
those who show their art in other parts of  the world. It even pushes some to carry out the work 
of  Chinese censors. This is shown by several examples in museums, the video games industry C
and in theaters, where some artists have censored themselves, which is the final goal – allowing O
Beijing to win without fighting. N

C
- Information manipulation is one of  the most dynamic and documented tools. Beijing E

simulates the authenticity of  its operations by using fake accounts on social media, trolls and P
astroturfing (to simulate spontaneous popular movements) – tactics almost systematically found T
in Russian operations. These tactics were picked up by China, first on a national level to target S

its own population, and then on an international level. The Party-State carries out a “distraction 
strategy” over its entire territory to prevent collective actions that it does not generate or control 
by using a high number of  “Internet commentators” (incorrectly labelled “fifty cents’ armies”) 
to “guide” public opinions. These commenters are paid (for example $25 for a new message of  
more than 400 characters, 40 cents for reporting a negative comment that will be deleted). On A
the international stage, trolls are much more aggressive. Usually controlled by the PLA or the C
CYL, they defend, attack, feed controversies, insult, and harass. Another way to simulate authen- T

O
ticity is to ask third parties to publish content in exchange for a compensation – which Beijing R
does by cultivating content factories (freelance Chinese-speakers based in Malaysia or elsewhere S
who produce content paid between €12 and €126 per piece, depending on the length), to use AI 
more and more often to generate texts, and to use other methods such as buying one-time mes-
sages, buying an influence over an account, buying an account or a page, and finally, recruiting 
an “influencer.” 

Actually, since 2019, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have been keener on sounding the alarm 
about some campaigns from China. Dozens of  thousands of  accounts have been suspended for A
that reason. Among them was found an enduring campaign that started in 2017 and that has tar- C
geted critics of  the Chinese regime, adapting itself  to various events (Hong Kong, the pandemic, T
and the U.S. elections), surviving successive interventions from these platforms because of  their I

O
capacity to create or activate new accounts in a few days. The “Spamouflage Dragon” network N
was identified and analyzed by Graphika in four consecutive reports, which focused on dormant S
accounts and bought or stolen accounts amplifying Chinese propaganda and attacking the Unit-
ed States in Chinese or in English. Some of  these accounts had AI-generated profile pictures 
– a practice now often observed in Chinese operations on social media. Other campaigns also 
highlighted the importance of  the language used (use of  vernacular Cantonese with traditional 
Chinese characters to pose as Hong Kong citizens) and the role played by private intermediaries, 
including by digital marketing companies.

An important component of  these campaigns is that they do not only defend China: promot- C
A

ing the Chinese model involves degrading others, including liberal democracies, similarly to what S
Russian operations have been doing for years. At least three tactics are used to that end: discredit E
the opponent’s capacities; fan the flames of  controversial topics, particularly regarding racism 
and police violence in the United States; and try to create panics. 

The PLA is at the center of  these maneuvers: it uses social media for “overt” influence by 
spreading propaganda, often for dissuasion and psychological warfare, and for covert hostile 
operations against foreign targets. Many publications have shown that its researchers do not con- C
fine themselves to learning Russian and U.S. techniques, they also theorize “war through social O

N
media,” acknowledging using it for offensive purposes, including political interference. The PLA C

D also displays interest in the use of  database and artificial intelligence to “guide public opinion on

T
I - Among other tools used by Beijing in its influence operations, we found citizen movements, 
O
N particularly pro-independence movements (the Party-State has deployed the same strategy in New 

Caledonia and in Okinawa. They hope to gain control of  the economy from the inside, getting 
closer to local political leaders through several friendship associations, even manipulating informa-
tion to encourage pro-independence movements following Beijing’s interests) and pacifist move-

C ments, as shown by the No Cold War group. Chinese tourists (who make up the sector’s biggest 
O
N market, because they are the most numerous, and spend the most) are another important leverage: 
C by controlling the number of  tourists, Beijing pressures other governments. Beijing also uses tour-
E ists to spread messages and strengthen its claims in the South China Sea. Influencers are another 
P category that the Party relies on, especially Western YouTubers, used to spread Chinese propagan-
T da, whatever their personal motivations (they can be forced, bought or simply seduced). Foreign 
S academics, whose motivations are similarly diverse, can be used as well. Finally, Beijing carries out 

a so-called “hostage diplomacy,” a significant tool in power relations and influence operations, as 
evidenced by cases in Sweden, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Taiwan.

Taiwan and Hong Kong are at the forefront of  Beijing’s “political warfare,” both P
democratic and liberal strongholds over which China claims sovereignty. China’s willingness T
to intervene is made more important and facilitated by a few factors, such as a common S

language (notwithstanding a few variations), an economic dependency, and the freedom 
of  the press that is the rule in these territories – which allows China to influence local 
narratives. For all these reasons, Taiwan and Hong Kong have been outposts, the first 
ones confronted to Chinese influence operations. But for Beijing, these territories are also A
training grounds, “R&D labs” for operations that can subsequently be refined and C
implemented in other targets globally1 – such as Georgia and Ukraine were for Russian T
operations (→ p. 626). As such, they are important cases to study because they amount to O
sentinels, “canaries in the mine,”2 and indicators of  what could happen next. R

S
For a long time, one could question the similarity in the trajectories, because there are 

essential differences between Hong Kong and Taiwan on the one hand, and all of  the other 
cases on the other: Beijing does not claim sovereignty over Australia, Canada, and Sweden, 
for example, and people do not speak Chinese there. How could Taiwan and Hong Kong 
be seen as relevant precedents for these countries and for the rest of  the world? Yet, two 
things have happened in recent years: one, intensified attacks against Hong Kong and A

C
Taiwan (so much so that, since 2019, Twitter and Facebook have formally attributed to T
Beijing dismantled operations on their platforms)3 and, second, some tactics, hitherto I
limited to Taiwan and Hong Kong, have been extended to other targets. A difference O

N
remains, admittedly, but in the intensity of  the operations, not in their nature. Currently, S
there is no doubt that Beijing implements tactics against these two targets that will later be 
used against the rest of  the world. 

The first step in the expansion of  Chinese operations occurred in Australia and 
New Zealand. Retrospectively, from a European or North American perspective, these 
two countries appear to have been used as “guinea pigs” of  Chinese interference – John 
Garnaud uses the same metaphor of  the “canary in a coal mine” to describe their respective C
situations and that of  Australia4 – because they had noted very early on the implemen- A
tation of  tactics subsequently used elsewhere in the world. Why these two countries? S

Chinese influence operations had already targeted Taiwan, its institutions, political par- P
ties, civil society before, even when Kuomintang (KMT) – which is favorable to mainland T

S
China (One China policy) – ruled the country, for example during Ma Ying-jeou’s presidency 
(2008-2016). Truth be told, the United Front has always been very active in Taiwan.1 But 
these maneuvers intensified after the Sunflower Student Movement that saw students 
occupy the legislative Yuan, the Taiwanese parliament, in March and April 2014: at that 
point, Beijing certainly came to the conclusion that Ma did not have enough control over A
the situation to implement a pro-Chinese agenda. Their concerns were confirmed two years C
later when, in 2016, Tsai Ing-wen was elected president and her Democratic Progressive T
Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan independence, won a majority of  the seats in parlia- O

R
ment. S

Since 2016, cross-strait relations have deteriorated, and China’s “political war-
fare” in Taiwan has become harsher. As J. Michael Code explained, the Chinese strategy 
in Taiwan usually consists in combining incentives (to “win hearts and minds”) and coer-
cive measures to constrain decision-makers while weakening democratic institutions. The 
DPP’s rise to power pushed Beijing to review the balance between these two poles.2 The A
hope of  seducing Taiwanese people is now relatively faint,3 first because the feeling C
of  belonging to the Chinese nation has deteriorated in recent years, so much so that only T
2% of  Taiwanese inhabitants define themselves as only Chinese compared to 62.6% as I
solely Taiwanese.4 Then, Xi Jinping’s martial speech in January 2019, which mentioned a O

N
potentially forced reunification if  necessary, and the Hong Kong crisis during the summer S
and the fall of  that year acted as powerful repellents. China now focuses on coercive 
measures. They have become easier to implement because, during Ma Ying-jeou’s eight 
years in power, “cross-Strait ties were opened up […] his administration made little effort to 
increase its counterintelligence capabilities in a manner commensurate with the new oppor-
tunities for penetration from China that resulted from the loosened restrictions. That cre-
ated a number of  new avenues for the CCP to penetrate, influence, and corrode Taiwanese C
institutions.”5 Taiwan perfectly illustrates the Chinese “Machiavellian moment,” A
i.e. the conviction that it is safer to be feared than to be loved (→ p. 619). S

U Overall, the Taiwanese society is particularly vulnerable to Chinese operations 
C for a plethora of  reasons, and first because China claims sovereignty over this ter-
T
I ritory where the same language, or even languages, are spoken. Mandarin (Guoyu in 
O
N Taiwanese) is the official language but the mother tongue of  less than 20% of  the pop-

ulation; 70% of  the population speaks Taiwanese, which is essentially derived from the 
Minnan dialect, 10 to 15% of  the population speaks Hakka, and 2% an aboriginal language. 

C Young Taiwanese born after 1990 are very attached to democratic and liberal values – but 
O the risk is that they are not mobilized during elections, particularly among those working in 
N Taipei who must go back to their district of  origin to vote.
C
E Another weakness is that the Taiwanese society is polarized around several issues. 
P The polarization is first reflected in Taiwan’s relationship with China (pro-unification/
T pro-independence) even if  this divide has lessened in the past few years. The population 
S is also divided over societal questions such as gay marriage, pension reform, agriculture, 

and so on. The media landscape is likewise polarized, as it reflects the society and 
is also largely infiltrated by Beijing. The Online Media Fractionalization indicator devel-
oped by the Digital Society Project (DSP)6 showed that “major online media outlets in 
Taiwan provide very different presentations of  the same events. Since Taiwanese people 

A
C consume online media quite extensively […] the Chinese disinformation strategy and 
T resulting online information fractionalization is likely to have a detrimental impact on 
O Taiwan’s democracy.”7 
R
S Taiwanese media also suffer from a concentration of  capital, from a race for clickbait 

(a “tabloidization” of  outlets) and overwork (some journalists having to produce 4 to 
8 articles a day).8 As a result, journalists do not take enough time to cross-check their 
sources or to verify information. J. Michael Cole, who worked at the Taipei Times – owned 
by the biggest press holding on the island – for more than seven years, explained that this 
“very poor tradition of  fact checking, or double-checking, or corroborating information 

A […] makes Taiwan ripe for the injection of  disinformation in its bloodstream.”9 Finally, 
C
T the verticality of  relationships inside a newsroom, which stiffles young reporters, and 
I the lack of  incentive (or time) for investigative journalism are additional vulnerabilities.10 
O Besides, Taiwan has the second highest social network penetration in the world 
N
S (88%)11: 83% of  the population gets its information online and 59% through social net-

works.12 In other words, Taiwanese people are very “connected,” most of  them have an 
account on one or several social media platforms, and they are incidentally particularly 
vulnerable to the disinformation that circulates on these networks. All these reasons 
explain why, according to several reports, Taiwan is one of  the countries most at risk 
of  disinformation in the world.13

That being said, Rush Doshi insists that it is not only about disinformation and propa- D
U

ganda. In Taiwan more than anywhere else, Beijing’s goal is to “control every step of  C

the information supply chain. Targets range from those that create content (journalists T
I

and researchers) to the institutions that publish and validate it (television stations and wire O
N

services) and, finally, to the platforms that often provide the final outreach to consumers 
(social media websites and digital TV infrastructure).”14 We will see that Beijing uses both 
the carrot and the stick, both positive measures (incentives, rewards) and negative C
actions (intimidations, threats, sanctions) at each of  these stages. O

More broadly, in applying the full repertoire of  “political warfare” tactics, the CCP N
has two main goals in Taiwan: first, weaken its democratic institutions, including C

E
elections, and the trust, morale, and resistance of  the population. Second, divide the soci- P
ety by exacerbating its weaknesses: Chinese state media ostensibly want to “lebanize”15 T
Taiwan: they strive to pit communities against each other, target the country’s cohesion, S
including its territorial cohesion by pitting regions against each other and paying particular 
attention to the islands. To reach that goal, the Party uses two types of  resources: traditional 
Chinese media and local relays.

Traditional media stands for the media that existed before the advent of  the Internet and 
of  new communication technologies, mainly in print (press and books), radio and television 
formats – even though they have also developed new digital platforms since then. Among 
the traditional Chinese media, we distinguish the traditional (or generalist) media which 
cover all sorts of  topics and do not target one particular audience, for instance the news- A
papers Global Times and People’s Daily and media outlets specifically dedicated to Taiwan, C
such as the Voice of  the Straits radio, the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation and the Haifeng T

A. The use of  conventional media

Chinese conventional media are a powerful vector to spread the Party’s propa-
ganda, but they only exert a limited influence on Taiwan and on Taiwanese people. 
Apart from the radio, (that can be freely listened to if  it is aired close enough to Taiwan) it 
is impossible for other channels (press, television) to open in Taiwan without the approval C
of  Taiwanese authorities. This is the reason why radio has historically been the preferred A
mean of  diffusion of  the Party’s propaganda in Taiwan, being a rather inexpensive tool that S

E
is easy to set up.16

U Nowadays, Chinese television channels such as CCTV or CGTN seem to have a 
C limited potential for influence because they do not broadcast in Taiwan, and even though 
T
I Taiwanese inhabitants can access their content online. But this latter option requires active 
O
N engagement from viewers, unlikely to be taken given the current context of  relative distrust 

toward Chinese narratives and the increased competition for the viewers’ attention in the 
current media landscape.17 

C With the Internet, Chinese newspapers can offer web versions of  print articles, mak-
O ing sharing or viewing content particularly easy online, regardless of  where readers are. 
N While their content is easy to access, it is not the most attractive to Taiwanese 
C
E audiences who enjoy a large variety of  national newspapers. Besides, Chinese news-
P papers are not always available in traditional characters. Taiwanese people can generally 
T read simplified Chinese characters, but most prefer traditional characters, out of  conve-
S nience or by choice, given the simplified characters’ political connotations, as they are 

immediately linked to the language of  the CCP. Hence, Chinese articles with a version 
in traditional Chinese characters are more likely to be read by Taiwanese audiences than 
articles solely written in simplified Chinese characters. As a result, many newspapers 
have a web version in traditional characters, for example the Xinhua press agency and 

A
C the PLA Daily.18 The People’s Daily, the China Daily and the Guangming Daily do not appear 
T to offer it. However, almost all offer an English version for their international audiences 
O and some – such as Xinhua and the People’s Daily – have an entire section dedicated to 
R
S Taiwanese news. 

Radio programs are now also available online. And, very early on, the main Chinese 
networks, such as CNR and CRI, set up networks dedicated to Taiwanese audi-
ences. In 1954, as nationalist and communist forces were still fighting, the CNR had 
already opened two channels for Taiwanese audiences. The “Chinese Voice”, or CNR-5, 
now covers cross-strait and Taiwanese news in Mandarin. The “Shenzhou Voice”, or 

A CNR-6, offers cultural programs in Mandarin, Hakka, and Minnan dialects.19 The latter 
C
T two dialects are the most widely used languages in Taiwan and in the Chinese province 
I of  Fujian, which faces the island from the other side of  the strait. Chinese media 
O often claim that these programs are highly successful in Taiwan: they recently 
N
S reported approximately 2 million Taiwanese listeners.20 Likewise, CRI, which was cre-

ated in 1949, developed programs in various dialects, including Minnan and Hakka, for 
people of  Chinese descent. Today, the radio station “Chinese Voice in the World” offers 
programs in these two dialects as well as in languages from Guangzhou, Chaozhou, and 
Wenzhou.21

In addition to the two radio programs dedicated to Taiwan, the CNR set up a web 
C portal, HelloTaiwan – or Nihao Taiwan in 2000 to reach a younger audience. The 
A stated objective is to promote China-Taiwan relations and to allow people of  Chinese

increasingly defined Taiwanese identity. See Voir Kat Devlin, Christine Huang, “In Taiwan, Views of  Mainland

descent to “better understand” China. Chinese sources say that the website is visited D
U

around 12 million times each day, which would make HelloTaiwan one of  the main plat- C

forms for Chinese propaganda in Taiwan. This platform is part of  the nexus of  T
I

informational operations within which we found units of  the PLA’s Base 311, O
N

such as the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC) and Voices of  the 
Strait (VTS).22 In fact, Zhang Xida, a HelloTaiwan and CNR journalist, was found 
spreading false information on YouTube and Facebook through videos in which he pre- C
tended to be Taiwanese (→ p. 467). O

Finally, publications from major publishing companies in China such as the N
ones tied to Beijing University (北京大学出版社), East China Normal University (华 C

E
东师范大学出版社), the Red Flag University (红旗出版社) or the Chinese Academy P
for Social Sciences Press (社会科学文献出版社) can be accessed from Taiwan, at T
least on the main book vendors’ websites such as Bokelai (博客来).23 Books do not S
allow reacting on breaking news as easily as newspapers, radio, and television can. But 
they can help shape the long-term intellectual landscape. Many Chinese initiatives thus 
promote cross-strait relationships in the publishing sector, which is considered 
as playing an important role in the pursuit of  the “cultural fusion” between Taiwan 
and China.24 The goal reflects Beijing’s ambition to influence or even control A

C
narratives and ideas in the Taiwanese intellectual world. An organization subor- T
dinate to the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO → p. 84), the Jiuzhou Center for Cultural O
Communication (九州文化传播中心), organized a cross-strait forum for the pub- R

S
lishing industry in 2018, together with the Fujian Academy for Social Sciences, to 
celebrate thirty years of  cooperation in the sector.25 

In Taiwan, structures such as the Tonsan (唐山出版社) and Renjan (人間出版
社) publishing companies, the Observer (觀察) and Yuanwang (遠望) journals, or The 
Commercial Press Taiwan (臺灣商務印書館) have already participated in this type of  
cross-strait forums; some of  their leaders pleaded for a better diffusion of  Chinese A
books in Taiwan during these events.26 Some actions are even instigated by Taiwanese C

T
people, such as the forum organized by the dean of  the private Nanhua University in I
Taiwan (南华大学),27 which has convened every year since 2005 around themes such O
as the construction of  China’s soft power, cultural fusion, or the impact of  digitaliza- N

S
tion on the publishing sector.28

While conventional media are not the most efficient in decisively influencing 
the Taiwanese audience nowadays, they still play an important role in relaying 
the official Chinese narrative. Incidentally, the more a narrative is repeated, the more

U

to newspapers and TV, it can be freely broadcast from China to Taiwan, requires little C

financial resources and staff  and it can interact with listeners who can participate.36 T
I

Besides, the human voice, as opposed to the neutrality that comes with a written piece, O
N

is seen as being more persuasive. Hence the value in airing recorded messages of  
support such as “Strength to Wuhan!” or celebrating the solidarity between the 
two shores during the Covid-19 pandemic using people with a Taiwanese accent. C
These help persuade listeners that China was supported by the Taiwanese pop- O
ulation.37 N

Radio is a media that also draws its strength from its capacity to respond quickly to an C
E

event. Since audiences are always more marked by the first version of  events that P
they hear than by subsequent versions – a cognitive psychology bias known as anchor- T
ing – VTS’ former director Liu Linlan (柳林岚) claimed that politically-aimed radios S
such as VTS are playing a crucial part in quickly reacting to impose the adequate 
version of  facts first, particularly on topics pertaining to the cross-strait relationship.38 
In 2005, she wrote that VTS’ mission was to improve knowledge and understanding of  
reforms and modernization in China and various types of  exchanges between the two 
sides of  the strait, to contribute to reinforcing the feeling of  fraternity between popula- A

C
tions and the feeling of  belonging to the Chinese Nation, but also to promote Chinese T
culture and values.39 O

a. Using “voice carriers” to reach a wider audience
It seems that VTS launched an offensive to penetrate the Taiwanese media landscape 

after its 50th birthday celebrations. Since the beginning of  the 2010s, VTS has indeed sought 
to build a network of  collaborators in some Taiwanese media to use them as “voice 
carriers” (借台唱).40 By letting its stories be aired to already-established audiences, VTS A
is widening the reach of  its messages in an increasingly competitive media landscape.41 For C
example, VTS signed a cooperation agreement with Libra Radio (非凡音联播网) in 2008 T
that provided for shared programs, the transmission of  Libra Radio’s audience measure- I

O
ments to VTS, and for the broadcasting of  VTS’ news reports on Libra Radio for forty N
minutes every day.42 Libra Radio broadcast on the Matsu Islands, north of  Taiwan, as well S
as on the coastal cities of  Fujian.43 Hence, its audience is both Taiwanese and Chinese. 
VTS also targets Chinese who maintain close ties with Taiwan because, if  they are 
convinced by the content of  the shows, they can become efficient relays sharing these

U ideas with Taiwanese people.44 In addition to local radios, VTS has also partnered with 
C local newspapers. According to its former director, Zhong Zhigang (钟志刚), VTS regu-
T
I larly cooperates with several Taiwanese publications such as Want Daily, (旺報), the Taiwan 
O
N Daobao (臺灣導報), or the Liberty Times (自由時報) in the hopes of  increasing its influence 

in Taiwan.45 

C b. Using local dialects for a rapprochement
O
N The Minnan and Hakka dialects are spoken on both sides of  the strait and are 
C used to bring the continent and the island closer together. Taiwanese people speak 
E mandarin – calling it guoyu (國語) rather than putonghua (普通话) as Chinese do – but 
P more than 70% of  the population speaks Minnan and around 15% belong to the Hakka 
T
S ethnic group. As such, collaborating with Taiwanese radio broadcasting in Minnan 

or Hakka was identified as an efficient tool to penetrate the Taiwanese society.46 
In 2009, VTS partnered with six Taiwanese radios broadcasting in Hakka to create a 
group of  channels operating in Taiwan’s region.47 According to former VTS director 
Zhang Zhigang, this action is considered to have marked the actual entry of  continental 

A China into the Taiwanese radio environment.48 VTS aired its first show, co-hosted with 
C a Taiwanese radio station, Formosa Hakka Radio Station (寶島客家廣播電台), in May 
T
O 2009.49 VTS joined the Hakka Radio Cooperation network (客 属电台协作网) created 
R by the China Radio and Television Association (CRTA, 中国广播电视 协会)50 in 2012. 
S Similarly, in the Minnan dialect, VTS joined the Broadcast Cooperative Network for 

the Minnan Dialect (闽南话广播协作网), also created by the CRTA, in 2010. The five 
remaining members of  this network are the Taiwan Broadcasting Center of  the China 
National Radio (中央人民广播电台对台湾广播中心), the Southeast Broadcasting 
Corporation (东南广播公司), the Minnan Voice Broadcasting of  the Xiamen Media 

A Group station (厦门广播电视集团闽南之声广播), the Citong Voice Broadcasting of  
C the Quanzhou Radio station (泉州人民广播电台刺桐之声广播) and the Zhangzhou 
T Radio Station (漳州人民 广播电台).51

N c. Diversifying communication supports
S Originally, VTS was a traditional organ of  propaganda, but after more than 60 years, 

the old radio station had to evolve to keep pace with new technologies and to adapt to 
the needs of  the new generations to maintain an influence. One of  the major compo-
nents of  this strategy was to diversify its supports of  communication. In 2000, VTS 
set up a website at about the same time HelloTaiwan was created (你好台灣), and both 
hoped to target younger audiences. The website allowed VTS to adopt different sup-

ports: articles, podcasts, and videos of  variable length, in order to target and adapt D
U

its content to different audiences. In August 2013, VTS even published the first online C

video streaming channel aimed at Taiwan: the Huaxia Jingdian ( T
華夏經典網絡電 I

台).52 In 2015, two years after former VTS director Liu Linlan published an article on O
N

the important opportunities offered by WeChat53 as a powerful application for mes-
saging, information sharing and services, VTS created an account on the platform.54 
The “New Media” (新媒体) – WeChat, Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, Plurk,55 attracted C
a lot of  attention, as evidenced by the high number of  articles from VTS affiliates and O
others on the topic. They are a significant challenge because they intensify competition N
for the public’s attention but also an opportunity because they are additional tools to C

E
penetrate and manipulate the Taiwanese “public opinion environment.”56 In his P
2013 speech at the National Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work (全国宣 T
传思想工作会议), Xi Jinping claimed that the Internet had become the main fighting S
ground of  the war on public opinions and that victory there was crucial.57 Ultimately, 
in line with the secretary general of  the Party, VTS has been striving to win the war on 
public opinions. 

d. Turning VTS into a mass media A
C

If  the diversification of  the means of  communication was necessary, so was the evo- T
O

lution of  the content of  the messages. Mid-2000s, executives thought that VTS was too R
specialized and that it needed to become a mainstream or “mass” media.58 This was S
considered to be the most efficient way to spread propaganda in Taiwan. Answering the 
question: “how to lower [the target audience’s] mistrust and hostility?” former director 
Lui Linlan wrote in 2005 that “there is only one way to do that. Communication toward 
Taiwan has to be conducted through mass media. Propaganda needs to be integrated in a 
real radio [programming]. Circulating propaganda must be implemented in a subtle A
fashion, without leaving traces. Only then will [the target audience] let its guard C
down, forget you are United Front, be willing to listen to your programs, and they T
will ultimately trust the broadcast content.”59 In other words, by becoming a mass I

O
media, VTS aims to drown its propaganda in a flow of  information, sneaking it to N
the audience. S

U e. Adapting its message to the target audience
C
T Likewise, VTS executives were aware of  the need to use the target audience’s language in 
I
O order to fulfill their goals. This meant adapting the content to local specificities, for example 
N by speaking the audience’s specific dialect, but also adapting the message to different age 

groups, with a style that “spoke” to young people. On the matter of  military-related propa-
ganda toward Taiwan (对台军事宣传), its former director Zhong Zhigang explained that 

C a communication strategy tailored to each identified audience had to be adopted. 
O
N He highlighted three such categories: ordinary Taiwanese soldiers, pro-independence 
C forces, and the Taiwanese population. According to Zhong, a Taiwanese soldier’s only 
E concern was “not knowing for whom he is fighting” (不知为谁作战) and, for that reason, 
P he described them as having only “vague” patriotic aspirations (国家民族精神模糊). As 
T
S a result, the PLA’s communication strategy needed to guide them positively, and to lead 

them toward the “truth.” However, he noted that a harsher tone needed to be used against 
pro-independence Taiwanese forces. The PLA’s commitment and willingness to fight had 
to be made blatant and dissuasive narratives chosen. Finally, the civil population had to be 
told in a reassuring and educational tone that the PLA’s mission was only to protect its fel-

A low citizens.60 Here, Zhong relied on basic principles of  psychological warfare, and made 
C them more prominent in public opinion warfare. 
T

R f. Quickly reacting
S Former VTS directors Liu Linlan and Zhong Zhigang have insisted on the importance 

of  reacting quickly and efficiently to impose a specific version of  events and frame 
the debate, and for the “PLA’s good image to penetrate the head of  the population in 
Taiwan.”61 Given that VTS gives a lot of  importance to military and defense-related issues 
– several of  its programs are actually dedicated to them62 – Zhong pointed to a few exam-

A ples of  news that needed to be followed and well-covered, such as the PLA’s peacekeeping 
C operations abroad, the protection of  China’s sovereignty in the South China Sea, joint 
T
I Sino-Russian military exercises, and news on flagship technologies such as the J-20 fighter 
O aircraft or the Liaoning aircraft carrier. However, this did not only apply to military issues. 
N When a columnist for the Taiwan Daobao published an op-ed titled “[the] Chinese dream 
S and the Taiwanese dream of  independence are both just dreams,63” VTS responded in the 

same breath with articles such as “[the] Chinese dream is the highest common denominator 
between both sides of  the Strait – a discussion with M. Mo Shangsang”64 and “[how] could 
one compare the Taiwanese dream of  independence with the Chinese dream”65; both were 
published on its own website and on Taiwan Daobao.66 We were unable to find the colum-
nists’ publication, but VTS op-eds were still online years later.

a precious legacy from centuries of  imperial dynasties, and as still contributing to the E
economic development of  the regions it connects.67 In 2013, CHBC partnered with P
the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (中国航天科技集团公司), T
the Fujian Provincial Development and Reform Commission (福建省发改委) and the S

Fujian Association for Science and Technology (福 建省科协) to organize a series of  
events on the “space dream”- (航天梦); according to that narrative, the “dream” 
could only be achieved if  it was taken up by Chinese people on both sides of  the 
Strait.68 In a very different field, CHBC has organized cultural competitions, such as A
the ocean-themed new songs contest for students on both sides of  the strait, which C
took place in Fuzhou in 2013.69 T

CHBC also sponsors events that contribute to the promotion of  China, even if  it O
R

does not directly organize them. In 2019, CHBC was among the seven sponsors of  the third S
edition of  the Chinese classical poetry recitation competition organized by Aiyinsitan FM 
Radio (爱音斯坦FM) on both sides of  the strait, Hong Kong, and Macao (海峡两岸暨香
港 澳门地区中华经典诗文诵读大赛).70 In 2012, CHBC sent about forty of  its journal-
ists to interview a hundred China-based Taiwanese entrepreneurs to collect their stories as 
part of  an initiative of  the China Association for Promotion of  Chinese Culture (中华文
化发展促进会). Testimonies were gathered during a five-month fieldwork and presented A

C
during the closing ceremony in Wenzhou. Wang Shu, CHBC’s director at the time, and a T
member of  the military and Base 311 commander, said this action, called “Chinese Cultural I
Development Strategies – Four Cultural Salons Across the Taiwan Strait” (大陆台商财富 O

N
故事), was an opportunity to show the contribution of  Taiwanese people to the economic S
development of  the cities they settled in and to reveal the “real” family links between them 
and the local population.71

The flagship event to which CHBC takes part is the Forum for the Development 
of  the Chinese Culture (中华文化发展论坛). This forum aims to strengthen ties 
between China and Taiwan and to promote the Chinese culture, in other words to 
increase China’s soft power. This forum, which was called “Strategy for the Development C

Each edition has a specific theme. The 2019 edition, co-organized with the Internet 
Society of  China, focused on “Internet culture and media communication” (网络文化
与媒体传播). Executive Director Chen Guojun (陈国军), who is also a member of  

A the military, spoke for CHBC at the event and called for the media to guide the popu-
C lation on both sides of  the Strait in recognizing China’s “real history” and reject-
T ing independence movements; he reminded his audience that modern dissemination

youth” (文化创新与青年担当) respectively. N

b. The youth: A key target group P
The youth is a key target group because it embodies the future of  cross-strait T

S
relations. Some of  CHBC’s shows are incidentally explicitly conceived for young 
audiences, as with “Liang’an qingnianhui” (两岸青年汇). CHBC president Qui Yu, 
otherwise known as General-Major Yue Lei, pointed out in a 2017 speech that the 
youth on both sides of  the Strait had a role to play in the “protection of  Chinese cul-
ture.”78 CHBC regularly organizes actions specifically dedicated to young Taiwanese A
people, with the goal of  making them like Chinese culture, to instill a sense of  pride C
in them as part of  the same Chinese nation, and ultimately to strengthen a sense of  T

O
belonging. R

In 2018, for example, and together with the Taiwan Affairs Office of  the PRC’s State S
Council, CHBC organized an exchange program for 50 Taiwanese students and 
10 Chinese students to show them opportunities in the academic and business 
sectors in several Chinese mainland towns.79 CBHC had previously co-organized an 
Exchange Forum for Taiwanese students wishing to study or work in China (
台生大陆求学就业交流汇) in 2015.80 According to its president, Qiu Yu, this forum A
aimed to inform young Taiwanese people about opportunities in China, to offer them C
support and to create a communication platform between the two sides of  the Strait. T
Similarly, CHBC invited around twenty Taiwanese students to discover Qinghai in July I

O
2016, in the hopes of  fostering exchanges between that province and Taiwan. An exec- N
utive from the Qinghai–Tibet railway company (青藏铁路公司) told them about the S
company’s history and its weight on the socio-economic development of  these two 
huge provinces located in Western China.81 These actions targeting the youth show 
that Chinese are betting on the long-term: to shape the youth’s opinions in such 
a way that it favors Taiwan’s reunification with China, which would win back the island 
without using military might.

N organizations directly affiliated to Base 311, but also the media partners such as the Want

N Association for Promotion of  Chinese Culture (CAPCC, 中华文化发展促进会), the 
C All-China Federation of  Taiwan Compatriots (中华全国台湾同胞联谊会) or also the 
E Collaborative Innovation Center for Peaceful Development of  Cross-Strait Relations (两
P 岸关 系和平发展协同创新中心). The CAPCC was created in 2001 and it is now seen 
T
S as the PLA’s main platform for informal exchanges with Taiwan. It is probably run by 

the former General Political Department’s Liaison Office of  the CMC. In fact, two general 
officers in that bureau held senior positions in the CAPCC (→ p. 124).82 Additionally, the 
All-China Federation of  Taiwan Compatriots was created in 1981 and acts as a “bridge and 
link” between Taiwanese people, the CCP, and the Chinese government.83 The Collaborative 

A Innovation Center for Peaceful Development of  Cross-Strait Relations is another organi-
C zation: created at the initiative of  Xiamen University in 2013, the center brings together 
T the University of  Fudan, Fujian Normal University and the Chinese Academy of  Social

co-hosted by a Chinese CHBC anchor and a Taiwanese Happy Radio anchor. The show D
U

was called Huaguang Kuaile Easy Go (华广快乐EZGO) – Huaguang referring to CBHC C

and Kuaile to Happy Radio. The hour was divided between a serious part dedicated to T
I

exchanging views on issues affecting both sides of  the Strait, and a lighter part dealing with O
N

Chinese culture, travel stories, or food. Exchanging views in such manner was meant to 
show that, although there are disagreements between the two sides of  the Strait, it 
was still possible to understand each other and to share a common history and cul- C
ture.85 CHBC also wanted to be able to share the Chinese narrative to the audience of  its O
Taiwanese collaborator. Happy Radio is indeed the second largest radio network in Taiwan, N
after UFO Radio (飛碟聯播網). The show was first aired on three of  Happy Radio’s sta- C

E
tions before being extended to the seven channels, covering the whole Taiwanese territory.86 P
This partnership was the result of  a rapprochement initiated by CBHC before 2010: CHBC T
had invited Happy Radio’s executive director to events in China, later to visit CHBC’s head- S

quarters and to collaborate on some occasional projects. CHBC now seeks to increase its 
visibility in Taiwan, but also to increase China’s visibility (增进对大陆的理解认知) and 
reduce anti-China opposition (消除对大 陆的对抗) there.87

3. Haifeng C

T
Haifeng is the publishing company of  the PLA Base 311 (→ p. 106). According to O

the description of  its activities on the Tianyancha trade database, Haifeng publishes pro- R
paganda writing and illustrated books for Taiwan.88 The topics vary: politics, economy, S

history, law, culture, literature, arts. For instance, in 2011, the Haifeng publishing house 
won the second edition of  the publishing award the Chinese government awards every 
three years (第二届中国出版政府奖), for its book Presentation of  the cities in China (中国
城市巡礼).89 Published in 2009, for the 60th anniversary of  the PRC, the book praised 
the successes and developments of  modern Chinese cities since the economic reform. It A
was commended for including Taipei, Hong Kong, and Macao, thus taking a “true family C

T
photo” of  Chinese cities. I

Several of  Haifeng’s books promote national reunification, such as A Call from the Two O
Shores: Peaceful Reunification of  the Motherland (海峡两岸的呼唤:和平统一祖国) published N
in 1999 by Xu Haoran (徐浩然), a former aid to Chiang Ching-kuo and member of  the S

Kuomintang’s revolutionary committee in the Jiangxi province.90 That same year, Lee Teng-

published a Taiwanese Population Stories Series (台湾百姓故事丛书), a trilogy, in 2015.

军队心理战战例选评)109 and Psychological Warfare Leaflets (心理战传单), written by three O
authors in 2009, including a professor at the National Defense University.110 N

Taiwanese people theoretically have access to books published by Haifeng inso- C
E

far as they can be found on the websites of  Taiwanese book vendors.111 However, the P
actual appeal of  these books is doubtful, given that they are displayed on these websites T
without any picture or description, and they are relatively expansive. In addition, Haifeng S
books are published in simplified characters, whereas Taiwanese people are used to tra-
ditional characters. Here, the lack of  efforts undertaken to market and promote them 
is surprising. Haifeng does not even have a website dedicated to its products, a catalogue 
or at least a system to present its new books to readers who might be interested in them. 
The publishing company did create a WeChat account in which it regularly publishes A

C
some short texts, but WeChat is not the preferred social network in Taiwan. With book that T
are not easily discoverable on the Taiwanese market and that do not necessarily correspond O
to the target audience’s tastes and expectations, we can question Haifeng Publishing’s R

S
actual ability to conduct “propaganda toward Taiwan” (对台宣传). 

a. The events it organizes involve the same galaxy
However, Haifeng’s actions go beyond publishing books: it also regularly takes part 

in events promoting Chinese culture and cross-strait relations. CHBC, VTS, and Haifeng A
often co-organize events together, such as a 2015 ceremony commemorating the 70th C
anniversary of  the end of  the Japanese War, which was attended by Jiao Honghui et Ai T
Songru, otherwise known as Ai Ke;112 or a cultural event organized in 2013 under the aegis I

O
of  the CAPCC by CHBC, VTS, CNR and Haifeng.113 N

Haifeng’s flagship project seems to be the “Photographers of  the Two Shores,” an S
initiative it has organized yearly since 2002 with the Photographic Society of  Taipei (
台北摄影学会, founded in 1956). It puts together a trip with a group of  Chinese and 
Taiwanese photographers to visit several cities and territories displaying Chinese wealth,

O
N Since leaving their respective positions, Jiao Honghui has continued to take part to the trips 

as co-president of  the Fujian Photographers’ Association and Cai Denghui as a member 
of  the Taiwan Cross-Strait Peace, Culture and Arts Alliance (台湾两岸 和平文化艺术联

O associations from the Chinese province of  Yunnan and the city of  Wuhan and from the 
N Taiwanese city of  Tainan, and the counties of  Nantou and Hsinchu in 2016 for instance. 
C
E Among the participants we also found several media. In 2016, it included the China News 
P Service, the Chinese daily Sanmin (三明日报), and the Taiwanese magazines Dujia Baodao (獨
T 家報導) and Lianyi Sheying (聯藝攝影). The academic field was also included that year, with 
S the participation of  Cai Denglong, professor at the National Taiwan University of  Sport 

and National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi (蔡登龍), and a teacher from the Chiayi 
Industrial Vocational High School. Finally, these Haifeng initiatives have often been carried 
out with the full support and occasional participation of  the CAPCC.114

C
T
O II. From the inside: local intermediaries
R
S Beijing goes around the Taiwanese central government by coopting a high num-

ber of  local intermediaries: political parties, media, PR agencies, business persons, civil 
society organizations, or cultural institutions working on both sides of  the strait, as well as 
diehard “blue” military communities, brought up with the myth of  an unavoidable reuni-
fication. These local intermediaries are crucially important, first because they act as inter-

A preters allowing cultural mediation; and second because they are already established and 
C thus benefit from an immediately available credibility and audience. By using them, not 
T only does Beijing cover its tracks (particularly because local intermediaries do not make 
I
O linguistic mistakes that might give away their foreign origins), it also increases its chances 
N of  having an impact because the Taiwanese population will be reached out by people that 
S it knows, in its language, with its own cultural references. “China just has to pay for these 

local groups to do the work for them,” a member of  government summed up.115

A. Taiwanese media

C The party is involved in an overt “media war on Taiwan,” the strategic goals of  
A which were laid out in 2004 by President Hu Jintao, at the fiftieth anniversary of  the first 
S broadcast of  the Chinese National Radio in Taiwan: ‘‘Entering the Island, Entering 
E the Household, and Entering the Mind (of  the people)’’ (“入 岛、入户、入心”).116 

In the early 2000s, China was mostly using outside media, from Hong Kong especially, to 
try and influence the Taiwanese public opinion. Beijing then took on Lenin’s idea: “the

easiest way to capture a fortress is from within.”117 Going through local intermediaries D
U

is all the more necessary since, contrary to Hong Kong, Taiwan forbids entities or individ- C

uals from mainland China from buying Taiwanese media without governmental approval. T
I

Similarly, Taiwanese media cannot publish advertisements from the Chinese state. Beijing O
N

thus needs to rely on local intermediaries. 
This strategy of  capture from within made headways during the presidency of  

Ma Ying-jeou (KMT, 2008-2016) as he promoted a deeper economic integration C
between Taiwan and mainland China. It facilitated the penetration of  Taiwanese media O
by Beijing and, incidentally, self-censorship. This was confirmed by subsequent reports on N
global media freedom: Taiwan’s score has sharply deteriorated since 2008-2009118 – even C

E
though it remains #1 in Asia. RSF’s choice of  setting up its East Asian office in Taipei P
was telling: Hong Kong had been an option until the Umbrella Revolution, after which T
Reporters without Borders reconsidered its decision given Chinese interference.119 S

Huang Jaw-nian came up with a theoretical model to explain China’s influence on 
Taiwanese media,120 combining the “commercialization of  censorship” model 
developed by Kurlantzick and Link121 and Wu Jieh-min (吳介民)’s “China Factor” mod-
el.122 According to the first, the CCP has not only used traditional methods, but also out-
sourced censorship to private media companies by threatening them when they refused to A

C
comply, which increased the tendency of  Chinese media to censor themselves. According T
to the latter model, economic dependence is Beijing’s main tool of  political influence on O
other countries. Combining both, Huang Jaw-nian focuses on mechanisms through R

S
which the Chinese government exports its censorship, including by outsourcing it 
to foreign private media companies. He subsequently distinguished three steps: first, 
make the target conntry economically dependent; then co-opt private media, either 
providing services to them (financial and advertising resources, capitalization, access to the 
Chinese market) or through threats to close them down; finally, implement and normal-
ize self-censorship within the media landscape of  these countries to shape the narrative A
in favor of  China. The author predicted that “a media company outside China will exercise C

T
self-censorship on Chinese-sensitive topics when it becomes commercially tied with the I
Chinese market”123 – an hypothesis that Huang confirmed by looking at Taiwan. Here, four O
specific levers can be distinguished. N

S

1. Access to the Chinese market

Taiwan became economically tied to China during the 2000s, and after the 2010 
free trade agreement was signed. But the process had begun earlier: China has been 
Taiwan’s main trade partner since 2005, replacing the U.S. and Japan, its first export 
market since 2004 and the first investment market for Taiwanese businesses in 2002. C

A
Simultaneously there has been an exponential growth in the number of  organizations, asso- S
ciations, inter-strait forums in the economic and cultural fields. This environment has E

R
O
D
U facilitated the co-optation of  Taiwanese media: most of  them are attracted by the 
C enormous Chinese market whose access is conditioned to self-censorship. The Taiwan 
T
I Affairs Office (TAO) slowly gave access to some Chinese media such as the United Daily 
O
N News (UDN) which received an authorization to print and distribute its paper in the city of  

Dongguan, and the China Times (→ p. 144). Huan Jaw-nian noted that “despite these privi-
leges, the circulation of  both Taiwanese newspapers in China has still been restricted to cer-

C tain regions, organizations, and people, such as Taiwanese enterprises, foreign businesses, 
O five-star hotels, and academic institutions for Taiwan studies.”124 Conditionality is always in 
N order: Beijing only authorized the Taiwanese television channel TTV to set up its offices 
C
E in several Chinese cities, including Beijing, after it stopped broadcasting a show on Falun 
P Gong. This request immediately propelled self-censorship because, from that moment on, 
T “most Taiwanese media planning to enter the Chinese market became reluctant to produce 
S news reports and TV programs about Falun Gong.125”

This was not a matter of  ideological convergence: even “green” media, that are pro-in-
dependence or, at least, in favor of  a strengthened national identity, play along for com-
mercial reasons. This is illustrated by the SET television channel, which was initially 
pro-DPP and anti-CCP but began to censor itself  after Ma’s election in 2008 because 

A
C the network’s president wished to expand its business in mainland China. A quan-
T titative analysis confirmed that the number of  stories on Tian’anmen, for example, has 
O continuously decreased since 2010.126 Besides, SET mainly airs Taiwanese TV shows – the 
R
S “Taiwanese drama,” a genre in its own right. But, to please Beijing, the network, which pro-

duces a majority of  them in Mandarin, renamed them “Chinese drama” in December 2011. 
This was not enough: Beijing demanded the cancellation of  the very popular but 
particularly anti-CCP show Big Talk News (大話新聞), broadcast on SET. This hap-
pened gradually: first, the show was barred from speaking about topics that irritated Beijing 
(such as the Tian’anmen massacre, the Dalai-lama or Uyghur activist Rebiya Kadeer), from 

A inviting guests seen as subversive (such as Amnesty International Taiwan’s president, a 
C
T pro-Tibet activist) or simply from criticizing China. In the end, the network cancelled Big 
I Talk News in May 2012, showing that the “China factor” could lead to self-censorship and 
O even to the elimination of  a popular TV show.127 
N
S Among pro-Chinese media, Master Chain (大師鏈) is interesting. The online media was 

created in 2018 and based in Taipei: it was the first Taiwanese media accredited by the 
Chinese government, authorized to set up an office and broadcast in mainland China. The 
firm quickly expanded, going from 15 to 50 employees and recruiting with higher salaries than 
the average in the sector thanks to a 100-million-dollar subvention from Hasdaq, a company 
registered in the United States but headquartered in Hong Kong.128 Among the new recruits, 

C were former Taiwanese military and intelligence officers, including good “catches” such 
A as the former managing director of  the National Safety Bureau Yang Kuo-chiang (楊國強)

2. Advertising 

More or less covert advertising is another tool to shape Taiwanese narratives on 
China. Since the late 2000s, the TAO and some provincial authorities in mainland China C

O
have produced advertisings (to encourage doing business, or visiting China) for Taiwanese N
media. UDN and the China Times have frequently published them, for instance, and the We C
Want group even created an agency in Beijing (Want Want China Times Cultural Media E

P
Agency) to serve as an intermediary for the Chinese government and place ads in other T
Taiwanese media.130 S

3. Money

Participating in the capital of  a company, and then taking control of  it, by buying 
up shares is the third tool: in the late 2000s, TAO “prepared a huge amount of  capital, at A
least US$300 million, with the clearly identified purpose of  purchasing stock in Taiwanese C

T
media companies such as Television Broadcasts Satellite (TVBS) channels and the UDN O
Group’s affiliated institutions.”131 United Front agents apparently pressured Chinese com- R
panies into buying Taiwanese media companies, in exchange of  a two-year tax exemption. S
The United Front then places agents in the outlets so as to take control of  their 
editorial line.132

4. Buyouts by Taiwanese tycoons
A

Finally, a fourth lever is to encourage pro-Chinese tycoons – or tycoons who have C
ties to the Chinese market – to buy Taiwanese media. This is what happened with T
Want Want. Want Want Holdings Limited is a Taiwanese food company founded in 1962 I

O
by Tsai A-shi (蔡 阿賜). In 1987, the group went to his son Tsai Eng-meng (蔡衍明), who N
massively invested in China after the martial law was lifted at the beginning of  the 1990s. S
The company created a Chinese branch in Shanghai, Want Want China Holdings, which is 
now the most important branch of  the group, and the biggest Chinese manufacturer of  
rice crackers and flavored milk – and a global leader in the market. The group makes about 
90% of  its profits in the Chinese market,133 which is where the group’s president built his 
fortune. Tsai Eng-meng, worth $6.6 billion nowadays, is the third richest man in Taiwan 
despite mainly residing in Shanghai.134 His group reportedly received at least $586.7 million C
in Chinese investment between 2004 and 2019.135 And Tsai Eng-meng returns the favor A

C “[whether] you like it or not, unification is going to happen sooner or later. I really hope I 
T
I can see that,” while denying the Tian’anmen massacre.136

O
N The group, which had initially been specialized in the food industry, decided to diversify its 

activities by investing in the media. In 2006, it bought the Taiwanese television channel 
CTV, and then the China Times Group in 2008. The China Times Group is the island’s 

C fourth biggest media conglomerate with its three dailies, including the China Times, which was 
O founded in 1950 and has the fourth largest circulation in the country, three magazines, three 
N TV channels – including CTi TV – and 8 news websites. It was subsequently renamed Want 
C
E Want China Times Group and is now led by one of  Tsai Eng-meng’s sons, Tsai Shao-chung 
P (蔡紹中, president) and by KMT vice-president and former mayor of  Taichung Jason Hu (
T 胡志強, vice-president). Want Want also created two platforms: another journal, Want Daily (
S 旺報) in 2009, and an English news website called the WantChinaTimes.com in 2010, which 

takes up so many articles from the Chinese press agency Xinhua that the website was nick-
named the “representative of  the Xinhua news agency in Taiwan.”137 

“Since then, China Times has morphed from a mainstream publication into what 
critics call a mouthpiece of  the Chinese Communist party”138 – or a so-called ‘Red’ 

A
C media, i.e., one that covers Beijing’s narratives, attacks the DPP’s government and largely 
T censors itself. Hsu noted that even if  self-censorship started before the newspaper was 
O taken over (the initially hostile China Times has gradually shifted in its attitude toward Beijing 
R
S since the mid-1990s),139 several elements showed that it has intensified since the buyup. 

First, the newspaper’s archives were purged of  any mention of  the Tian’anmen massacre.140 
The editorial line then changed: a comparison between articles published before and 
after the purchase showed its impact, with a drastic decrease in human rights-related news 
on China (two thirds fewer than before the purchase).141 Among the four biggest Taiwanese 
newspapers, comparing the ones that accept advertising from Chinese authorities (China 

A Times and UDN) and the other two (Apple Daily and Liberty Times), we see that the former 
C
T groups has “a tendency to have a more positive and detailed coverage of  information on 
I Chinese leaders and their official visits to Taiwan.” In the same vein, 100% and 77.78% of  
O articles published by the China Times and UDN on Xinjiang were based on official Chinese 
N
S sources only, and 100% and 83.33% of  them blamed the conflict solely on protesters rather 

than on the Chinese regime.142

Besides, the editorial team’s obedience to Beijing is clear, highlighted by the following 
elements. First, the CCP’s Central Propaganda department was involved in Tsai’s 
purchase of  the China Times Group, through the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), which 
is said to have intervened through a KMT leader to convince Tsai Eng-meng to buy the 

C group. At the time, the CCP feared that the group might be bought by the anti-communist 
A Next Media.143 Only two weeks after the purchase, Tsai instructed the China Times Group

managers to “strongly support the [KMT, pro-Beijing] Ma Ying-jeou administration, to D
U

improve cross-Strait relations, and to avoid discussing unification and independence in the C

Group’s media.”144 Two weeks later, Tsai met with Wang Yi, director of  the PRC’s Taiwan T
I

Affairs Office (now minister for Foreign Affairs) to “report” on the purchase and his plans O
N

for the media group.145 Besides, within less than two years, the team covering the cross-strait 
relationship was moved from the political division to the group’s headquarters in mainland 
China, for the coverage of  this sensitive topic to be directly controlled by the new executive C
team, in other words by Beijing.146 O

Quickly, the journal parted ways with the authors of  articles that had upset Beijing N
– and incidentally upset Tsai. In one instance, a journalist who was writing an article on China C

E
was also asked by his editor to first run it by the TAO.147 In March 2012, the China Times dedi- P
cated its cover to the promotion of  the Fujian governor’s visit to Taiwan. It was later revealed T
that the journal was following a document called “Propaganda plan for the Fujian gover- S
nor’s tour in Taiwan in 2012” (福建省长访台宣传计画) that the province’s authorities had 
handed out in advance and that went so far as to plan the number of  words needed for each 
article that the newspaper had to publish on the event.148 For this propaganda work, the group 
was paid through its intermediary in Beijing (Want Want China Times Cultural Media).149 But 
it ultimately cost more to the group because the coverage sparked outrage and an investi- A

C
gation from the Mainland Affairs Council (the agency in charge of  relations with mainland T
China). The journal was fined 1.8 million Taiwanese dollars (€53,200).150 It was criticized for O
disguising advertising texts paid by Beijing (advertorials, infomercials) as news and R

S
for working as an intermediary for Beijing to purchase spots in other newspapers – which is 
also illegal in Taiwan.151 In 2019, it was revealed that the editorial managers of  the China 
Times and CTi TV were getting their instructions from the TAO in Beijing: “[they] call 
every day,” said one China Times reporter. “They do not meddle in everything, mainly topics 
related to cross-Strait relations and to China. They have a say in the angle of  the story, and 
whether it goes on the front page.”152 A

The Want Want group is also involved in the dissemination of  fake news. For example, C
T

in July 2012, when hundreds of  students protested against Want Want’s project of  purchas- I
ing parts of  Next Media, which would have further increased Beijing’s hold over Taiwanese O
media, Want Want accused researcher Huand Kuo-chang of  paying the students to protest, N

S
but it admitted a month later that this claim was not supported by any proof.153 Anti-Want 
Want protests intensified (thousands of  people took to the streets on September 1), and 
the international protest campaign became international, thus prompting Tsai to give up.

Furthermore, the group also organizes meetings and cross-strait cultural forums with 
Chinese organizations, associations and think tanks suspected of  being tied to the United 
Front Work Department (UFWD) or to the PLA’s political warfare units.154

U Finally, the group’s media outlets give maximal coverage to pro-Chinese candi-
C dates during electoral campaigns. CTV and CTi TV ensured an uninterrupted coverage 
T
I of  pro-Beijing candidate Han Kuo-yu – for the Kaohsiung mayoral election (2018), for the 
O
N KMT primaries (2019), and for the presidency (2020) – contributing to the creation of  a 

“Han Wave” (→ p. 460). CTi TV was actually fined one million Taiwanese dollars (€29,500) 
by the National Communications Commission (NCC), the public authority regulating the 

C media, because it found that CTi TV had given too much airtime to Han, violating princi-
O ples of  fairness and equal speaking time.155 
N In 2017 and 2020, CTi News itself  was the subject of  30% of  all complaints to the 
C
E NCC, which decided not to renew its broadcasting license in November 2020 after 
P observing many cases of  “disinformation” and traces of  “external interference.” 
T The NCC had never taken such a decision since its creation in 2006.156 The Taiwan 
S Supreme Administrative Court rejected the network’s appeal and CTi News ceased to 

broadcast on Taiwanese cable television (Channel 52) on December 11, 2020. It remains 
available online however.

Want Want’s example has been emulated: knowing how beneficial China Times’ pur-
chase was to Tsai, because Beijing granted him favors. Other Taiwanese tycoons have 

A
C become involved in the media, with the sole goal of  pleasing Beijing and using that 
T relationship to make profits for their companies in other sectors. Taiwanese smart-
O phone-maker HTC thus took control of  the TVBS Media group, which runs four national 
R
S and one international TV channels. It did so by buying a high number of  shares in 2011 and 

then by becoming majority shareholder in 2015. Furthermore, the Taiwanese group Ting 
Hsin, specialized in food production (biggest producer of  instant noodles in China) also 
bought one of  the biggest companies of  cable TV, China Network System (CNS), in 2014. 
At the time, CNS ran eleven channels.157

S appointments to key positions (a CTi TV journalist explained that the way a number of  

Taiwanese media cover China was “organized” by representatives of  the Chinese state who 
appointed China-based correspondents to editorial positions);159 and the organization of  
bilateral forums such as the Cross-Strait Media People Summit (兩岸媒體人峰會/兩

1. Political parties A
C

The KMT has become less important to Beijing since it lost power: “more and more T
O

you will hear voices in the CCP who also claim that the KMT is no longer the counterpart R
that they were banking on for unification with Taiwan.”164 For that reason, Beijing tries S
to diversify its channels of  influence. In this instance, three small pro-unification 
political parties are used as local intermediaries by Beijing: 

• The New Party (NP – 新黨), created in 1993. Its spokesperson Wang Ping-chung 
(王炳忠), his father, and two executives of  the Party’s Youth were found guilty of  
espionage on behalf  of  China in June 2018 due to their implication in an operation A
led by the Chinese citizen Zhou Hongxu (周泓旭) – also charged with espionage in C
September 2017. The small group, which called itself  the “secret Star Fire unit,” cre- T

I
ated a website (Fire News) to recruit Taiwanese people, including civil servants. They O
tried to obtain classified documents through members of  the Taiwanese military, N
mostly on armament programs. Investigations discovered evidence of  money transfers S

from mainland China and a document on which Wang Ping-chung wrote “I work under 
the guidance and assistance of  the CCP to help the forces working to achieve unification 
across the Taiwan Strait.”165 This indictment clearly did not deter the NP from building 
a closer relationship with Beijing, as the party announced its intention to open a liaison 
office in mainland China right after the conviction.166 

C
• The Chinese Unification Promotion Party (CUPP – 中華統一促進黨) created A
in 2005. It was created by Chang An-le (張安樂), a man with a sultry reputation who S

U became famous for his ties to organized crime. Known as the “White Wolf,”167 he was 
C a leader of  the Bamboo Connection (竹聯幫) gang, one of  the largest Taiwanese triads, 
T
I which also operates in the United States. Chang An-le was arrested there in 1985 under 
O
N several charges including murder and drug trafficking. After serving a ten-year sentence 

in a U.S. prison, he came back to Taiwan where he quickly became involved in a case 
of  corruption, which led him to flee to mainland China where he stayed for ten years. 

C According to J. Michael Cole, that was when Chang An-le spent time with several “Red 
O princes” including Hu Shiying (胡石英), who is said to be part of  Xi Jinping’s “close 
N circle.”168 He then founded the CUUP from China, and its Taiwanese branch in 2005. 
C
E He came back in Taiwan in 2013 and was briefly arrested. He was arrested again in 
P August 2019, charged with several offences including having received tens of  thousands 
T of  dollars from China, which is illegal in Taiwan under the Political Donations Act.169 
S Some suspect that the CUPP, like other pro-Beijing political groups, receives 

money from Beijing through Chinese companies, including those tied to the Taolue 
group (韜略集團) but also from criminal organizations (the Bamboo Connection and 
the Four Seas (四海幫)),170 networks of  Buddhist temples and various United Front 
organizations in the area and in the world.171 The CUPP also created several cross-strait 

A
C groups such as the Tainan Cross-Strait Exchange Promotion Association (台南市兩岸
T 交流協 會) and the Cross-Strait Taiwan Guangdong Exchange Association (台粵交流
O 協會會), whose final goal is to circumvent the Taiwanese government.172 The CUPP 
R
S is presumably also used as an intermediary for Taiwanese companies that wish to settle 

in China and ensure that “ideological conditions” will be met by incoming companies.173 
• The Home Party (HP – 紅黨)174 created in 2017, which aims, among other things, 
to “uniting the majority of  Taiwanese farmers and fishermen” (統合廣大農漁工)175 
– key populations in the Taiwanese political landscape (and historically swayed by the 

A KMT), who are regularly targeted by disinformation campaigns that, for example, dis-
C credit the agricultural policies of  the DPP (→ p. 465). The HP was involved in at least 
T two cases that showed its role in Chinese influence operations on the island. The first

N the Communist Party School of  the Fujian Province (中共党校福建省委党校台湾社

its teachers come from Beijing-based think tanks affiliated with the CCP. Student were 
expected to identify as Chinese and to support the One China policy. The second case 
occurred in April 2019, when the HP co-organized an event in Taichung called “2019

C
2. Individuals O

N
In addition to investing in political parties, Beijing also invests in individuals – C

E
politicians noticed for their potential or existing pro-Chinese inclinations and for P
their more-or-less strategic positions in the Taiwanese political landscape. Members T
of  parliament, mayors, and advisors of  various political backgrounds are invited on all- S

expense-paid, usually luxurious trips to mainland China where they meet CCP execu-
tives for instance. They are then expected to implement policies in favor of  Beijing at their 
respective levels. 

Granting access to a special economic zone is one of  the methods used to cap-
ture the political elite and/or their family members, thus offering preferential con- A

C
ditions to foreign companies. Cole reported that Beijing used this technique to “capture” T
Lin Kuo-ching (林 國慶), a former DPP politician who became independent and stood O
out in October 2019 when he said that “no one likes Taiwan more than Xi Jinping.” This R

S
declaration was surprising but probably explained by the fact that his son Lin Chih-yuan (
林智遠) owns a company operating in the Pingtan free-trade zone. He is also the assistant 
general manager of  the Pingtan Free Trade Zone Cross-Strait Development Co. (平潭自
貿區兩岸發展公司) and has been active within the Chinese People’s Political Consultative 
Conference.178

D. Influencers and other intermediaries T

O

1. Groups and prominent figures on the cultural and artistic scenes N
S

Beijing has, at the very least, two different tools in this area. First, using Chinese artists 
or cultural events as relays: Chinese artists that tour Taiwan can be used as vectors 
of  “political warfare,” through the propaganda that they can spread or the contacts 
they can make. J. Michael Cole explained that the events themselves are usually not prob-
lematic, but they are used as a cover or opportunity to carry out other operations: “when 
they organize Chinese singing competitions, or concerts at National Taiwan University, it’s C
not the songs that they’re singing that are a threat to Taiwanese society, it’s the individuals A

S
who are organizing the event […] coming to Taiwan and using their time off  to interact E
with other individuals and hopefully recruit some Taiwanese, or co-opt them.”179

Taipei is aware of  that risk and has already barred some individuals from visiting – such 
as Liu Qi (刘奇), who introduced himself  as the leader of  an art group planning to per-

U form in Taiwan in November 2019. Liu was also the director of  the Cultural Department 
C of  a United Front organization, the All-China Federation of  Returned Overseas Chinese 
T
I (ACFROC, 中华全国归国华侨联合会).180 Cole also mentionned the Shanghai-Taipei 
O
N “Sing! China” music festival, which was planned at National Taiwan University (NTU) in 

September 2017 and co-organized by the city of  Taipei and several cultural organizations 
in Shanghai. The event was actually devised to promote “the peaceful unification of  the 

C motherland,” as one Shanghai organization described on its website.181 The Chinese coun-
O terpart even made a request, which was eventually granted: they wanted the “National 
N Taiwan University” renamed as “Taipei City Taiwan University” in promotional material.182 
C
E The event was eventually cancelled following student protests, but similar events had taken 
P place on other campuses in the preceding weeks and years. 
T Second, Beijing can also use the Chinese market as a lever to control Taiwanese 
S artists. There, as often, both the carrot and the stick are used. The carrot: Beijing identi-

fies Taiwanese celebrities on TV, invites them to China and explains that, over there, their 
salary can be between 5 and 10 times higher. The stick: members of  the Taiwanese cul-
tural industry identified as hostile to the CCP are denounced and often targeted by 
naming and shaming campaigns on social networks, which push them to apologize and 

A
C publicly recognize that they identify as Chinese, or else they risk seeing their contracts, tours 
T and shows cancelled. Access to the huge Chinese market being important, even vital, for 
O much of  the cultural industry, Beijing thus succeeds in whipping them back in line, and in 
R
S some cases in turning Taiwanese actors, singers and models into real ambassadors 

for the CCP.183 

2. Civic organizations

Besides, Beijing uses “civic organizations” such as the Concentric Patriotism Association 
A (中華愛國同心會) – which, along with its secretary general Chang Hsiu-yeh (張秀葉), 
C
T openly advocates for reunification184 – that defend the CCP’s interests down to the 
I streets of  Taiwan, sometimes violently attacking targets such as Falun Gong members 
O and pro-democracy and pro-independence activists.185 These organizations are also used to 
N mobilize people for protests, even paying them (between 800 and 900 Taiwanese dollars 
S (€23-26) per person to wave a PRC flag during various events in Taipei, according to 

J. Michael Cole).186

3. Networks of  Buddhist and Taoist temples 

Some temples are suspected of  contributing to the United Front’s activities. An article 
C
A published in Mirror Media on October 2, 2019 revealed that yearly pilgrimages, including 
S one dedicated to the goddess Mazu, are reportedly used as a cover for agents to orga-
E nize meetings, transfer Chinese funds for United Front activities and to pressure

uncooperative temples.187 About thirty temples, mostly in the south of  the island, are pre- D
U

sumably involved. The article explained that these temples had been infiltrated by members C

of  the Chinese Unification Promotion Party, led by Chang An-le. However, according to T
I

a study by Luo Cheng-tsung,188 a professor at the Southern Taiwan University for Science O
N

and Technology, the 30 mentioned temples are only minor temples with little influence. 
According to him, attention should be paid to the main temples on the island, which are 
also under the influence of  the CCP. C

In June-July 2017, a campaign accused President Tsai and her government of  “persecut- O
ing religion” and rapidly grew in intensity. The rumor specifically targeted the network of  N
Buddhist and Taoist temples, with false announcements, such as a fake news announcing C

E
that the government would prohibit incense.189

4. The business community S

The Taishang (臺商) – businesspersons working in mainland China – are import-
ant intermediaries for Beijing, not solely because of  their sheer number, but also because 
of  their economic and political weight. Some of  them, members of  local CCP branches or 
of  United Front organizations, participate in Chinese influence operations. A

C
T

5. Members of  the military O
R

Senior officers and retired generals, especially freshly-retired generals, are a prime S
target for Beijing, because they are knowledgeable on Taiwanese defense capacities and the 
organization of  its armed forces, and because they have a high-level network of  still-active 
promotion comrades who have reached the highest levels of  the hierarchy. These young 
retirees are thus invited to China to participate in ceremonies, where they embody the One 
China policy (in November 2016, the presence of  32 former Taiwanese officers singing the A
Chinese anthem at a memorial ceremony in China stirred a controversy), or to various events, C
during which sports or culture are useful opportunities to organize meetings. T

I
Between the summers of  2009 and 2011, at least twelve such events took place in China. O

For example, from June 1 to June 6, 2011, Chinese and Taiwanese retired military officers N
attended a golf  tournament in Sichuan, visited the area hit by the 2008 Wenchuan earth- S
quake and held a seminar on cross-strait relations in Beijing.190 Other meetings do not 
even pretend to be cultural or sports events and get straight to the point: in April 
2010, retired general Hsu Li-Nung (許歷農), the former director of  the department 
of  political warfare of  the Taiwanese army led a delegation of  twenty former offi-
cers through a trip in Beijing and Shanghai where they met, among others, “State 
Council Taiwan Affairs Office Director Wang Yi, Politburo Standing Committee Member C

U rarely, these meetings take place in Taiwan (in May 2010, about fifty former officers

O

C These ties between both straits are often maintained by the Whampoa Military Academy 
O Alumni Association (黄埔军校) – founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1924; the military academy 
N has trained generals from both the nationalist and the communist sides of  the Strait.194 Yet, 
C
E this alumni association is actually a United Front organization operated by the UFWD. 
P Hence, meetings between Chinese and Taiwanese officers are anything but spontaneous: 
T they are simply one of  the United Front’s many programs.
S Beijing uses these meetings to create a network and solidify its influence, even 

inside the Taiwanese armed forces and intelligence services. It also sometimes 
uses them to destabilize the Taiwanese public opinion. It was thus revealed that, at a 
mundane event in Beijing, Hsia Ying-chou (夏瀛洲), a retired general from the Taiwanese 
armed forces, and former NDU President, reportedly said that “[from] now on, we should 

A
C no longer separate the ROC Army (ROC meaning Taiwan) and the PLA. We are all China’s 
T army.”195 Hsia Ying-chou denied saying this. Regardless, Beijing achieved its goal by con-
O vincing Taiwan, where a controversy erupted, that such outbursts were at least possible.

conduct for retired generals visiting China.196

6. YouTubers

Everywhere in the world, YouTubers have become a main channel for information C
O

for young audiences. Cognizant of  this, Beijing tries to control their impact on N
Chinese public opinion, and to use them to attack Taiwan. During the last presidential C
campaign, for instance, after YouTuber Potter King (波特王) filmed a show with President E

P
Tsai, his Chinese partner Papitube asked him to delete it, criticizing him for calling Tsai T
“President” (a forbidden label in China, which uses “Taiwan leader” to avoid implying that S
Taiwan is a sovereign state). Potter King refused, thus ending the contract that allowed him 
to broadcast in China. Papitube said it “strongly rebukes any action which undermines the 
nation’s (China) dignity.”197 After the incident, the YouTuber was also unable to access his 
Weibo account, where he had a million fans.198 

Beijing also tries to recruit Taiwanese people to influence the Taiwanese pub- A
lic opinion while covering its tracks, especially after the scandal around the Chinese C

T
YouTuber posing as a Taiwanese person (→ p. 467). They are reportedly trained by O
the PLA (both in terms of  their technical skills and in terms of  the content they will pro- R
duce).199 S

7. Disgruntled individuals

Generally, Beijing targets those in Taiwan who can become spokespersons because they 
have influence, but it also looks for those who are motived because they are unhappy with A
the current political order. For instance, and not unlike Canada or Australia, Aboriginals, C
or “First Nations,” are prime targets as they are regularly neglected by authorities. In Taiwan, T

I
Beijing targets aboriginal media and young people aspiring to a better life, but also O
disappointed shop owners in distressed areas, such as in the touristic sectors areas. To N
counter Beijing’s strategy of  controlling the number of  tourists to pressure the island, the S
government’s diversification strategy has been a success in recent years. It compensates 
the loss of  Chinese tourists with a higher number of  tourists from Japan and from Gulf  
countries especially, who also have a greater purchasing power. Tourism was doing well 
before being impacted by the pandemic, in ways similar to tourism all around the world. 
Nevertheless, because Chinese tourists visited specific areas not always toured by new tour-
ists, some tour-operators, gift shops, restaurants and other local shops in these areas were C

A
upset by the development. Hence, they are prime targets for Chinese influence operations S
attacking the Taiwanese government. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that most E
of  these areas are in the south, where local authorities are more sympathetic to China to 
begin with.

S of  Chinese people who become Taiwanese citizens are women. This can be explained by 

the relative low competitiveness of  middle-class Taiwanese men on the Taiwanese marriage 
market, which means that these men sometimes go to China or Vietnam to find spouses. 
Hence, women can become relays, but they must be accounted for individually, as they do 
not form an organized group and they cannot trigger mass movements of  their own.

O III. Information manipulation
R
S

In its outward appearances, the Chinese strategy of  information manipulation in Taiwan 
roughly follows the same pattern: fake or biased information “first appearing in Chinese 
state- or party-controlled media is then spread via Chinese social media. The disinformation 
is subsequently injected into the Taiwan media environment via social media – PTT board 
(a Taiwanese bulletin board system), Facebook fan pages, and closed groups – and is finally 

A
C picked up and legitimized by traditional media.”201 Facebook is the most widely used 
T social network (nearly 79.6% of  Taiwanese people, a world record which explains why 
I Facebook “has been a very important playground for disinformation in Taiwan”202). 
O Facebook is ahead of  YouTube (72.6%) and LINE, which is the most prominently used 
N
S instant messaging application (98.5%), way ahead of  Facebook Messenger (48.2%).203 

2,400 disinformation attacks are carried out daily on Facebook solely, “all of  them 
originating from China,” and aiming to undermine Taiwanese democracy and its 
institutions.204 They are all meticulously planned, with spikes of  disinformation occurring 
between 7 and 9 a.m., when Taiwanese people are in public transports using their phones.

During a parliamentary hearing in May 2019, lieutenant general Vincent Chen (陳文凡), 
C deputy director of  the National Security Bureau, confirmed that a few Taiwanese media 
A had adopted Beijing’s editorial line (he described them as “complying media” (同路媒體)), 
S and operated on a number of  platforms (print or online press, social media) to spread dis-
E information in Taiwan. The NSB said these operations were part of  cognitive warfare (认

知 作战) in that they aim to shape a narrative that fits with Beijing’s interests.205 Chen did

not reveal the names of  these media, a decision that was criticized, including by KMT rep- D

resentative Lu Yui-ling (呂玉玲), but it could be interpreted as a warning shot sent to these C

media companies.206 He however insisted on problems stemming from the purchase T
I

of  Facebook fan pages and social influencers by Beijing and confirmed that some O
N

Taiwanese media were asking Beijing for approval before publishing opinion pieces.207 
The credibility of  people spreading disinformation is at stake. How to earn the trust 

of  the targets? One of  the main methods is to pretend to be a direct witness, some- C
one speaking from experience (at Kansai airport, for example, in the case of  typhoon O
Jebi → p. 456). Another method is to institutionalize fake information, by making it N
seem like it comes from government officials, sometimes counterfeiting documents C

E
to legitimate the information.208 By the time the information is verified, and the govern- P
ment issues a denial, the damage has already been done. T

In terms of  substance, these stories mainly revolve around four topics. First, the S
(DPP) government is painted as unable to work efficiently, not providing for the needs 
of  its population, its protection… Some ad hominem attacks also target the president and 
members of  the ruling majority. Second, they discuss Taiwan’s relationship to China 
(its independence), which is the key question defining the Taiwanese identity. Here, we 
obtained contradictory information from our interviews: for some, Chinese operations nur- A

C
ture both sides of  the debate, pro-unification and pro-independence alike, because they aim T
to divide the society rather than to impose a narrative, mirroring what the Russians did in O
the United States and in Europe (→ p. 620).209 For others, Beijing differs from Moscow as R

S
it only supports unification and always discredits independence and the DPP. Third, they 
focus on divisive societal topics that include agriculture (spreading rumors on falling 
prices), labor (a government allegedly pushing people to work more and earn less), LGBT 
rights and gay marriage (society is divided along generational lines here, with young people 
being more favorable, older and more religious people opposed to it), nuclear power, eco-
nomic problems (particularly low wages; unemployment is not an issue in itself), pensions, A
etc. Immigration is among other controversial topics that could be used in the future, but C

T
it has been relatively left aside for now. Fourth, the stories emphasize diplomatic rela- I
tions and Taiwan’s uncertain position on the international stage (→ p. 476). O

Of  course, the narratives are adapted to different targets: the government’s economic N
S

failure and the lack of  a future in Taiwan for young people (Taiwan is presented as a 
ghost island, see box below); the agricultural crisis, insecurity, health issues… to old people 
(harder to reach because they are less connected).

T The ghost island narrative
I
O One of  the most common narratives used by Beijing to weaken and divide the Taiwanese 
N society is the ghost island narrative (鬼岛): Taiwan is portrayed as having nothing to offer 

to its youth (low salaries, no professional opportunities).210 Beijing nourishes that story, not 
only by spreading messages on social media (there is even a namesake Facebook group,211 and 

C forums on which young Chinese people discuss the topic). They also organize a brain drain: 
O the China’s State Council Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) disclosed in early March 2018 “31 
N incentives” (对台31项措 施) to attract companies and Taiwanese individuals to come live in 
C mainland China, by pushing for the distribution of  Taiwanese cultural products (movies, tele-
E vision programs, books) in China, for example, or by having authors receive training in China 
P or become members of  Chinese professional organizations.212 In November 2019, 26 new 
T measures were added to the list, 13 for companies and 13 for individuals.
S

There has been an increased awareness of  Taiwan’s vulnerability to misinformation since 
two distinct events in 2018: the aftermath of  typhoon Jebi in Japan and, two months later, 
the November 2018 municipal elections. 

A
C
T A. The Typhoon Jebi Affair: when disinformation kills
O
R
S This is a rare example of  information manipulation that indirectly 

led to someone’s death; the incident “was a turning point in the 
understanding of  information manipulation in Taiwan and 
their capacity to inflict damages.”213 

Category 5 typhoon Jebi was the most violent typhoon to 
hit Japan since 1993. It hit the Kansai region on September 4, 

A 2018. Consequently, Kansai International Airport, not far from 
C
T Osaka, was severely flooded, grounding more than 3,000 per-
I sons, including 750 Chinese and 500 Taiwanese citizens. On 
O day later, at 12:23pm, a Weibo account named “Baby flooding 
N
S beast” (洪水猛兽baby) posted a message stating that the Chinese embassy was “send-

ing chartered buses to evacuate Chinese travelers” and ending with “I spontaneously 
feel pride and cannot help to have tears in my eyes. China, I love you!” while tagging the 
Xinhua press agency, the People’s Daily (人民日报) and the Communist Youth League 
to attract their attention. Three hours later, the Chinese website Guancha (观察者 网) 
published an article untitled “750 Chinese citizens blocked at a Japanese airport, the 

C powerful motherland comes to rescue them” which stated that the general consulate in 
A Osaka had sent 15 buses to evacuate Chinese travelers. The article cited the aforemen-
S tioned message from “Baby flooding beast” as well as Weibo account users claiming to 
E have been among the Chinese people evacuated from the airport. According to those 

messages, Taiwanese people who wanted to get on the bus were told that they could

benefit from this service from the “motherland” if  they felt Chinese (觉得自己是中 D
U

国人就能上车).214 Official Chinese media picked up the story.215 C

The story reached Taiwanese social media the following morning, first via Professional T
I

Technology Temple (PTT), the most popular online forum in Taiwan. An account O
N

named “czqs2000” posted a message titled “Does anyone have information on Chinese 
passengers getting preferential access to buses in Kansai international airport?” Other 
users shared articles from Guancha and the Global Times. Following this, the daily tab- C
loid Taiwan Apple Daily (蘋果日報) published a message initially titled “The Chinese O
embassy sent buses to pick up Chinese passengers at the Kansai airport and asked N
Taiwanese people to declare themselves as Chinese to get on the bus.”216 Two hours C

E
later, a PTT account user under the name “GuRuGuRu” claimed to be a Taiwanese P
traveler stuck at the airport the previous day, and said she was able to get on a bus T
sent by China without having to identify as Chinese. She added that she had contacted S

the Taiwan Representative Office in Osaka but did not receive any help. Her message 
was extensively shared and discussed on Taiwanese social media. On September 14, 
Su Chii-cherng, (蘇啟誠), a Taiwanese diplomat and managing director of  the 
Osaka branch of  Taipei’s Economic and Cultural Bureau committed suicide, hanging 
himself  at his home in Japan. He left a letter in which he said he could not bear the A

C
humiliation and public criticism that accused his bureau of  not doing enough for T
his fellow citizens blocked at the airport. O

The following day, TFC published an investigation showing that all these stories were R
S

based on a false premise: in reality, and as was confirmed by a spokesperson of  the Kansai 
airport, the Chinese consulate never sent buses to pick up Chinese citizens.217 The 
buses were chartered by Japanese authorities for all passengers, without distinction. The 
Chinese consulate had indeed asked to send its own buses, but its request was rejected by 
the Japanese authorities.218 Airport authorities moved the passengers to a transit terminal 
in a mall in the city of  Izumisano, 11.6 km away from the airport. And it is there that the A

C
Chinese consulate sent its buses, which picked up Chinese citizens, but no Taiwanese citi- T
zen (not the 1044 “Chinese” people, including 32 Taiwanese, claimed by the Chinese con- I
sulate).219 During the airport’s evacuation, staff  members from the China Southern Airline O
company gathered Chinese citizens in one of  the buses, but it had not been sent by the N

S
consulate. 

Hence, a controversy was allowed to grow for a dozen days, leading to one death, 
as none of  the Taiwanese media involved in the scandal bothered to check the 
initial information: they simply took anonymous online testimonies for granted, with-
out being suspicious. Political figures such as KMT’s Arthur Chen (陳宜民) were also 
instrumental in spreading the Chinese narrative. On September 17, the Taiwanese media C
watchdog (National Communications Commission, NCC) intervened and sent a warning A
to several televisions channels and online media who had not verified information in this S
story. In reality, the case showed that “the Taiwanese society in 2018 was generally E

U not aware of  the [risk posed by] disinformation operations.”220 This incident made 
C the population and social platforms more aware of  disinformation as both serious 
T
I and potentially lethal. It was evident for PTT, which stopped registering new accounts 
O
N for some time afterward. 

In December 2019, Taiwanese influencer Slow Yang (楊蕙如), who built her wealth 
in the credit card business, and Tsai Fu-ming (蔡福明), were charged for having orga-

C nized online harassment against Su Chii-cherng by paying several Internet users to 
O insult him.221

N While Taiwanese media bear a huge responsibility in this story, its origin remains 
C
E suspicious. A rather common incident was transformed into an issue tied to the Taiwanese 
P identity by an article from Guancha, which spread the (false) news that Taiwanese people had 
T to identify as Chinese to get on buses reportedly chartered by the Chinese authorities. But 
S Guancha “operates under Beijing’s Central Network Security and Information Committee 

Office.”222 The “czqs2000” account then spread the rumor on Taiwanese networks by post-
ing it on PTT. This is not irrefutable evidence, but its IP address (221.219.231.115) is based 
in Beijing and is apparently owned by a Chinese press photographer.223 Moreover, there 
was a “grouped publication” phenomenon on Facebook, found in many other disinfor-

A
C mation cases, including during electoral campaigns, which consists in groups of  fan pages 
T publishing at about the same time or within very similar time frames.224 This highlights a 
O possibly coordinated campaign, further signaling its potential state origin. To sum up, this 
R
S fake story, designed to become viral in Taiwan, was presumably fabricated in China, 

spread by Chinese relays, introduced in Taiwan by a Chinese Internet user and then 
circulated on Taiwanese social networks, including on Facebook, in a coordinated 
fashion. For all these reasons, this could be a Chinese disinformation operation in 
which Taiwanese media, because of  their incompetence, were objectively Chinese 
allies.

C
T B. Electoral interference
I
O
N Not only does Beijing continue to rely on the permanent networks described in this 
S chapter, it also intensifies its efforts during key moments of  the Taiwanese democratic 

life, particularly during electoral campaigns. Electoral interference mainly takes two shapes. 
First, covert financial support for selected candidates: “[such] funds are believed to be 
made available through Hong Kong, through ‘dual use’ Chinese companies, via Taiwanese 
companies with a presence in China, and in the form of  hard cash brought by couriers (e.g., 
businesspeople on visits across the Taiwan Strait).”225 Second, it is evident in the numerous 

C information manipulations.

1. The November 2018 municipal elections D
U
C

There was a peak in information manipulations during the municipal elections orga- T
I

nized on November 24, 2018, and which were largely won by the KMT. It was highlighted O

by a study of  more than 5,000 messages reported to the Cofacts platform as being poten- N

tially false during the four months preceding the elections, and one month after.226 Taiwan 
has always been the target of  influence and disinformation operations emanating from 
mainland China, but they were particularly intense in this instance: “Taiwan’s 2018 election C

O
was the first time for this island to be massively attacked by fake news or disinforma- N
tion.”227 C

There are probably a few reasons explaining this intensity: President Tsai’s election two E
P

years earlier put an end to the KMT’s political dominance and redefined Taiwan’s relation T
to China. This election, which was largely perceived as a referendum on the president, S
questioned the national identity. Finally, the President was unpopular (her approval rate 
had fallen from 70% to 30%), mostly because of  reforms on divisive issues – gay marriage, 
labor rights, pensions, etc. – some of  which were at the center of  a multiple-choice referen-
dum on the day of  the election. These controversial topics were logically instrumentalized 
during the electoral campaign. Minister Lo Ping-chen (羅秉成), who was in charge of  the A
fight against disinformation, said that “on the gay marriage issue – this policy was distorted C

T
to such an extent that [it claimed] there will be no more moms and dads after such a refer- O
endum was passed.”228 R

Two months before the election, the Ministry of  Justice’s Investigation Bureau (法務 S

部調查 局) released a communiqué claiming to have “unequivocal evidence” of  the 
Chinese government’s interference in the campaign through content farms pro-
ducing divisive fake news to divide the Taiwanese society.229 It also investigated 33 
cases of  suspected Chinese financial contributions to Taiwanese candidates.230 The 
National Security Bureau (NSB) speaks of  “media and psychological warfare” against the A
island, which it compared to the Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. It detected C
“many content farms, many bots and purchases of  ‘likes’ coming from China and support- T

I
ing pro-Chinese candidates only, through private companies.”231 “It costs 5,000 Taiwanese O
dollars to buy 1,000 logins, and the price rises during election campaigns. Some accounts N
change their IP addresses every day,” a member of  government explained, adding that “the S

most common modus operandi was the spreading of  fake news on social media, on Facebook 
and on LINE, before they got picked up by conventional media. We also saw usurpated IP 
addresses, fake accounts, and attempts to provoke or accentuate divisions between people 
who were pro and anti-China.”232 It also seems that illegal bets played a role too: “the like-
lihood of  high returns if  a certain candidate is elected could encourage bettors to call upon 
their friends and families to vote for the candidate in question.”233 C

U Many irregularities were found in the campaign for the country’s second biggest 
C city, Kaohsiung (2.8 million inhabitants). For two decades, the city was controlled by the 
T
I DPP, which won the previous elections with 68% of  the votes. The incumbent mayor, 
O
N Chen Chu (陳菊) held the record of  political longevity in the country after 1945 (2006-

2018). This time, she was facing a KMT candidate, pro-Beijing Han Kuo-yu, whose popu-
list style, such as the slogan “Make Kaohsiung Rich and Great” won him the nickname of  

C the Taiwanese Trump, save for the fact that, unlike Trump he had largely been unknown 
O months before the vote. His meteoric rise, which led him to be elected mayor, may 
N have been greatly helped by Beijing. At first, there were a few suspicious signs. His 
C
E social media accounts had a level of  “community engagements” (an aggregate of  likes, 
P comments, and shares across the Internet) many times higher than all of  the other KMT 
T candidates combined.234 His Facebook account in particular prompted suspicions. His 
S official page’s popularity growth was spectacular, it gained 225,882 “likes” and 235,038 

followers in less than a month, three times more than his DPP opponent and higher than 
the national average (around 12,000 “likes” and followers).235 The page had about half  a 
million followers at the end of  the campaign – twice as many as his DPP opponent, Chen, 
whose page was filled with insults and hateful comments. 

A
C A Facebook group supporting him named “Han Kuo-yu Fans for Victory! Holding 
T up a Blue Sky!” (韓國瑜粉絲後援團 必勝! 撐起一片藍天), created just one day after 
O Han declared his candidacy, played an important role in the campaign. With around 
R
S 61,000 members at the time of  the election, it became a hub offering many resources 

(talking points, memes, fake news discrediting the DPP opponent, etc.) to Han supporters. 
Yet, it was later established that this group had not been created by actual fans of  the 
candidates, but rather “created, managed, and nurtured by what looks very much 
like a professional cybergroup from China.”236 Three of  its admins, involved from 
the beginning, were suspicious accounts which turned completely inactive a day after 

A the election. The LinkedIn profiles linked to these accounts exhibited stereotypical patterns 
C
T and displayed the exact same characteristics as 249 other accounts: same description 
I in simplified Chinese characters, similar mugshot-style photos that could have been cropped 
O from decades-old graduation pictures, all claiming to be Tencent employees and Peking 
N
S University graduates.237 Some even used the same photo under different names, thus 

confirming the fraud. Paul Huang, who uncovered the operation, added that “LinkedIn 
is known to be one of  Beijing’s favorite playgrounds for conducting espionage and 
influence operations.”238 Numerous cases revealed in the United States,239 in Germany,240 
or in France,241 showed Beijing to be capable and used to creating hundreds or thou-
sands of  accounts to scout, approach – and potentially recruit – targets, which is eas-

C ier on LinkedIn, where people are usually looking for professional opportunities. Besides, 
A LinkedIn is the only major American social media allowed in China.242

Another element pointing to Chinese interference came after the fact, with the defection D
U

of  Wang Liqiang (王立强), who claims he had been an intelligence officer and asked C

Australia for political asylum in November 2019. His confession should be taken with T
I

a pinch of  salt, but he claimed to have participated in influence operations against O
N

Taiwan during the 2018 elections by creating 200,000 fake accounts on social media 
and offering no less than 1.5 billion yuan (€188.5 million) to Taiwanese media to 
promote Han Kuo-yu’s campaign against President Tsai.243 Based on the data released by C
Wang, two people he named were arrested in Taiwan for being Chinese agents. O

Finally, regarding the extent to which fake news spread during this campaign actually N
reached their goals – whether or not they really influenced the electors’ opinions – a survey C

E
carried out immediately after the vote, on a sample of  1,068 voters, highlighted the two P
most influential fake news: that President Tsai did not leave her armored vehicle and “hid” T
behind armed soldiers as she visited a region that had suffered from heavy floods in 2018; S
and the typhoon Jebi affair (→ p. 456). The study also showed that the voters who were 
the most influenced were politically independent. That year, a majority of  them voted for 
the KMT.244 

Largely perceived as a referendum on the government and as a general repetition for the 
January 2020 general elections, the 2018 municipal elections were also an eye opener, A

C
and increased awareness of  the risks posed by electoral interference. They also high- T
lighted the leading role played by content farms (→ p. 367) since it is now accepted that, O
during the 2018 campaign, a large part of  the published content was produced in con- R

S
tent farms coordinated by the PLA.245

2. The presidential and legislative elections of  January 2020

On January 11, 2020 Taiwan organized its 15th presidential election and 10th legislative 
election. Democratic Progressive Party Incumbent Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected with 57.1% A
of  the votes, against the Kuomintang candidate Han Kuo-Yu (38.61%) and the People C

T
First Party candidate James Soong (4.26%). Turnout stood at 75% (compared to 66% in I
2016) – the highest in twenty years. According to Liberty Times Net, the number of  voters O
that registered abroad doubled compared to 2016.246 The DPP also maintained its majority N
in the Legislative Yuan, while losing a few seats (from 68 to 61). The KMT gained three S

seats (now 38). The Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), led by the mayor of  Taipei, won 5 seats 
but only 1.5 million votes, compared to 4.8 million and 4.7 million for the DPP and KMT 
respectively. The remaining 9 seats went to other parties. This election also contributed 
to feminizing the parliament: women won 45.6% of  the seats, which is comparable to 
Scandinavian countries.

During this election, and not unlike the preceding one, “we observed Chinese C
A

state-affiliated activities stealthily targeting every segment of  the influence oper- S
ations lifecycle, from production and amplification to dissemination.”247 Beijing E
started by covertly funding some candidates. In December 2019, the Justice Ministry

O
N Authorities also found and closed 1,700 clandestine casinos, seized more than 50 million

Information manipulation was however less prominent than expected, for several 
C reasons. First, precisely because the government and civil society were better pre-
O pared following the 2018 fiasco.250 Second, because Chinese efforts had been concen-
N trated on the Hong Kong crisis, particularly between September and November 2019, 
C
E leading to more sloppy and less subtle operations against Taiwan that were easier to spot 
P for these reasons. These operations were also carried out in vain, since the Hong Kong 
T crisis was a strong repellant: it confirmed Beijing’s anti-democratic ambitions and the 
S failure of  a “One Country, Two Systems” policy. This clearly made things more difficult 

for pro-unification candidates, particularly for Han Kuo-yu (KMT), the incumbent pres-
ident’s main opponent. It became quite clear during the summer, or at the beginning of  
the fall of  2019, that he would not win the presidency. From that moment on, there was 
no point for Beijing in investing too much in an unwinnable election. What could be 

A
C impacted, though, were the legislative elections, which was taking place simultaneously, with 
T the objective of  making as many pro-unification candidates win as possible. Finally, digital 
O platforms were proactive. Facebook, especially, recruited a staff  to specifically oversee 
R
S the electoral campaign, set up an “election war room,” deleted 51 accounts, 118 pages as 

well as 99 groups linked to them for “unauthentic behavior.” Suppressions of  this kind are 
actually frequent but they were noticed this time around, because one of  the groups, sup-
porting Han Kuo-yu’s candidacy, had more than 150,000 followers. Facebook had to justify 
itself. Apparently, the manipulations were not coordinated, and their origin was not estab-
lished. From Facebook’s point of  view, elements hinting to China (such as the use of  

A simplified characters or the time when people were active) were not necessarily prob-
C
T lematic, Chinese web-users having the right to express support for a Taiwanese candidate. 
I We should also note that the page belonging to the third candidate, James Soong (founder 
O and president of  the pro-unification and anti-independence People’s First Party) gained 
N
S 500,000 “likes” (+359%) and almost 500,000 followers (+356%) between the December 

12 and 16, 2019, compared to only about 12,000 (both likes and followers) in the following 
weeks – a gain “unlikely to be organic,”251 that points at the use of  bots and fake accounts 
to artificially inflate a community. 

According to the Taiwan FactCheck Center, the first fact-checking organization in 
Taiwan, the disinformation campaign accelerated in October: before, most of  their 

C activities revolved around debunking false news about science, health, food safety, envi-
A ronment, trafficking, and so on. But in October, political topics became prevalent. And 
S most of  the false news were published in simplified Chinese, thus presumably pro-
E duced in mainland China.252 A significant proportion focused on procedural elements,

used (said to invalidate votes for Han Kuo-yu), ballot delivery, counting, etc. These tactics D
U

hoped to cast doubt on the election’s integrity, thus lowering trust in the results. C

This is a tactic used by people who know they will lose: if  an election cannot be T

won, at least try to weaken the winner. Other more topic-based operations targeted O
N

international tourism (accusing the government of  paying tourists), gay marriage, or the 
idea that President Tsai “was profiting off  AIDS” because she invested in biotechnologies. 

In order to spread the idea that even the adminis- C
tration had lost trust in the government, oppo- O
nents published a fake news targeting the N
Presidential Office Secretary-General Chen C

E
Chu (陳菊), a leading DPP figure, saying that an P
investigation from the Ministry of  Justice estab- T
lished that she was corrupt and had stolen 50 bil- S
lion Taiwanese dollars (€1.48 billion) when she 
was Mayor of  Kaohsiung. This rumor was initi-
ated in April 2019 by the Chinese Phoenix press 
agency. The Ministry of  Justice Investigative 
Bureau did deny it in a November press release, A

C
but it was not enough, and the fake news was T
intensely shared during the campaign’s final O

month, in December 2019. And it completely stopped the day after the election, which R
S

confirmed that its goal was indeed to influence the results.253 
Media-based disinformation was present during the campaign. On Facebook, 

DFRLab gave the example of  a CCP-aligned page that spread disinformation on the 
president: “Headlines across the Strait” (@taiwanheadlines 兩岸頭), was still active in 
March 2021, with more than 766,000 followers. Created in 2015, DFRLab noted that it 
underwent a series of  name changes – one indicator of  inauthentic behavior. In October A
2018 (ahead of  the 2016 president election), its first name was “2016 Taiwan Presidential C

T
Election” (台湾大选). Following Tsai Ing-wen’s victory in January 2016, the page became I
“Advice to Tsai Ing-wen” (向蔡英文建言) and was later renamed several times, adapt- O
ing it to the local political context. The owner of  this page is the Chinese company VTV N

S
Internet Technology Jiangsu Limited Co. (微视网络科技江苏有限公). The main share-
holder of  the company is the Elion group, whose chairman of  the board, Wang Wenbiao, 
is a businessman “who also holds [an] important position in the CCP’s Chinese People’s 
Political Consultative Conference, the ‘highest-ranking entity overseeing the United Front 
system’.”254

S Aside from Facebook, Twitter, LINE, and YouTube, other platforms such as PTT,

idential election campaign.255 YouTube can be used to recycle debunked printed fake 
news into videos, and it was used much more than before.256 Several videos, for example, 
questioned the authenticity of  Tsai Ing-wen’s PhD (see screenshot below) – a persist-

A
C ing rumor, already prevalent on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, so much so that the 
T prestigious London School of  Economics (LSE) had to publish a press release in October 
O 2019 to attest that Tsai ing-wen did indeed receive a PhD in law in 1984.257 This campaign 
R
S lasted until after the election, as the idea that her PhD was fake gave legitimacy to 

the notion that the election was fake as well. Thus, on February 21, 2020, a petition 
appeared on the White House website258 “We the People,” titled: “Luc 8:17: we want the 
truth on the Taiwanese president’s fraudulent PhD.”259 This petition was shared profusely 
on social media (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) in Taiwan as well as in the Chinese-
speaking press in the United States,260 as part of  articles or advertisements that called on 

A the Chinese diaspora to sign the petition.261 But, with only 42,347 people signatures in 30 
C
T days, the petition did not reach the 100,000-signature threshold required to be considered 
I by the U.S. government. However, as soon as the petition closed, another petition was 
O created by the same Internet user (L.H.) which claimed that the reason why the petition 
N
S did not meet the required threshold is that it was “hacked” by “Tsai’s hackers,” including 

her minister of  digital affairs Audrey Tang. This second petition asked the White House to 
conduct an investigation – without much success either, it only collected 3,647 signatures 
in 30 days.262

C. Agriculture as a key battleground for disinformation A
C
T

Farmers are a significant voter base in Taiwan and, with the Taiwanese working-class, O
one of  the two groups most supportive of  the current government. They are thus regu- R

S
larly targeted with disinformation in the hope of  turning them against the DPP – oper-
ations in which content farms (→ p. 367) usually play an important role.264 

Banana prices fell in May 2018 due to a rising production, quickly reaching a five-year low 
before the Agricultural Council intervened. But many articles written by content farms sus-
tained and exaggerated the farmer’s “panic.” One article on Mission titled “Pineapple prices 
are bad, bananas also go below the dollar, and seasonal fruits are not good either: farmers A

C
are now panicking,” was largely shared on May 29, 2018 on the Facebook pages “Kaobei T
DPP, Recall the DPP” (罷免民進黨) and “Kaobei Current Events” (靠北時事). Two days I
later, the website China Review, which belongs to the China Review News Agency, created in O

N
Hong Kong in 2005 (a part of  the China Review Group (中国 评论集团) created in 1998), S
published an article on its website in Taiwan quoting a farmer who presumably said that “if  
the Tsai government does not act quickly, we will see if  farmers do not rebel.” This article 
was picked up by the content farm Nooho which merged it with another article and added 
a new title: “if  the DPP does not fall, farmers will be good-for-nothings.” 

The following day, on June 2, an unknown writer on Mission copied and modified an 
article initially published in the Apple Daily Taiwan (蘋果日報), changing its title to “Helen C
Chang [a DPP politician]: it’s China’s fault if  we have an oversupply of  fruits, it’s a mat- A
ter of  national security” and spread it on forums and on Facebook. At the same time, S
Xinhua and the Chinese content farm Meiri Toutiao (每日頭條) wrote that “the Taiwanese E

public opinion believes that the DPP authorities’ refusal to recognize the 1992 consensus 
effectively froze inter-strait relations and severely impacted tourism industries, agricultural 
industries and fishing in Taiwan. The continental market is essential in solving unmarket-
able price declines in Taiwan.” C

E Picture with misleading captions also circulated on social media. On one of  them, pre-
P sumably taken in June 2018, a truck is seen dumping bananas in a ditch in Kaohsiung. 
T
S On LINE, this photo came with comments such as “the media does not dare report that 

the bananas from Qishan and Meinong in Kaohsiung are massively thrown away, every-
thing has been silenced” (高雄旗山美濃的香蕉棄置現場新聞不敢報，一切都新聞封 
鎖), or that a kilo of  bananas was now sold for one dollar (台香蕉一公斤一元). But the 
Taiwanese journalist Li Huiyi (李慧宜) took the picture in 2007 for the 我们的岛 TV 

A show on public television. And to prove that the “recent” photo was a fake, she went back 
C to the exact same spot on June 6, 2018.265 
T Similarly, a picture showing thousands of  pineapples rotting in a pond spread on social 
O
R media in 2018, particularly on LINE, with the same narrative (DPP policies are responsible 
S for declining prices, pushing farmers to throw their production away). In fact, this photo 

had been taken in Xuwen District, in the Zhanjiang city jurisdiction of  Guangdong, in 
mainland China.266 

A year later, the same scenario was repeated: arti-
cles initially published on Mission and then 

A shared on Facebook fan pages divided the 
C Taiwanese society (this time about a story on 
T pesticides and bananas) and Chinese content 
I farms like Meiri Toutiao kept painting China in a 
O
N positive light, claiming it bought Taiwanese goods 
S to help the island’s farmers, who were incidentally 

grateful for that.
For example, on March 8, 2019, in the middle of  
an election campaign – in a move visibly aimed at 
weakening the DPP – the pro-KMT CTi televi-
sion channel aired an interview in which a grape-

C fruit producer said that farmers had poured 200 
A million tons of  grapefruits in the Zengwen reservoir (曾文水库) the previous year.267 The 
S
E interview was immediately picked up by KMT member Hsieh Lung-chieh (謝龍介) who, 

standing behind the presenter, corrected the number because it was too high: he admitted 
it was probably closer to 120 million tons – which remains huge and unconvincing. Later in

In August 2019, an Internet user showed what he considered to be evidence that R
S

President Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP were “selling” Taiwan to Japan and the United States 
in a video shared on YouTube and Facebook.268 He spoke Mandarin with a Taiwanese 
accent and used traditional characters in his video’s subtitles. He even perfectly 
mastered the Taiwanese dialect, so much so that he really seemed to be a native of  
Taiwan. However, the Investigative Bureau of  the Ministry of  Justice revealed that he was 
a Chinese agent spreading fake news.269 A body of  corroborating evidence did indeed A
show that he was a journalist and radio presenter serving the PRC. C

T
In his video, the Internet user contended that DPP members were the descendants of  I

Japanese colonizers who took money away from Taiwanese taxpayers to enrich Japan. He O
said that, according to official numbers from the Ministry of  Economic Affairs, more than N

S
a third of  the trade surplus from business with the PRC was given to Japan. It was meant 
as an irrefutable proof  that DPP members, including Tsai and the Taiwanese representa-
tive in Japan Frank Hsieh (謝長廷), were “sold” to Japan: they were described as inciting 
Taiwanese people to accept imported “radioactive” food from the Fukushima region, that 
Japan struggled to sell abroad. The video’s author also criticized Tsai’s government for 
squandering Taiwanese taxpayer’s money by buying military equipment that “is not even C
working” – a hint at the F-16V bought from the United States. He ended the video by call- A
ing his viewers to make the right choice during the 2020 presidential election. S

This was the first video posted on his YouTube channel and Facebook page “At the E
Foot of  Mount Jade” (玉山腳下), a name referring to the Yu Shan mountain at the center 
of  Taiwan. In two months, the video was liked over a thousand times on each platform, 
shared more than 1,700 times on Facebook, watched more than 15,800 times on YouTube

E. The Li Jie Case (2019)
C
O
N On June 18, 2019, an Internet user called Li Jie (李杰, also transcribed as “Li Chieh”) 
C circulated a text on several Facebook groups stating that the Tsai administration had given 
E 1 billion Taiwanese dollars (€29.5 million) to support the “violent” protests in Hong Kong, 
P
T but that it had refused to give anything for the prevention and the fight against dengue fever 
S in Kaohsiung (see screenshots below). 

His posts gathered between 600 and 800 “likes” on the groups, and they were shared 
between 300 and 800 times, all within less than 24 hours. The Taiwanese authorities 
refuted the claim as early as the next day, opened an investigation, and revealed that 
the IP address belonged to an Internet user who had already been reported for a sim-

A ilar initiative the year before.284 Li Jie’s profile was thus suspended, and his posts were 
C
T deleted. From screenshots captured before he was suspended, we learned that Li Jie 
O had signed up to Facebook in July 2018 and presented himself  as an inhabitant of  
R Kaohsiung.

cized how Han Kuo-yu dealt with the crisis.285

This lost opportunity, for China, was quickly followed by a new opportunity for dis-
information: the Covid-19 pandemic. It was all the more important that, in Taiwan, 
information manipulation had focused on health issues more than on politics in 
recent years, as Audrey Tang explained: “most viral rumors are not political, they are

about food safety, they are about health […] That is dominant.”291 In other words, the D
U

Taiwanese society was particularly vulnerable to the Covid-19 “Infodemic.” C

In late February and early March 2020, “Chinese users organized a coordi- T
I

nated disinformation campaign to smear the Taiwanese government on Facebook, O
N

Twitter, and YouTube. Rumors spread included that the government was covering up 
domestic cases of  the coronavirus, the DPP was profiting off  of  the disease, and bodies 
were being burned en masse or buried secretly in construction sites. Chinese Weibo users C
openly bragged about spreading these rumors on Facebook.”292 On Twitter, the hashtag O
#台湾肺炎 (Taiwan pneumonia) was used to make people believe that the virus was N
Taiwanese. Chinese media also defended the idea that Taiwanese authorities used the C

E
health crisis to pursue political independence (以疫谋独) but that this “shameful ploy” P
would end in bitter failure.293 The announcement of  a Taiwan-United States partnership T
to combine their efforts in the fight the pandemic (台美防疫伙伴关系) and Taiwan’s S
subsequent donation of  10,000 masks a week to the United States triggered a surge of  crit-
icisms from China. In an op-ed widely shared across Chinese networks, Xinhua described 
the decision as a political maneuver by Taiwan to get closer to the U.S. at the expense of  
its population’s well-being, an act depicted as treason. How could the DPP give so many 
masks to the United States when the Taiwanese population had trouble finding any? Xinhua A

C
condemned Taiwan’s policy of  being “distrustful toward China but not the United States or T
Europe” (只防大陆，不防欧美). This policy, which they described as “hating China and O
flattering the United States,” was “even more harmful than the virus” (仇中媚美 比病毒 R

S
更毒) according to the media.294

This campaign also contained interesting cases of  
image and identity theft. On several occasions the 
accounts spreading these rumors portrayed themselves as 
established media: for example, @APChinese_ (an 
account since suspended by Twitter) used the logo of  the A
Associated Press as a profile picture. In a tweet posted C

T
February 28 (see image), this account, which posed as a I
Chinese branch of  the Associated Press, accused the gov- O
ernment of  hiding Covid-19 deaths and illustrated its N

S
point with a hijacked picture of  corpses (captured in 2006 
and showing the victims of  an Indonesian earthquake).

In the second half  of  March 2020, the Investigation Bureau of  the Ministry of  Justice 
organized a press conference to announce that 196 (72%) of  the 271 cases of  disinfor-
mation on the pandemic for which an investigation had been opened had originated 
in China: “Chinese users prepare messages aimed at the Taiwanese public, they C
co-ordinate the manner in which these messages are spread, then they use fake A
accounts to spread the messages on Taiwanese Facebook groups.”295 S

U Among those cases were false testimonies which all followed a formulaic blueprint: 
C “My father is a city councilor and another council member told him that Taiwan actually 
T
I has more than 500 cases of  Covid-19 and 200 related deaths” (elements of  the formula 
O
N like “my father” or “councilor” sometimes changed to give the impression of  a variety of  

sources). One could also find doctored screenshots of  Taiwanese TV channels and fake 
Taiwanese governmental press releases.296

C One of  the most persistent rumors in subsequent weeks was that of  a (fake) racist 
O Taiwanese campaign against the director general of  the WHO. On April 8, Tedros 
N Ghebreyeus, who is known to be close to the CCP (→ p. 213), declared during a press con-
C
E ference that he was the target of  a racist campaign on social media that had been going on 
P for months and he accused Taiwan of  being its instigator.297 President Tsai and the Taiwanese 
T Ministry of  Foreign Affairs immediately denied having anything to do with the campaign. 
S Two days later, in the midst of  numerous messages of  apology posted by Taiwanese users on 

social media, the Investigation Bureau of  the Ministry of  Justice declared that these accounts 
were in fact Chinese, and not Taiwanese. The investigators noted the existence of  numerous 
identical messages to prove that this was a coordinated operation, as shown by the screenshots 
below. These messages frequently appeared on a false account modelled on that of  Radio 

A
C Free Asia in order to spread confusion.298 The ASPI showed that 60% of  the 65 accounts 
T diffusing these messages of  apology in traditional Chinese had previously tweeted in 
O simplified Chinese, which seemed to indicate that their owners were Chinese from 
R
S the mainland hoping to pose as Taiwanese.299 The whole campaign was apparently a 

Chinese operation meant to weaken Taiwan’s position. This seemed to be confirmed 
by the rapidity with which officials from the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs expressed 
support for the director general of  the WHO, and by the mobilization of  the patriotic rap 
group CD REV which published a video clip about the scandal on April 14. The song entitled 
“Mr. Virus is warning us!” took up the idea of  a racist Taiwanese campaign against the head 

A of  the WHO.300

Examples of  identical messages (thus indicating a coordinated campaign). Translation: “I am Taiwanese  O
and I am terribly ashamed of  the Taiwanese who attacked Tedros in such a vicious way.  R
On behalf  of  the Taiwanese people, I apologize to Tedros and ask him to forgive me.” S

The campaign had probabaly a twofold objective. A long-term objective first: 
Beijing could not prevent the re-election of  Tsai but it could try to discredit her 
and the DPP while undermining the confidence of  the population in its govern-
ment’s actions. And a short-term objective: to make people forget Taiwan’s excel-
lent handling of  the pandemic, which could be interpreted by some observers as a A

C
demonstration of  the virtues of  the model of  liberal democracy, especially in terms of  T
the circulation of  information. Indeed, Taiwan was seldom affected by the pandemic I
(there were very few cases, no necessary nation-wide lockdown and citizens kept living O
normal lives even in crowded entertainment venues) and, even worse for the CCP, in N

S
2020, Taiwan’s GDP growth (+2.98%) was greater than China’s (+2.3%) for the first 
time since 1991. Furthermore, Taiwan had never been more internationally visible and 
president Tsai’s popularity broke records – these factors merely exacerbated Beijing’s 
resentment.

The deteriorating health situation on the island in the spring of  2021 therefore pro-
vided the CCP with an opportunity. Numbers remained very low compared to other coun- C
tries, but there was an epidemic outbreak in May 2021. This was accompanied by an A
“Infodemic” outbreak, a spike in informational attacks presumably created and/or S
amplified by mainland Chinese actors.301 E

U G. Diplomatic Relations
C
T
I Diplomatic relations, along with military affairs, are more often used in the psychologi-
O
N cal warfare (see the case of  military exercises → p. 478), but they can also be at the center 

of  the dissemination of  false information. Here are four examples. First, in 2018, as 
Taiwan had just lost its diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso, a user of  the Taiwanese social 

C media platform PTT spread the rumor that the Foreign Affairs Minister of  Honduras was 
O currently in Beijing negotiating the conditions for breaking its diplomatic relations with 
N
C Taiwan in the next 48 hours and that Haiti would follow suit. This created a wave of  panic 
E in Taiwanese diplomatic circles until the Honduran minister denied the rumor.302 Beijing’s 
P objective is to maintain a permanent insecurity and tension over Taiwan’s diplo-
T matic relations by wooing away its few diplomatic allies one by one and by manip-
S

ulating information to heighten its anxieties.
Second, in the course of  the summer 2018 a rumor spread on social media, mostly on 

LINE, according to which Air Canada would no longer recognize Taiwanese passports 
after July 25 – the rumor picked up in intensity and forced the Minister of  Foreign Affairs 

A to publish a press release to deny it.303 It is true, however, that more and more airline com-
C panies and airports are giving in to Beijing’s pressure to categorize Taiwanese booking as 
T Chinese and Taiwanese cities as destinations inside China. Nevertheless, a Taiwanese pass-
O
R port remains valid and gives visa-free access to far more countries (145) than a Chinese 
S passport (75).304 In fact, Taiwan announced in early September 2020 the removal of  the 

appelation “Republic of  China” (the official name of  Taiwan, which can lead to confusion) 
from its new passports, to avoid any ambiguity and to resist Chinese pressure. This conces-
sion should be put into perspective, as the Chinese wording (中華民國) remains present 
and the one in English appears inside the passports.

Third, the Taiwanese Minister of  Foreign Affairs was forced to intervene to put an end 
A
C to an insistent rumor spread by the Chinese website xilu.com that Taiwan was planning 
T to lease the Taiping Island (Itu Aba) to the United States. This is the largest of  the 
I Spratly Islands, a disputed archipelago in the South China Sea.305 In the context of  a Sino-
O
N American “Cold War,” misinformation tied to the United States will certainly become 
S more prevalent, to increase inter-strait tensions and ultimately provide a pretext for 

Beijing to intervene. 
Fourth, to kill two birds with one stone, turning the Taiwanese population against its 

own government and an allied state, Beijing also spreads fake news aimed not only at the 
United States but also at Japan. For example, in April 2021, a fake memo from the Office 
of  the President stating that the Taiwanese government had agreed to receive contaminated 

C (nuclear) water from Fukushima circulated on Facebook. The real origin of  the memo was 
A easy to discover as it contained simplified Chinese characters. The president’s spokesperson 
S immediately denounced the maneuver, calling it “cognitive warfare” and President Tsai also 
E

published a denial on Facebok:

The ICAO’s Twitter account
Late January 2020 several Twitter users found that their accounts had been blocked by 
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) after posting tweets on the agen-
cy’s policy toward Taiwan. A
The ICAO was then headed by Liu Fang, one of  the Chinese nationals in charge of  one of  the C
15 UN specialized agencies (→ p. 206). Since her arrival at the head of  this agency, the ICAO T
has stopped inviting Taiwan to participate in its tri-annual assembly.306 This exclusion has O
led to criticisms at the onset of  the Covid-19 pandemic. Several people expressed regrets R
on Twitter that Taiwan was not included in the exchanges with ICAO members, even S
though Taoyuan airport is a major hub for airport connections in the region, with more than 
72 million passengers transiting every year toward more than 150 cities across the world.307 
The polemic grew with the reactions of  Jessica Drun, a non-resident member of  Project 2049, 
who posted the following tweet on January 22: “Want to drive the point home that two orgs, 
@WHO & @icao, refuse to share knowledge w/ Taiwan authorities. This means civil aviation 
authorities for one of  busiest regional airports do not receive up-to-date info on any potential 
ICAO-WHO efforts.”308 A
A few days later, on January 25, she brought attention to the fact that she had been blocked C
by the ICAO’s Twitter account even though she was not calling for recognition of  T
Taiwan as a member of  the ICAO, but only for Taiwan’s inclusion in the talks.309 I
Numerous other users – think-tank analysts, academics, journalists and other observers – also O
noticed that they had been blocked by the agency after criticizing Taiwan’s exclusion.310 N
Beyond the symbolism of  this gesture, the effect was that these users could no longer consult S
the publications of  the agency’s account.
The ICAO went even further by blocking users who simply referred to the affair, such 
as Alex Dukalskis, associate professor at University College Dublin and China Fellow at the 
Wilson Center. Dukalskis revealed that, after writing to the ICAO, following its advice, he 
was asked to criticize himself  to have a chance of  having his Twitter account unblocked: “If  
you could therefore firstly reassure me that you recognize you were mistaken in your earlier 
questions and posts, and secondly confirm that you were not aware that your activities were 
augmenting risks to the safety and security of  our staff, we’d be willing to reconsider re-es- C
tablishing your ability to post your personal opinions on our account.”311 A
The ICAO’s immunity – originally conceived to protect international organizations from S
state interference – does not allow these decisions to be challenged in court. But this behavior E

C IV. Armed Force
T
O Beijing has always used military exercises – for the impact they have in their 
R
S own right and for the ease with which they can be exaggerated in the media – as 

a means of  psychological warfare against Taiwan – particularly (but not solely) 
during elections, as a way to influence, or at least to send a message to the win-
ners. For instance, between July 1995 and June 1996, with the presidential election sched-
uled for March 23, 1996, China organized no fewer than six military exercises aimed at 
the island, firing missiles into the sea a few dozen kilometers away from the Taiwanese 

A coast. Not long before, in 1994, while a novel anticipating a Chinese invasion of  Taiwan 
C
T one year later became one of  the island’s best-sellers,317 Beijing was conducting its biggest 
I military exercises in years.
O Military pressure has intensified since Tsai Ing-wen’s election in 2016, an admis-
N
S sion that the Chinese soft power failed to win the hearts and minds of  Taiwan’s 

population. The PLA regularly simulates an invasion of  the island. For example, 
in August 2020, in response to what Beijing saw as an American provocation (the U.S. 
Secretary of  Health and Human Services visited Taiwan), the PLA conducted amphibious 
landing exercises. The PLA actually has a full-scale replica of  a part of  downtown Taipei on 
the military base of  Zhurihe, which includes the Taiwanese presidential palace and has been 

C used to simulate assaults.318 Intrusions into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone 
A (ADIZ) have multiplied in recent years. And 2020 was saw a record 380 incursions by

Chinese aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ.319 Beijing stepped up its activities immediately after D
U

President Tsai’s re-election, as if  to send a signal. The first quarter of  2021 confirmed C

that the pressure is still mounting, with two large Chinese air sorties on March 26 and T
I

April 12, the latter involving 25 aircrafts simultaneously.320 These violations usually grow O
N

more intense during particular events over which Beijing wishes to exert its influence, such 
as the Taiwanese national holiday (October 10), diplomatic visits (as in September 2020, 
with the visit of  the U.S. Under Secretary of  State for Economic Growth, Energy and the C
Environment), or during the inauguration of  the new U.S. president. Between January 23 O
and 25, for instance, a few days int Joe Biden’s presidency, Beijing tested the president’s N
resolve by sending 13 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ the first day, 15 on the second, and 15 C

E
on the third, a record number since September 2020.321 On September 23, 2021, and while P
it expressed disapproval of  Taiwan’s accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the T
Party-State sent 24 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. These massive sorties are becoming more S
and more frequent, and intimidating, with a clear acceleration since October 1, 2021 (the 
PRC’s National Day): 145 Chinese planes entered Taiwan’s ADIZ in 4 days (38 on 
October 1, which was already an absolute record, then 39 on the 2nd, 16 on the 3rd and 52 
on the 4th).322

As J. Michael Cole explained, this “latest militarization of  Beijing’s posture comprises A
C

two main vectors – increased PLA activity and preparedness in the vicinity of  Taiwan, com- T
bined with a sustained campaign of  psychological warfare against the Taiwanese govern- O
ment and public.”323 Indeed, these exercises are generally accompanied by a bellicose R

S
rhetoric from Chinese media, which exaggerate their scale and significance. In April 
2018, relatively minor scheduled exercises were taking place off  the coast of  Quanzhou 
in the province of  Fujian, but the Chinese press turned them into “live fire drills to check 
‘Taiwan Independence,’” as the Global Times headlined.324 J. Michael Cole also noted that 
these exercises “were ostensibly timed to coincide with a visit to Swaziland by President 
Tsai Ing-wen.”325 In August 2020, the Global Times described military exercises “not A
[as a] warning but [as a] rehearsal for [a] Taiwan takeover” by the PLA, which was C

T
deemed inevitable.326 Confirming the crushing superiority of  the PLA and its capacity I
to attack the island from all sides, the unabashed objective of  these exercises is to “deter O
Taiwan secessionists.”327 Hence, military exercises targeting Taiwan are increasingly N

S
frequent and the propaganda that accompanies them is growing more aggressive.

The purpose of  these daily intrusions and this constant pressure is not only meant to 
create a permanent threat in the Taiwanese minds, or even a sense of  inevitability for 
a Chinese invasion, but to create the conditions for an incident which would likely end 
badly. Pierre Haski explained that “[the] risk is not, at least not yet, a deliberate trigger of

U war, but rather an incident that can trigger a series of  events which would be difficult to 
C stop.”328 The Taiwanese are aware of  this and remain calm: they know they are targeted by 
T
I operations of  psychological warfare and that the mistake, the excuse Beijing is waiting 
O
N for, would be to offer an overreaction paving the way for an escalation.329

One case is particularly instructive. On December 16, 2016, the PLA Air Force (PLAAF)’s 
Weibo account published a picture of  an airborne (nuclear-capable) H-6 bomber, reg-

C istered under the number 20019 (which indicated it belonged to the 10th Bomber Division 
O based in Anqing330). On the picture one could see two mountains in the distance peaking 
N above a sea of  clouds (Figure 1).331
C
E Chinese Internet users quickly put forward a first hypothesis: the two peaks in the back-
P ground could be part of  the Jade Mountain, also called Yushan (玉山), which culminates at 
T 3,952 meters and is located on the island of  Taiwan, in Nantou County. Hence, by analyzing 
S the orientation of  the two peaks, some Internet users believed that the bomber was coming 

from the north and heading south and that therefore the picture was taken by the PLAAF 
during a drill around Taiwan on November 25.332 Others suggested that it was more likely 
the long-distance surveillance exercise of  December 10.333

two days earlier, which showed the plane in the same position but from a different angle, C

it revealed not two but three peaks in the background (Figure 2). And a second hypothe- T
I

sis was then laid out – about another Taiwanese mountain, Mount Beidawushan (北大武 O
N

山), which culminates at 3,902 meters, and is located on the southern tip of  the island in 
Pintung County.334

On December 17, 2016, the Taiwanese Ministry of  Defense denied that the picture C
showed Mount Yushan.335 In fact, as Mount Yushan is 50 km away from the sea and around O
200 km inside the ADIZ, the proportions of  the aircraft in relation to the mountain sug- N
gested that if  it were Mount Yushan, the picture had to have been taken from inside the C

E
Taiwanese ADIZ.336 One Internet user suggested that the picture was taken at a distance P
of  100-150 km from the Mount (Figure 3).337 But two complementary counter-arguments T
were advanced by Taiwan: if  this was indeed the silhouette of  Mount Yushan then the S
proportions in the picture had to have been doctored, or it could simply have been a dif-
ferent mountain, such as Beidawushan, which is closer to the sea.338 The reluctance of  the 
Taiwanese authorities to recognize that the PLAAF’s picture was taken from the eastern 
coast of  Taiwan was understandable since it reinforced the idea that the PLA was capable 
of  attacking the island from all sides.339 A

C In April 2018, the PLAAF’s Weibo account posted a 4-minute promotional video in 
T
I which a scene had clearly been taken from the preceding photos (Figure 4). This was not an 
O
N isolated case: the Chinese Air Force frequently posts photos and videos of  its fighters 

around Taiwan, to keep the pressure up. This is a typical illustration of  psychological 
warfare. Whether the picture had been taken from Mount Yushan or not, the harm was 

C done as doubt was sowed in the Taiwanese public opinion. The goal was to under-
O mine the Taiwanese people’s trust in their armed forces’ ability to track PLA move-
N ments, to react quickly, defend the territorial sovereignty of  the island and protect 
C
E the people from a PRC attack. “The photos send a message […] to Taiwan’s citizens, 
P to highlight the inability of  their government to stop such flights. […]. When two H-6Ks 
T entered Taiwan’s ADIZ during the July 20th flight, the Chinese pilots said they and the

S Another way for Beijing to exert military pressure on Taiwan is to spread false 

or biased news that would constitute a casus belli if  they were proven accurate. For 
instance, a rumor suggested that American military planes were using Taiwanese bases: in 
August 2020 Internet users claimed that a U.S. Navy Lockheed EP-3 electronic warfare and 
reconnaissance aircraft had landed in Taiwan and taken off  several times.342 The news was 
spread on social media, most notably by the South China Sea Probing Initiative (SCSPI).343 It 

C was then taken up by the Global Times, which quoted the SCSPI and, as usual, issued threats 
A as to the consequences for Taiwan if  this was proven true: it would amount to “crossing a 
S
E red line” and Beijing could “destroy the relevant airport on the island and the US military 

aircraft that land there – a war in the Taiwan Straits [would] thus begin.” The newspaper 
demanded to the Taiwanese and U.S. authorities to avoid “[playing] with fire,” and it went 
further, recommending that “Beijing officially declare the ‘airspace’ over the Taiwan Island

as a patrol area of  the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The PLA’s reconnaissance aircraft D
U

and fighter jets will perform missions over Taiwan Island [to] check whether there are US C

military planes landing at Taiwan’s airports or US warships docking at the island’s ports. If  T
I

the island’s military dares to fire the first shot at the PLA’s aircraft, it will mean provocation O
N

of  a war, and the PLA should immediately destroy Taiwan’s military forces and achieve 
reunification through military means.”344

The initial information on the presence of  U.S. military planes on the island had no C
factual basis and it was denied by the Taiwanese authorities. As Cole noted, the SCSPI on O
which the Global Times based its threats is not a neutral actor, despite the fact that N
it presents itself  as such: the group has ties to the University of  Beijing. The direc- C

E
tor of  the SCSPI, Hu Bo (胡波), is also the director for the Center of  Maritime Strategic P
Studies at the University of  Beijing. One of  the members of  the SCSPI’s board of  director T
is the president of  the National Institute for South China Sea Studies (NISCSS, 中国南海 S
研究院). The SCSPI and the NISCSS are regularly used as “platforms to support Beijing’s 
territorial claims.”345

What is certain is that the method is well established: false or biased information 
emerges on social media or on various forums, preferably with no visible link to the 
CCP and is taken up and amplified by Chinese media, generally the Global Times, A

C
which issues threats. This method may vary from full-fledged operations built from T
scratch, for example when Chinese intelligence plants the initial information, to O
sheer opportunism when the media identifies any piece of  information that could be R

S
damaging to Taiwan, irrespective of  its origin.

V. Conclusion
A

The Chinese political warfare against Taiwan has won a few tactical victories to C
the extent that it has contributed to polarizing the Taiwanese society and, thus, con- T
vinced a section of  the public opinion that “Taiwan’s real enemy was the opposite camp I

O
(the DPP) rather than the authoritarian regime across the Taiwan Strait.”346 Additionally, N
it “may have helped a few politicians to get elected.”347 Some seduction methods, S
notably through the business community, can work but others appear to be ineffective. 
This is notably the case in the Taiwanese academic world which is well educated about the 
Chinese threat and its methods: those who have been targeted by state-sponsored influence 
peddling (luxurious trips to continental China, indoctrination sessions supervised by CCP 
executives), returned without being converted by Chinese efforts and, if  anything, rather 
sarcastic about them, according to Cole: “I’ve had several interviews with the Taiwanese C
academics who went on these trips to China, they come back and they tell me: ̀ we had great A

S
food, the hotel was nice […]. But did they succeed in brainwashing me or convincing me E
that I’m something that I’m not? Absolutely not’. And they normally laugh it off  saying that 
the Chinese are spending a lot of  money on these activities, and that the actual div-
idends are quite minimal.”348 The Chinese probably know that these measures are

U not efficient; their justification is found only in the mechanisms of  the Party-State 
C apparatus: certain operations are in fact the product of  an administrative logic as 
T
I civil servants hope to show their hierarchy that they are doing something. 
O
N Strategically, this is a failure. In fact, the Chinese political warfare that targets 

Taiwan has been counterproductive: incentives and punitive measures under Xi Jinping 
have not produced the expected results; the majority of  the Taiwanese population still 

C approves of  the president and the DPP and is even more distrustful of  China than before. 
O Beijing has even lost the KMT, which was once a useful CCP relay and is now distancing 
N itself  from China and vice versa (Beijing said it “will no longer rely on the KMT”).349 Besides, 
C
E the 2020 presidential campaign confirmed the KMT’s loss of  influence and the need for 
P Beijing to rely on other channels, usually not political parties, to reach out to the population, 
T and especially to the younger generations (China has lost its attractiveness among them 
S because of  the China-US trade war and of  the Hong Kong crisis). Moreover, the nation-

alist sentiment is rising: the number of  people identifying as “only Taiwanese” has never 
been higher (67%).350 The Hong Kong crisis has much to do with this since it played 
a role as a powerful turnoff. Taiwan’s government subsequently adopted a series of  
measures to combat interference – especially Chinese interference – which should make 

A
C influence peddling more difficult in the future. This also reinforced the Taiwanese govern-
T ment’s determination to reduce its dependence on China and to diversify its economy 
O – in particular in the sectors used by Beijing (i.e. tourism) to exert pressure.
R
S Overall, Beijing’s mounting aggressiveness in recent years, against Taiwan and 

globally, has considerably increased the island’s attractiveness. Without gaining any 
formal diplomatic allies, Taiwan has seen its relations with the US strengthened with 
the visit of  the US Secretary of  Health in August 2020 (the highest ranking US official to 
visit the island since 1979), of  an Under Secretary of  State in September, and with the cre-
ation of  a U.S. F-16 maintenance center, the only one in East Asia. The visit of  an impres-

A sive Czech delegation in late August 2020 also brought international attention to the island 
C
T while incurring Beijing’s wrath. In a word, Chinese efforts to weaken and isolate Taiwan 
I have had the opposite effect of  what they intended.

From Taiwan to Hong Kong and Back T
I

What has been the link between Taiwan and Hong Kong since the beginning of  the O
Hong Kong crisis? Are the Chinese using the same methods and content in Taiwan as N

they have in Hong Kong, or vice-versa? Both probably. There seems to be an adaptive 
recycling of  methods and content. On the one hand, the Hong Kong crisis contributed 
to shaping the narratives used against Taiwan, such as the rumor according to which “the 
Taiwanese government is interfering in the Hong-Kong crisis – by offering financial support” C
(a Facebook post asserted that President Tsai Ing-wen spent a billion Taiwanese dollars (€29.5 O
million) to finance the protests in Hong Kong, all the while refusing to finance the fight against N
a dengue outbreak that afflicted the south of  Taiwan), or tactical support (the pro-Beijing press C
in Hong Kong, picking up in Taiwan, claimed that Taiwanese agents were spotted advising the E
protesters on the best way to face off  against the police).351 More generally the Hong Kong cri- P
sis has not really had an impact on the frequency and the intensity of  the informational attacks T
against Taiwan: Beijing has the resources to operate on both fronts. However, the crisis has S
had an impact on the narratives as they now focus less on unification (a delicate subject during 
the Hong Kong crisis) and more on Taiwan’s internal issues (social problems).
On the other hand, among the 13.8 million tweets identified by Twitter in August and September 
2019 as part of  a pro-Beijing operation against Hong Kong, Taiwan was an issue. There were 
attempts to promote Taiwanese pro-unification leaders such as the journalist Joyce Huang (黃
智賢) or the politician Wang Ping-chung (王炳忠), both known to have worked with Chinese A
intelligence, something confirmed by several criminal investigations.352 Also, China seeming- C
ly used its Taiwanese allies to intervene in Hong Kong, because they could use traditional T
Chinese characters. They were less susceptible to make mistakes than Chinese individuals from O
the PRC, thus making them harder to detect. R

HONG KONG PROTESTERS IN 2019

Hong Kong was retroceded to China in 1997 after an agreement between the United P
Kingdom and the PRC that preserved the existing political system in Hong Kong for 50 T

S
more years (in conformity with the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s “constitution”). This arrange-
ment is commonly known as the “One Country, Two Systems,” and the island became a 
“Special Administrative Region” (特别行政区–SAR) with its own judicial and political 
system. The PRC’s authority is represented by the Liaison Office of  the Central People’s 
Government in the Hong Kong SAR (中央人民政府驻香港特别行政区联络办公), aka A
the Liaison Office. C

Throughout the winter of  2019 a bill on extraditions to China angered the population, T
which began to protest against it. The movement intensified as the police repressed them. O

R
The June 16 protests gathered a record two million people according to the organizers, but S
confrontations with the police became more violent. And tensions culminated during 
the summer and fall of  2019. In this context, Beijing conducted a number of  influ-
ence and disinformation operations against protesters using three narrative lines: sup-
port for the police and the Hong Kong government, attacks against the reputation of  
protesters, and accusations of  foreign interference.1-2

On the ground, the Chinese regime proved unable to anticipate the size of  an opposi-
tion or to understand the movement’s evolution and the meteoric decline of  executive head 
Carrie Lam’s standing in the public opinion. The failure of  the Liaison Office’s representa-
tive was also obvious. In this regard, images of  protesters surrounding the Liaison Office 
and trampling the PRC’s flag were seen as a clear affront to the CCP. Surprised by the C
scale of  the protests and the inability of  Lam’s government to restore order, the CCP was A
forced to react quickly. The Party’s margin for maneuver was slim however since Hong S
Kong remains largely autonomous and a direct coercive action would only have come at a E

high political price, detrimental to the CCP’s public image – and completely demonetizing

T
I Faced with this humiliation that rapidly tested the Chinese regime’s capacity to restore 
O
N its authority – in China strictly speaking as much as in Hong Kong or within its population 

– Beijing’s response turned to the informational sphere.
Beijing’s counter-attack faced three challenges. Its discourse had to address three tar-

C get audiences simultaneously: (1) mainland public opinion, which was the easiest to 
O channel, as information is tightly controlled behind “the Great Chinese Firewall” with 
N the Propaganda Department setting the tone and Chinese media falling behind; (2) Hong 
C
E Kong’s public opinion, and more generally the Chinese diaspora, especially in North 
P America and Europe; and (3) the non-Chinese-speaking international public opinion.
T The challenge for China was to retain a minimum of  its capital for sympathy: the 
S protests indeed attracted the attention of  foreign media to the situation in Hong Kong and 

naturally to the management of  the crisis by the Party. However, the Chinese government 
was facing a complex international environment, under growing criticisms and hostility with 
the “trade war” it faces with the U.S. administration, the backlash against its colonization 
policy in Xinjiang and its increasingly brazen constraints on public liberties for instance. 

A
C Beijing’s real margin for maneuver was slimmer than appeared at first glance.
T The regime’s objective was to spread counter-narratives that could be heard and 
O accepted by all three audiences. The channels and languages used to diffuse these nar-
R
S ratives were numerous. On the one hand, in the Chinese-speaking world, Beijing essentially 

used sealed-off  ecosystems like WeChat, Weibo and Douyin (the continental version of  
TikTok), in which only content that conform to the mainland’s laws and rules can circulate 
(→ p. 196). These platforms are widely used by overseas Chinese and constitute an efficient 
way to influence the diasporas. On the other hand, to shape international public opinion 
Beijing mostly used U.S. platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, banned in China, 

A and the Chinese TikTok. Social media occupied an important role in the Chinese commu-
C
T nication strategy regarding Hong Kong but traditional media were not neglected either.

S II. The Chinese media’s narrative

The Chinese government’s spokespeople often complain about the foreign media cover-
age of  the PRC. This coverage is often considered to be too negative and too ignorant of  
the successes of  the Communist Party to focus on “smear” campaigns instead. This tactic 
or posture as a victim, which consists in criticizing the coverage of  China in western 

C media, is the main – and most commonly used – method to influence a public opinion. The 
A
S target audience is just as much that of  China as that of  the diaspora and sometimes even 
E certain fringes of  the international public opinion (the far left and the far right in European 

liberal democracies for example).
On the continent the Party can rely on its well-oiled propaganda apparatus and 

its network of  censors to steer the public’s attitude to the protests. David Bandurski from 
the China Media Project analyzed the methods and narratives used to achieve this goal on the 

C continent.3 Along with big official daily newspapers, he noted the importance of  numerous 
O
N WeChat accounts massively posting “low quality” articles or junk propaganda. These articles

serve to inflame public opinions through carefully selected and powerfully divisive content D
U

(desacralized flag, imputing acts of  violence to protesters or even “proof ” of  foreign inter- C

ference– most notably from the CIA). This content, largely spread on the web, can be lik- T

In Hong Kong, however, the Chinese government could not directly censor or influ- C

ence the protesters’ media narrative. The Liaison Office did have relays in public opin- T
O

ion inasmuch as it had acquired publishing houses or formed close links with a number R
of  daily newspapers and tabloids beforehand,5 but the CCP could not control flows S
of  information on social media as it did on mainland platforms. Besides, Beijing 
announced its decisions, at least officially, to let the Hong Kong government handle the 
protests. All the declarations from the Liaison Office, or from the general secretary of  the 
CCP Xi Jinping, displayed the “CCP’s confidence in the Hong Kong government.” The 
Party-State’s actions kept a low profile and strived to unite the “loyalist” forces with a A
dual strategy: forcing the hand of  Hong Kong’s institutions (firms like Cathay Pacific, C
the Mass Transit Railway or the Ministry of  Justice for instance) but also playing the long- T
term game of  letting the opposition movement wither away, collapse or be discredited I

O
because of  the protesters’ violence and radicalization. N

The channels used to get this type of  messages through varied. Aside from the declara- S
tions of  official representatives and organized protests against certain TV channels (illus-
trated by the 41-page letter sent in late August 2019 to prominent international newspapers 
and press agencies),6 the task of  amplifying the message was mostly assigned to offi-
cial Chinese media.7 For instance, a Google search for “Hong Kong media coverage 
biased” returned several videos posted mainly in August 2019 by CGTN, CCTV or even 
China News. C

S Another example of  this type of  content designed to spread Beijing’s narrative was ana-

lyzed by David Bandurski.9 On August 1, 2019, the PLA broadcast a video from a training 
of  its Hong Kong garrison on Chinese public television. This video, which showed PLA 
soldiers training to disperse protesters by force, was widely taken up by the “pro-Beijing” 
opinion as a guarantee that the “motherland” would not abandon the “loyalists,” but also by 

A the protesters themselves to illustrate the threat China represented. The video was shared 
C by several official accounts (PLA, China Daily) in English and Chinese, totaling tens of  
T thousands of  views. It is still available today. In fact, the threat of  an armed intervention 
O
R was used recurrently as part of  a Chinese strategy of  gradually imposing more pressure 
S on protesters, as testified by the announcements made on August 12,1018,11and 28.12

The state media’s strategy seemingly favored shocking content that could catch the 
attention, spark a debate and generate views. For example, a TV clip compared Hong 
Kong protesters with jihadist terrorists for the way they presumably instrumentalized 
children (see the screenshot below).13 Posted on Facebook in mid-September, this video 

A was later broadcast by the main Chinese media channels (Global Times, China Daily, etc.).

for the violence.

O Jimmy Sham’s “self-mutilation”
R On October 16, the activist Jimmy Sham, who had organized numerous peaceful protests that 
S rallied several hundred thousand Hongkongers, was targeted and beaten by a group of  men 

armed with hammers and iron bars. On October 19, Guancha posted a video entitled “Jimmy 
Sham’s self-mutilation” (岑子杰的苦肉计 – “kurouji” which means “to wound oneself  to 
gain the enemy’s trust”).16 The video shows the blood-stained scene of  the attack with Jimmy 
Sham lying on the ground. Then Sham was shown at the hospital the day after the attack, smil-
ing. The innuendo was clear: if  he had been as gravely wounded as he claimed how could he 
only have had a little plaster on his forehead and be seen smiling, as if  he had never felt better?

The massive disinformation campaign organized by China is most visible on 
Twitter. On August 19, 2019, the same day as Facebook (which had been tipped off  by 
Twitter), the platform made public a “significant state-backed information opera-
tion”: the company explained that it had deleted around 200,000 fake accounts implicated 
in a campaign meant to “[undermine] the legitimacy and political positions of  the [Hong 
Kong] protest movement” and it published the archives of  the 936 most active of  these C
accounts, all “originating from within the PRC.”22 A month later, on September 20, A
Twitter published the archives of  another batch of  4,301 accounts, which were also among S

E
the most active in this operation.23

Several research teams have analyzed the data published by Twitter. In this summary we used 
the analysis of  the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) and those of  two indepen-
dent data scientists, one known only under his pseudonym “AirMovingDevice,” the other, Chua

U China Hong, based in Singapore. Particularly quick to respond, the ASPI published its report, 
C Tweeting through the Great Firewall, on September 3, only two weeks after the data was published by 
T
I Twitter.24 The report dweals on the means used by Beijing to build its disinformation campaign 
O
N as well as its targets, but does not confine itself  to Hong Kong since it gies examples of  older 

campaigns targeting political opponents such as Guo Wengui and Gui Minhai.

C 1. A Typology of  the accounts involved in the disinformation campaign
O
N First preliminary observation: this campaign was conducted in haste. The ASPI 
C noted that the operators behind the surge did not take the time to build credible digital 
E
P identities, unlike the Russian operators who had attacked the presidential campaign in 2016. 
T Of  course the difference is that the calendar for the U.S. election was pre-established, 
S allowing the attackers to prepare their operations several years in advance and to patiently 

build an “infrastructure of  influence,” whereas the Hong Kong crisis was unexpected and 
evolved quickly. The modus operandi of  the disinformation campaign had to be adapted at 
the last moment, taking “shortcuts” to buy time, such as purchasing existing accounts for 
instance, which made the operation quite easy to detect.25

A Two types of  Twitter accounts used against Hong Kong protesters need to be 
C
T analyzed separately: on the one hand, there were “mercenaries,” which previously used 
O different languages (English, Indonesian, Korean, Japanese, Russian) to post content ranging 
R from English football to pornographic messages (sex dating websites, escort services), or 
S even information about Korean boy bands. Having been bought, these accounts changed 

their language and cause overnight, thereafter defending Beijing and going after Hong Kong 
protesters. Selling accounts is a common practice already mentioned in part three (→ p. 375). 
On the other hand, there were also “dormant” accounts: among the data published by 
Twitter, ASPI identified 233 accounts where there were intervals of  at least a year between 

A two tweets. Among them, the oldest had been created in December 2007.
C Their interest in Hong Kong intensified in May (one day before Carrie Lam suspended 
T
I the extradition bill) and June 2019 (with the “capture” of  the Legislative Council by the pro-
O testers).26 Even if  the tweets referencing Hong Kong were only a small part of  the sampled 
N data, the ASPI identified three main narratives: a rejection of  the protesters and the 
S condemnation of  their positions, support for the Hong Kong police and the “rule of  law,” 

and finally conspiracy theories suggesting “Westerners” were involved in the protests.
Hastily organized and lacking technical means, the ASPI describes a “blunt” influence 

operation. The method was similar to those used in mainland China, where censors often 
use spams to flood public opinion with certain types of  content, and to armies of  Weibo 
accounts paid to plaster official messages under certain types of  posts globally.27

C
A Chua Chin Hong, a Singapore-based specialist on Chinese media proposed a more gran-
S ulated analysis of  the second batch of  data published by Twitter (ten million tweets) that 
E refines our understanding of  the campaign. These tweets, posted between May and July 2019, 

represented a “campaign surge” which “could ironically be one of  the key reasons 
why the network set off  alarm bells at Twitter and got taken down.” During this surge,

the accounts disseminated 87,000 tweets and retweets (but only 27,000 original tweets). The D
U

overwhelming majority of  these messages were in Chinese with only 6% in English. 28 C

One indication of  the artificial nature of  these accounts was their lack of  experience T
I

using Twitter, which is banned in China. For instance, Chua highlighted that many of  the O
N

accounts unknowingly posted the welcome message on Twitter (“Just setting up my twitter 
#myfirstTweet”), before they started to successively retweet the “lead” accounts. For the 
Singaporean analyst, one of  the main clues to the “massive and coordinated” nature of  C
the disinformation campaign could be found in the accounts’ dates of  creation. Indeed, O
as the ASPI study showed, the accounts removed in August were rather old. In the September N
archive, the accounts were far more recent: out of  the 4,301 accounts listed more than half  C

E
(54%) were created during the previous three months. The largest spike in creation was P
on June 14 – one day before the extradition bill was suspended – but the analyst remained T
prudent and, in the absence of  proof  of  any coordination, spoke only of  a coincidence. S

2. Spam and dormant accounts

Another analyst, “AirMovingDevice,” underlines several other characteristics.29 First, the 
tweets were synchronized with Beijing’s time zone: the time slots during which the major- A
ity of  the tweets were published did not correspond to the local time zone (that is to say with C

T
the geographical zones advertised by Internet users) but to Beijing’s. Moreover, like the ASPI, O
AirMovingDevice highlighted long periods of  dormancy or non-activity in many R
accounts (nearly 41%). He described the following model: the accounts were created before S

2018, posted in different languages, and then remained inactive for more or less long periods of  
time. They were reactivated around 2018-2019 and started posting in Chinese.

The analyst gave the example of  披荆斩棘 (#saydullos1d), a female user presumably based 
in Colorado.30 This account, created in 2013, posted mainly in English on topics linked to hunt-
ing and fishing, without ever being retweeted or “liked.” She then progressively disappeared A
from the radars before reappearing in 2018. During these five years, she had “learned Chinese” C

T
and “developed a passion for butterflies,” for a few weeks at least. But this passion mysteriously I
evaporated to make room for Chinese tabloids. AirMovingDevice then showed that she spread O
content found on Weibo, even going as far as posting 1,000 messages in 2018. Then, in June N
2019, she suddenly started to retweet numerous messages condemning Hong Kong protesters. S

“Qujianming” was another example analyzed by Chua Chin Hong. Immediately suspect, 
Qujianming boasted 28,000 subscribers for 24,000 subscriptions, but, as Chua explained, it 
is rare for accounts to have that many subscriptions. Qujianming mainly tweeted in Chinese 
and called for “severe punishment for the violent protesters, systematically described as 
rioters (暴徒 – hooligans, thugs)” – who were accused of  following their own interests only 
(and not those of  Hong Kong). C

3. Case Study E

In a complementary approach to the essentially quantitative studies published by the ASPI in

D
U a. Methodology
C
T We chose to start with hashtags, that are a signature for the digital narra-
I
O tives and the narrative communities that conveyed them, to further investigate 
N some emblematic Twitter accounts. This approach has several advantages: first, a 

hashtag is often used and shared by large groups of  users at the same time, but it 
nonetheless remains defined and intelligible. In the case of  the Hong Kong protests, 

C each “side” defended its representations through clearly differentiated and divisive 
O
N hashtags. Sometimes the two sides fought over the same hashtags (#HongKongPolice 
C for instance), with one side defending the actions of  the Hong Kong riot police, and 
E the other condemning their violent actions. In other words, hashtags were a point of  
P convergence for the different sides and a structuring force for their discourses – a 
T
S shared signature of  some sort. As markers, they helped identify a group of  rela-

tively homogeneous users. This also allowed us to study the users’ discourse, 
which involved various channels (tweets, images, memes, allusions, wordplays, etc.). 
Finally, the hashtag is also a time marker, since it allows us to date its first use (and 
sometimes its decline). For all these reasons, our study analyzes of  a set of  hashtags 

A used in September and October 2019.
C Starting with these hashtags (listed below), we chose representative accounts based 
T on three criteria that questioned their authenticity: anonymous user IDs (a Twitter 
O
R user ID made of  a word, or part of  a word, with many numbers); a linguistic disso-
S nance (IDs using a “Western-sounding name” but tweeting only in Chinese); and their 

non-linearity or non-regularity (accounts that boasted more than 5,000 subscribers 
or subscriptions a few months after their creation, or accounts that had been inactive 
for a long time but suddenly starting to tweet in Chinese). 

These suspicious accounts were then analyzed in more details with the help of  open-
A source research tools (OSINT) such as “tinfoleaks” or “accountanalysis,” which gave us 
C the precise date of  an account’s creation, the date of  the first tweet, the hashtags used, 
T and so on. This method was relatively efficient: half  the accounts quoted in our investiga-
I tion have since been suspended (between the last weeks of  September and mid-October 
O
N 2019).
S The research on these accounts focused on the period that started on September 

20 and ended on October 20, 2019. The advanced research tools provided by Twitter 
made it possible to target certain phrases, enabling us to concentrate on the events 
that shaped this period: the protests of  September 28 and October 1, and those 
that followed the adoption of  the law outlawing masks during demonstrations. The 
choice of  this one-month period allows us to propose an analysis that takes into 

C account the evolution of  the methods and narratives used during this period, but 
A also to propose an original qualitative study that goes beyond a mere observation of  
S
E the virality of  the messages. We formulate hypotheses regarding the intentions and 

strategies that could have underlain their publication, thus complementing already 
existing studies. The analysis hopes to show the technical levers used with Twitter 
accounts and, therefore, their non-authentic or “unnatural” character (inherent to 
their irregular uses).

revolution (颜色革命) in Hong Kong. The photo showed a “calm, clean” Hong Kong 
that contrasted with the mass of  umbrellas. The message meant “let Hong Kong recover

collaboration with “exterior anti-Chinese forces.” Joshua Wong was accused of  wanting C

Cantonese and wrote “personal” tweets (which had very little to do with the Hong Kong 
protests). Furthermore, between April 8 and July 24, the account was barely active, with 
only three visible messages. The peak of  its activity occurred between September 21 and C
October 1 – not unlike @loverealface2 – which could mean there was a rapid campaign A
in the lead up to October 1. The content of  the tweets was similar to that of  @lovereal- S

• @TXT_Tathyunnn (last accessed on October 18, suspended on October 30) was a N

account (in Korean), pictures of  the singers, etc. Then, between April and October 7, 
2019, the account was completely inactive. In early October, the account posted a series

T sulted on October 14, but since suspended, was a particularly active account with almost 
I 1,100 tweets and 1,300 subscribers in its three months of  existence.33 On October 17, 
O however, another account @DllmhgCreal, created in July 2019 with the same profile 
N picture, and around 1,300 subscribers, resumed its activities.34 The content was very sim-
S

ilar to what was already presented: highlighting the protesters’ violence was its leitmotiv. 
They were often compared to terrorists. Each misdeed was scrutinized (or made up) and 
the messages recycled the specificities we have observed on WeChat: shocking images 
and titles that sought to prompt indignation, etc.

C c. “Relay accounts”
A
S In this study we also noted numerous accounts with a marginal audience, i.e. only a 
E few subscribers and subscriptions. These accounts seemed to simply retweet and share 

the content disseminated by the more important accounts presented above. We named 
these “relay accounts.”

There are many such fake accounts, but we could also find many “micro users” among 
them who try to go undetected by Twitter moderators. For example, “Wurufan” (务如凡

name seemed to have been randomly generated by computer. Not very active (123 D

tweets between its creation in July 2019 and October 10), the account had only five sub- C

followed the same principle. The account retweeted and commented on messages coming O

from bigger accounts (such as those quoted previously). The first tweets sent on September 
10 actually relayed messages from accounts which are now suspended.

Many accounts like this one took turns to generate content online. The account @ R
BeverleyMclare3, active on October 9, was suspended the next day; a similar account, S

@RuthannGant9, created in September 2019 (accessed on October 9 – 2 subscriptions, 
2 followers, 28 tweets), used the same codes; it subscribed to two other fake accounts @
anntaranti and @MaThao91, both created in September 2019, with one or no subscriber. 
If  they had been created in September, they apparently did not start tweeting until early 
October, which would indicate that they were back-up or secondary accounts. Both A
accounts were accessed on October 9 and suspended the next day. It is likely that these C

T
accounts are regularly suspended and then reprogrammed. A new example is provided by I
@UshaBoardman (account accessed on October 14, suspended on the 16th) created on O
September 23 and almost inactive until October 14. N

S
Another peculiarity is that most of  these “new” accounts used Western names. For 

instance, @GillianMonteith and @MarineMcgregor5 were two accounts that tweeted 
only in Mandarin about Hong Kong-related topics. These accounts were not the most influ-
ential because their audience was after all inexistent, but they revealed the Chinese strategy 
described in the ASPI reports or in other studies.

d. Anti-protester hashtags, narratives and iconographies A

The following texts were collected from hashtags used both in English and in Chinese. S
E

Generally, the tweets did not contain more than three or four keywords, among which we 
always found “Hong Kong” / “香港.” Here is an overview of  the main hashtags:

English.
This message appeared in late July

O sented before, but sponsored by 
N #全民撑警 The whole people support the police groups endorsing the Hong Kong 
S (and Chinese) government, and 

relayed by Guancha.a

a. “今天，香港全民撑警日” (“Today, it’s Hong Kong Police’s day”), 观察者网 (The Observer) (10 Aug. 2019). 
Variations on these hashtags did exist but it was neither pertinent nor possible to include all of  them here.  

The few hashtags listed above were among the most recurrent but they were not the only ones.

C
A These hashtags can be classified into two groups: those displaying patriotism or 
S
E nationalism (particularly among Diba members) and those which specifically covered 

protests in Hong Kong (either by supporting the police or disparaging the protesters).
To get a better understanding of  the anti-protester narratives disseminated on Twitter 

one need to study the content of  the tweets and images. The two main lines of  attack 
were the alleged violence of  protesters (drawing an analogy with terrorists, highlighting 

C the pillaging, accusations of  rape, of  lynching, etc.) and the alleged manipulations of  
O
N “foreign anti-Chinese forces.” Hereafter we show several tweets and infographics, both 
C in English and Chinese, which are representative of  these topics.

On image #1, the first strip shows protesters as cockroaches yelling “five demands and 
not one less” (the protesters’ slogan), “I want to break stuff, hit people and stop them from 

A
going back to work or to school.” On the strip at the bottom, under the red title (“Once C
the law prohibiting the wearing of  masks is enacted”), the “protester” on the right in the T
foreground says to his comrade: “Come on, you go first,” the other answers: “Errrrr ok, O
but I’m scared…” This image posted in late September 2019 was supposed to illustrate R

S
the fact that protesters only dared follow through with their actions because they 
felt protected by the anonymity provided by masks.

The main message was that masked protesters were violent, that they hid real weap-
onry (Image #2), and caused major damage (Image #3).

A particularly predominant leitmotiv advanced that protesters behaved more violently 
than the police. A number of  posters and messages highlighted the acts of  violence pre-
sumably committed by protesters against the police (Image #4). For example, Image 
#5, posted by Guancha, showed the following: “Neither peaceful nor reasonable,” followed 

C
by the caption “Peaceful? Reasonable? Certainly not!” Guancha was here trying to demone- O
tize the values exhibited by protesters (“we are peaceful and reasonable”) to better discredit N

C
them. L

Another angle was the “whataboutism,” a form of  sophistry which was about trying to 
create a diversion by invoking a different target. For example, in response to what was per-
ceived as the biased Western coverage of  the Hong Kong crisis, criticizing the violence of  

C the police and Beijing’s support, many influential Chinese-speaking accounts turned these 
A
S criticisms back against the West using comparisons – especially to the U.S. police, as we saw

D. The new corps of  volunteers on Weibo S

In mainland China, Weibo is the equivalent of  Twitter, and its content is strictly regu-
lated (→ p. 199), as with all the Chinese platforms. However, Weibo plays an essential role 
in the “fans’ economy.” Weibo is very lucrative for movie, reality TV, and music stars who 
have mastered mobilizing their communities.35 The race for popularity on this network has A
pushed many users to organize themselves in militant communities in order to support C
their idols or pay “water armies” (水军)36 to artificially increase the popularity of  a T
star (or product) on the network. Weibo is thus a permanent battlefield between different I

O
communities of  users defending their favorite celebrities.37 N

S
1. Diba

A well-known example among Chinese users is the group “Li Yi Ba” (李毅吧), which 
has morphed over time to become “Diba” (帝吧). “Liyiba” was originally a sub-section 
of  an online forum named “tieba,” a community of  users known for mocking a football 
player named Li Yi. It progressively became more organized and now regularly leads C
“campaigns” (出征 – as in “military campaigns”) against targets “outside the Great A
Chinese firewall” under the slogan “[when] Diba launches a military expedition not a blade S

E
of  grass is spared” (帝吧出征，寸草不生). For instance, Diba attacked the Facebook 
page of  the newly-elected head of  the Taiwanese government Tsai Ing-Wen38 and

S

On Twitter, the group Diba used the account @D8China. Thanks to Twint, we were 
able to collect all the published tweets before the account was deleted in late October or early 
November 2019. The first was posted in April 2019 and targeted activist groups defending 
the rights of  the Muslim Uyghur minority (and not Hong Kong demonstrators). The account 

A showed its successes through an article it shared.40 @D8China did not participate in targeted 
C campaigns but played the role of  a propagandist, highlighting Diba’s successes and relaying 
T
I Beijing’s watchwords: territorial unity, the fight against “biased Western media,” etc.
O On Facebook, Diba has several official groups (and pages). Foremost among these is 
N “Diba’s army group center” (帝吧中央集团军) created in 2015.41-42 In October 2019, it had 
S 83,000 members including 3,000 new members that subscribed during the previous 30 days. 

Diba also had several Facebook groups intended to organize its activities: “Diba’s campaign 
to protect Hong Kong” (帝吧出征守护香港),43 created in July 2019 with 8,000 members 
(October 2019), but also “Diba’s base of  operations,” created in April 2016 and which had 
22,000 members (October 2019).44 To join some of  these groups, administrators impose rules 
or submit users to questions which often consists in showing off  one’s patriotism.

C Diba was supposed to launch a campaign (出征) against Hong Kong protesters on 
A
S July 23, but it was brought forward to July 22 and the announcement was made on the

group’s Weibo account.45-46 The pages of  certain Hong Kong protesters’ support D

groups were targeted in a well-defined modus operandi: the attackers copied and pasted C

messages (often the same messages) one after another to saturate the spaces. However, T

this time Diba was quickly detected and its main operators “doxxed”: their names, O

addresses, telephone numbers and bank account details were made public and some of  
these were used for enrolment applications in the PLA. The main operation was apparently 
cancelled by the organizers for fear of  reprisals.47

2. Fanquan N
C

Another operation was apparently conducted between August 14 and 17, 2019 and this E
P

time by a set of  groups called “饭圈女孩” (fanquan nühai).48 Literally translated as T
the “girls of  the fan circle,” this was a group of  young Internet users (most often high S
school girls) deeply involved in the “pursuit of  stars” (追星– zhuixing).49 There were in fact 
different groups of  fans of  pop idols who “joined together” to help and support “阿中” 
(a-zhong) or 阿中哥哥 (a-zhong gege) – or, in other words, China.50 These fans developed a 
whole iconography based on “gifs” or memes (humoristic Internet images – biaoqing bao (表
情包 in Chinese)). And they responded to hashtags on Weibo such as “守护全世界最好的 A

C
阿中” (“Let us, in all corners of  the world, protect the greatest China!”).51 A search with this T
hashtag on Weibo returned a frenzy of  activities over the slightest subject that involved China, O
such as the NBA, Huawei, the military parade of  October 1 and, of  course, Hong Kong. R

Furthermore, the “fan girls” also have a Twitter account, @520CHINA666,52 created S

in June 2019 and suspended in late October. When we created our archive, around October 
25, the account had published nearly 3,700 tweets (we were able to collect around 1,000). 
In October, the fanquan boasted 5,000 subscribers and 55 subscriptions. In comparison to 
Diba’s account, this one was more aggressive insofar as it actually answered (often with 
insults) Internet users who favored democracy.53 A

3. Coordinated actions I
O

The peak in activity of  both Diba and Fanquan groups apparently occurred between August N
14 and 20. Chinese websites spoke of  the “814大团结” (“the Grand Unity of  August 14”): S
that day, different fan groups came together to lead a highly “disciplined” attack 
against China’s enemies. Diba and Fanquan groups apparently led the charge. This attack

49. In the West, the importance of  media consumerism and the fascination generated by pop-stars and other 
idols is seldom understood. This economy is also a very proactive social movement (with extremely organized online 
groups) that does not hesitate to use its striking force to support their artists or, like in this case, conduct campaigns 
against their adversaries.

O
N Another wave of  coordinated attacks reportedly took place on August 17.55 More than an 

“offensive campaign,” this “operation” aimed to stimulate patriotism and was supported by 
the pro-Beijing Hong Kong representative Junius Ho.56 The day before, Diba’s official Weibo 

C account issued a mobilization order. This message, “虽千万人吾往矣” (“even in the face of  
O ten million, I shall advance”), was a quote from the Confucian theorist Mencius. It accompa-
N nied instructions on how to “defend the right of  the Hong Kong police to arrest protesters” 
C
E (坚决支持香港警察依法拘捕暴徒). According to Guancha, who used screenshots as evi-
P dence, these groups were organized around QQ groups and into “regiments” (团). For 
T the occasion “reinforcement” groups from China (阿中后援团) were formed.
S In terms of  content the groups’ administrators provided the “ammunitions” (阿中

后援): images of  violent protesters, phrases and messages previously prepared in Chinese 
and English.

It is worth noting that the members of  these groups took up the 
codes of  Hong Kong protesters only to turn them against them. 

A

S of  order (恢复秩序), severe punishments for the rioters (严惩

暴徒), attack on lawlessness (打击违法), fair coverage of  the 
news (公正报道).
In parallel to this type of  targeted content, Diba’s Twitter group 

asked its subscribers to spread messages of  support on the Hong Police Facebook and 
Twitter groups.58 

A Of  course these actions encountered difficulties: Facebook and Twitter are banned in 
C

The scale of  the “attacks” on August 14-18 was such that the Weibo account of  T
S

the official TV network CCTC took up the information. Many articles, idols and popular 
Chinese social media accounts endorsed the initiative, calling on their members to spread 
images of  support.61 This wave of  patriotism also included Chinese students abroad.62 The 
organizers and articles dealing with this campaign asserted, while backing their claims with 
screenshots, that they were able “to take control” of  the comment sections of  several A
Facebook and Instagram pages belonging to Hong Kong media outlets or protest- C
ers.63 T

O
The Chinese also deployed their narratives through pornographic accounts on Twitter, R

Facebook and YouTube. The porn audiences of  these accounts were no doubt easier targets S
for Beijing’s pre-fabricated narratives, but also to skirt around the growing vigilance of  
traditional platforms in regard to Beijing’s activities.64 Rejected on certain platforms, 
Chinese intermediaries disseminating the Chinese narrative decided to use PornHub. This 
platform is not allowed in China, so Chinese agents acting from the mainland also had to 
use VPNs to “cross the wall.” One such account took the name “CCYL_central,”65 which A
seemed to be a reference to the Communist Youth League (→ p. 72), even if  there was C
probably no link between the operators and the CYL. As on the traditional platforms, pro- T
testers were compared to hooligans, or cockroaches, and the idea of  democracy itself  was I

discredited with references to its alleged deficiencies and malfunctions. N

Singapore has an ambivalent relationship with China, which mixes proximity and dis- P
trust, and several characteristics of  the country make it both vulnerable and uniquely resil- T

S
ient to Chinese influence.

I. Vulnerabilities
A

First, there are structural weaknesses such as its size. Singapore is a city-state that can C
T

be toured in one day with a bicycle and this affects everything: “here everything is strategic: O
there is no distinction between the tactical and the strategic.”66 This concentration, combined R
with the country’s hyper-connectivity, means that online fake news can reach the entire S

population within minutes. Besides, the widespread use of  both English and Chinese 
makes the Singaporean society easy to penetrate for foreign actors. Its dependence on imports 
for all essential goods and its tense relationship with Malaysia (which is itself  vulnerable 
to radical Islam and more or less aligned with Beijing) are other exploitable weaknesses. In 
fact, Beijing can use intermediaries based in Malaysia, for instance, to conduct disin- A
formation operations against Singapore that would seem all the more credible as Singapore C

T
and Malaysia have a tense relationship and because a number of  informational operations I
have already originated from Malaysia. Furthermore, there are precedents of  known Chinese O
groups paid to produce content in Malaysia, to target Taiwan especially (→ p. 367). N

Yet, the main vulnerability lies in the very nature of  Singapore’s multiethnic, cross-com- S

munity society. These attributes are both a source of  great richness and a lever easily acces-
sible to an ill-intentioned third-party actor. For now, cross-community tensions have been 
avoided, but this harmony is never guaranteed and it requires proactive policies (such as the 
constitutional revision that has allowed a Malaysian candidate to run for the presidency).67 A 
terrorist attack could easily trigger such tensions. Indeed, among the improbable but high-im-
pact scenarios that must not be overlooked is the possibility of  a terrorist attack targeting the C

A
Chinese, which could subsequently serve as a pretext for Beijing to intervene. S

Second, there are particular vulnerabilities in regard to China, primarily the pro- E
portion of  the population that is of  Chinese descent: according to official statistics, 3.01 of  
the 4.04 million inhabitants (74.5%) were Chinese in June 2020, 550,000 were Malaysian 

66. From an interview with one of  the authors, in Singapore (Nov. 2019). 
67. The constitutional amendment allows a presidential election to be reserved for candidates from a particular C

ethnic group if  that group has not been represented in the presidency in the last five terms. This applies to all ethnic O
N

groups: if  there were a series of  five non-”Chinese” presidents, the next election would be reserved for “Chinese” C
candidates. See in particular Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s speech, “Race, multiracialism and Singapore’s place in L
the world” (23 Sept. 2017). U

U (13.6%), 360,000, Indian (8.9%) and 130,000 classified as “others” (3.2%).68 This is why 
C Beijing’s main narrative describes Singapore as a “Chinese country” part of  the 
T
I “Greater China” that owes its loyalty to China. For this precise reason, and to avoid being 
O
N assimilated into China’s orbit, Singapore has always been wary in its dealings with China. 

For example, out of  the five earliest ASEAN members, Singapore was the last to establish 
diplomatic relations with China. However, the former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew (1959-

C 1990) contributed to the rapprochement by going to China frequently and by promoting, as 
O early as 1979, the use of  simplified characters in Singapore to align it with mainland China.
N The Chinese community is very organized, in clan associations for instance, a system 
C
E dating back to the early 19th century. More than 300 associations are officially registered in 
P Singapore. These serve as key institutions for “preserving a sense of  Chinese identity and 
T kinship.”69 They organize cultural events, trips to China, etc. Older generations, who generally 
S have a stronger affinity with China, are more likely to be members of  these associations.

Immigration from China keeps the proportion of  the Chinese population in Singapore 
at around 75%: their exact number is classified but there are an estimated 20,000 Chinese nat-
uralized in Singapore every year, and even more permanent residents. This flow contributes 
to maintaining a Chinese majority because the community has the lowest birth rate there 

A
C (7.6 per 1000 in 2019, compared to 8.7 for Indians and 14 for Malaysians70). Chinese new-
T comers, who retain their networks in mainland China, are an additional vector of  influence.
O For younger Singaporeans, who are less interested in clan associations, Chinese influence 
R
S is channeled mostly through its economic attractiveness. The youngest, born after the 

Tian’anmen generation, have a tendency to see China solely as an opportunity and not as a 
threat. The two economies are highly integrated: in the last two decades, Singapore has 
increased its exports to China while reducing the ones to the United States, Europe and Japan. 
Hence, the most powerful vector of  Chinese influence is neither clan-based nor cultural, 
but economic, with professional organizations, notably the Chinese Singapore Chamber of  

A Commerce and the Singapore Business Federation. “The PRC exerts leverage over Singapore 
C
T businessmen by making it harder for them to get contracts, licenses, permits, loans, etc – espe-
I cially in the real estate sector, where Singaporeans hold significant investments in China.”71 Those 
O doing business in China are in fact questioned by Chinese intelligence services, which extract 
N
S negative information that could damage the Singaporean government. They also give business-

men key elements of  speech that are printed on little cards and need to be disseminated by 
them.72 The Chamber of  Commerce and the Business Federation have also created the Chinese 
Development Assistance Council, which offers scholarships to study in China, among other 
actions. The Confucius Institute of  the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), inaugu-
rated in 2005 – one of  the first in the world (→ p. 300) – had only 200 students in 2006, but 

C 7,000 in 2020.
A Beijing can also count on media and individual relays. On the one hand, Xinhua has 
S a local office, China Daily has a supplement in the weekend edition of  The Straits Times and 
E there are local Chinese-speaking media, such as Lianbe Zaobao, a daily newspaper created 

in 1983 that has become the largest Chinese-speaking media in the city-state. On the other 
hand, certain influential and notoriously pro-Chinese voices regularly intervene in the pub-

lic debate, including Kishore Mahbubani. In July 2017, as dean of  the Lee Kuan Yew D
U

School of  Public Policy of  the National University of  Singapore, he published an op-ed in C

The Straits Times calling for Singapore, “a small State” which he compares to Qatar, to be T
I

more cautious in its relations with Beijing.73 O
N

Another, often under-estimated, vulnerability of  Singapore is its approach to human 
rights, since Beijing can prove a natural ally in the face of  the hegemony of  Western values 
that are presented as universal (i.e. the debate on Asian Values). C

In this context, Beijing’s objective “is to impose a Chinese identity on Singapore O
so that it will align more closely with the PRC’s expanding interests.”74 In concrete terms N
Beijing wants Singapore to stop training its armed forces in Taiwan (see the Terrex C

E
Affair below), to stop speaking of  the freedom of  navigation, and to further develop P
its trade with China. For example, Beijing wants a Chinese company to build the high- T
speed Singapore-Kuala Lumpur railway. Singapore refused, asking the Chinese to respond S
to the call for tenders like everyone else. Beijing responded by canceling a ministerial visit.

Consequently, the main narratives conveyed in Chinese operations targeting 
Singapore are the following: “Singapore is a country of  Chinese culture if  not altogether a 
Chinese country”; “it is a small country that can’t afford to be arrogant or make an enemy out 
of  the Chinese juggernaut”; “It is a country that has not had a strong leadership since Lee A

C
Kuan Yew (unlike his father, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong underestimates the importance T
of  the relationship with Beijing)”; “the country is too close to a declining United States, while O
China represents the future (it would be in Singapore’s interest to align itself  with Beijing)”; R

S
and “Singapore shouldn’t meddle in the debate on the South China Sea.”

II. The Terrex Affair: taking pledges
A

Since 1975, and for lack of  space at home, Singapore has trained its land army C
in southern Taiwan. Since the establishment of  diplomatic relations with China in 1990, T
Singapore has had a tacit agreement with Beijing which, while asking Singapore to use I

O
Hainan instead of  Taiwan, never turned the issue into a problem because Singapore kept N
a low profile (notably by making their military wear Taiwanese uniforms when they are S
there75) and respected the One-China policy.76 However, on November 23, 2016, Hong 
Kong customs seized nine military Terrex armored vehicles belonging to Singapore 
that were transiting in a commercial carrier to Singapore from Taiwan, where they had 
taken part in military exercises. The transit was routine: Singapore has been transiting its 
military vehicles, on the way back from exercises in Taiwan, through Hong Kong since the 
1990s and it had never been a problem. Furthermore, this military equipment benefits from C
an immunity and cannot legally be confiscated or withheld by the authorities of  another A

S
state.77 This did not prevent Beijing, via Hong Kong, from doing so. E

The spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs reminded Singapore that 
states which have diplomatic relations with China must abstain from “[having] any form of

U official exchanges with Taiwan, including military exchanges and cooperation.”78 Chinese 
C media, particularly the Global Times, took over after the ministry. They exhorted Singapore 
T
I to abandon its military training in Taiwan – unless it wanted to see its relationship with 
O
N China deteriorate. The affair generated tensions between China and Singapore until the 

eventual restitution of  the vehicles on January 30, 2017. In this interval, a disinformation 
campaign hit Singapore using dormant accounts (inactive for a long time before they 

C were suddenly awakened), according to a Singaporean social media analyst.79

O Truly, this was not an isolated case or a random occurrence: Hong Kong customs 
N officers seized the containers carrying the Terrex vehicles at a moment when Beijing was 
C
E ostensibly looking for a way to heighten the pressure on Singapore. The relationship 
P had been deteriorating for almost a year.80 In December 2015, a strengthened cooperation 
T defense agreement between the U.S. and Singapore, which notably involved the deploy-
S ment of  US Navy P-8A Poseidon military airplanes in Singapore, was not well-received by 

Beijing. In June 2016, the absence of  the Singaporean Minister of  Foreign Affairs Vivian 
Balakrishnan at a joint ASEAN-China press conference in Kunming was also noted. In 
September, the Global Times accused Singapore of  having tried to raise the issue of  freedom 
of  navigation in the South China Sea and The Hague’s verdict on the matter at a summit of  

A
C the Non-Aligned Movement in Venezuela. The attempt, according to the Party’s newspa-
T per, was immediately blocked by many countries.81 The Singaporean ambassador to China, 
O Stanley Loh, protested against this “fabricated” information. Responding to the ambassa-
R
S dor, Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief  of  the Global Times, attacked Singapore for siding with 

the Philippines and Vietnam on the conflictyal South China Sea, and accused the country 
of  hosting U.S. warplanes “aimed at China.”82 On October 1, General Jin Yinan (金一南) 
of  the PLA National Defense University went further, declaring on Chinese national radio 
(CNR) that Singapore had been meddling for years in affairs which are none of  its concerns 
(the South China Sea) and advising Washington on the subject. He believed that “[it was] 

A inevitable for China to strike back at Singapore, and not just on the public opinion 
C
T front… Since Singapore has gone thus far, we have got to do something, be it retaliation 
I or sanction.”83

O The Terrex affair thus crowned a series of  incidents in a tense bilateral relation. 
N
S This sequence itself  was not coincidental: its climax, the Terrex affair, came exactly one 

year before Singapore’s chairmanship of  the ASEAN (November 2017), and coincided 
with Singapore’s coordination of  the ASEAN-China Dialogue (2015-2018). From 
Beijing’s point of  view it was necessary to remind the city-state about “who was in charge,” 
particularly on the topic of  freedom of  navigation, and especially after Singapore had called 
for the implementation of  The Hague’s decision rendered in July 2016. During this period 

C Singaporeans were bombarded with YouTube videos in Mandarin and clan associ-
A ations subjected to particularly intense pressure, always with the same narrative: 
S Singapore “must stay in its place” as a “Chinese country” which must not rely on 
E the United States; besides, the ASEAN was presented as worthless without China.84

III. The cases of  Huang Jing and Jun Wei “Dickson” Yeo O
R
S

In the past few years, two cases of  Chinese espionage in Singaporean academic circles 
have received media attention. The first concerns Huang Jing (黄靖). Born in China in 1956, 
educated in both China (masters at Fudan University) and the United States (PhD at Harvard), 
he is an American citizen who lived and worked for twenty years in the United States, occupying 
different positions in universities and research centers, including Stanford and the Brookings A
Institution, before joining the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew School of  Public Policy at the National C
University of  Singapore, serving as director for the Center on Asia and Globalization as well as T
the Lee Foundation Professor on US-China Relations. In parallel, Huang was an analyst for the I

O
Chinese press agency Xinhua. In August 2017, he was accused by the Singaporean Ministry of  N
the Interior of  being “an agent of  influence for a foreign state” that was not identified; he and S
his wife were expelled from the country (with their residency permits revoked). They went to 
China where, since 2019, Huang Jing has been the dean of  the Institute for International and 
Regional Studies at the Beijing Language and Culture University.

The second case is less ambiguous: it was tried in U.S. courts.86 It involved Jun Wei 
“Dickson” Yeo (杨俊伟), born in Singapore in 1981. He may also have been linked to the 
previous case as he was one of  Huang’s PhD students at the Lee Kuan Yew School of  Public C
Policy. This link led Bilahari Kausikan, an ex-diplomat and a major figure in the Singaporean A

S
foreign policy debate, to declare that it was Huang Jing who had Yeo recruited by Chinese E
intelligence services, something Huang denied.87 Yeo was recruited by Chinese intelli-

Beauchamp-Mustafaga, Jeffrey W. Hornung, Chinese Disinformation Efforts on Social Media, RAND Corporation, 2021, p. 
82. For the authors, the fact that these videos were published exclusively in Chinese (simplified and traditional) suggests 
that they were specifically targeted at Singaporean clan associations.

U gence in 2015 through Chinese think tanks which invited and paid Yeo to write reports. 
C He quickly came to understand that these “scholars” were in fact intelligence officers. He 
T
I was debriefed during frequent trips to China and online via WeChat. Initially used to transmit 
O
N information about South-East Asia, he was reoriented toward the United States, where he had 

previously studied, he subsequently lived in DC for several months in 2019. His mission was 
to collect information and to recruit U.S. sources, which he did through LinkedIn and by 

C creating a fake consultancy agency that put out job offers in order to collect CVs.
O In this way he came into contact with U.S. military member and officials with access to 
N confidential information. He would ask them to write reports in exchange for money.88 A 
C
E U.S. Army officer working at the Pentagon was hence hired to write a report, allegedly for 
P private Asian clients, on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and its consequences for 
T China. This work was paid $2,000, which was wired to the officer’s wife’s account to avoid 
S raising suspicion. An agent from the State Department also became entrapped by writing a 

report about a member of  the U.S. Cabinet. Yeo’s Chinese handlers asked him to go further 
by trying to recruit the U.S. officer so that he could transmit different, more confidential, 
information this time. But Yeo was arrested when he landed in the U.S. in November 2019, 
precisely to do that. He pleaded guilty of  espionage during his trial and was sentenced to 14 

A
C months in jail. After serving his sentence, he went back to Singapore, where he was arrested 
T by the Internal Security Department on the day of  his arrival (December 30, 2020).89

IV. Resilience
Chinese influence is not a new problem for Singapore, which had defended itself  from 

it during the 1950s and 1960s “when People’s Republic of  China (PRC) leaders sought to 
A export communist revolution to Southeast Asia.”90 Singapore has always been able to offer a 
C nimble resistance. Its defense rests on the development of  a counter-narrative where a 
T unique national identity, one that is multicultural and multi-racial, “is closely managed 
I
O as an existential issue by Singapore’s ruling elites.”91 It defends the singular identity of  Chinese 
N Singaporeans compared to other Chinese identities in the world and, of  course, to the way 
S Beijing views this identity. For instance, to counter – or at least to compensate for – the cre-

ation in 2012 of  the Chinese Cultural Center, the Singaporean government created its own 
“Singapore” Chinese cultural center in 2017. It promotes the idea of  “a vibrant Singapore 
Chinese culture, rooted in a cohesive, multi-racial society,” and during his speech at the cen-
ter’s inauguration Prime Minister Lee Hsien Long emphasized that “Chinese in Singapore are 
very different from the Chinese in China, in terms of  both history and identity.”92

C If  three quarters of  the population are theoretically “Chinese,” the vast majority 
A
S of  them feel Singaporean, speak English (many only speak very imperfect Mandarin), 
E have a largely Western, Asian and non-Chinese culture (Taiwanese and Korean singers are 

far more popular in Singapore than Chinese singers). In spite of  Beijing’s efforts there 
is very little cultural penetration. Chinese influence on Chinese-speaking media is rela-

tively limited because of  the already tight control Singapore exerts on all outlets. Ultimately D
U

money and business ties remain the main vulnerabilities. C

Moreover, in recent years, people have grown cognizant to the risks posed by T
I

Chinese influence in Singapore, in the course of  several episodes: the Terrex Affair in O
N

2016, the Huang Jing Affair in 2017, the departure the same year of  Mahbubani, whose 
op-ed on the “small state” generated controversy, and also the hack on the Ministry of  
Health (between June 27 and July 4, 2018). 1.5 million patients’ medical files were stolen, C
among which were that of  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who was “specifically and O
repeatedly targeted.”93 The attack was never attributed but, according to some sources, the N
incident may have been a response to the Huang espionage affair to find compromising C

E
information on the Prime Minister and blackmail him, or simply to undermine him. The P
attackers found nothing however. T

Meanwhile, Bilahari Kausikan, a former ambassador and permanent secretary of  the S
Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, published several articles in The Straits Times in June and July 
2018. In these, he called on Singaporeans to “be aware” when Beijing is trying to manipulate 
them and not to “trust oversimplified narratives.”94 He wrote that “China uses a range 
of  tactics – from legitimate diplomacy to more covert and often illegal deployment 
of  agents of  influence and operations – to sway decision makers or public opinion A

C
leaders.”95 He believes that these operations against Singapore were intended “not T
just to direct behavior, but to condition behavior. China does not just want you to O
comply with its wishes, it wants you to… do what it wants without being told.”96 R

S
He also noted that “[o]ur identity, based in the idea of  multiculturalism and meritocracy, 
is under pressure. There are centrifugal forces trying to pull us apart”, and went on to cite 
China’s attempts to “assert the Chinese identity on multiracial Singapore.”97 These interven-
tions inspired others afterward.98

A year later Russell Hsiao published an often-mentioned report on Chinese influ-
ence operations in Singapore.99 China reacted through its embassy, dismissing the claims A
as “absurd.” But the report was benefitial as it liberated the discussion on the subject in C

T
Singapore: the topic remains touchy but it is well-documented and, with the accumulation I
of  scandals since 2016, which are frequently analyzed in more and more details, the subject O
has become unavoidable and easier to talk about. N

S
Finally, the Singaporean government is acutely aware of  its vulnerabilities, partic-

ularly in regard to national unity, and regularly takes measures against what a 2013 report 
called “corrosive speech.”100 Unlike hate speech, it targets certain communities, and can 
easily be instrumentalized, possibly by a third state, to create inter-community tensions. 
For example, the Internet website TheRealSingapore.com was shut down in May 2015 by 
the Media Regulation Authority (MDA) because some articles threatened public order and C

Why is China interested in Sweden? Generally, China takes an interest in all Nordic P
countries, that is to say Denmark (with the Faeroe Islands and Greenland), Finland, T

S
Norway, Iceland and Sweden, to which China has been proposing for several years, in 
vain for now, to meet in a “5+1” format modeled on the “17+1” group with states from 
Central and Eastern Europe (→ p. 310). China considers these countries to be a double 
entryway, toward the Arctic first (Sweden has hosted a Chinese satellite station in its far 
northern reaches since 2006 – this is China’s first fully-owned station1), and then toward A
the EU, because it has a longstanding relationship with these countries (Sweden, Denmark C
and Finland, in that order, were among the first Western countries to establish diplomatic T
relations with the PRC in 1950) and because they “are politically stable, pro-free trade and, O

They have the advantage of  offering both a regulatory environment that is not 
very restrictive, even permissive, for foreign investment, and leading technology 
sectors, with some of  the world’s most innovative companies. And this combination is 
valuable. As Heather Conley and James Lewis showed, “China remains dependent on C

forced technology transfers as a prerequisite to conducting business in China; (2) S

U cyber espionage; and (4) the acquisition of  foreign firms.”4 In Nordic countries 
C China mostly uses economic espionage, as it does elsewhere – except in local universities 
T
I (China lacks the critical number of  Chinese students it has in Australia or Canada for 
O
N example), but also the acquisition of  local businesses, as a privileged way of  accessing 

technologies.
If  “the primary motive for Chinese investment in the Nordics is commercial,” 

C strategic interests are never far behind: it can be illustrated by investments in “semi-
O conductors and munitions-related technology as well as emerging technology such 
N as FinTech, GreenTech, BioTech and MaritimeTech.”5 The acquisitions of  Awilco in 
C
E Norway (2008), which produces drilling equipment among other things, of  Volvo Cars 
P in Sweden (2010) and of  Elkem, dealing with the production of  silicon, silicone and 
T carbon materials, in Norway (2011). They still rank among China’s most important 
S purchases in Europe.

In this region, Sweden has generated the greatest Chinese interest because it is par-
ticularly innovative and has a strong start-up culture. “Sweden is China’s Nordic Hub6” 
and it attracted the highest levels of  Chinese investment in Europe ($3.6 billion) in 2018, 
far ahead of  other countries ($1.6 billion in the United Kingdom, 1.5 in Germany and 1.4 

A
C in France).7 When the Chinese Geely purchased Volvo Cars in 2010 and Volvo AB (which 
T makes trucks and buses) in 2018 – one of  the most important Chinese acquisitions in 
O Europe and North America – it made an impression in Sweden and internationally. A peak 
R
S in acquisitions was reached in 2017 (51 majority and 40 minority holdings). In 2018, 

China had a majority stake in 114 companies.8 And, in November 2019, more than 1,000 
companies declared that they were, in effect, owned by a Chinese or Hong Kong citizen – 
and yet, the real scope of  these acquisitions is certainly greater than what can actually be 
measured.9

Beijing has taken a notable interest in firms that develop dual-use technologies, 
A i.e. for both civilian and military uses. For instance, Chinese companies have purchased 
C
T three Swedish semiconductor businesses, including Silex Microsystems (by a company with 
I ties to the Chinese defense sector), and Chematur, a spin-off  of  the ammunition manu-
O facturer Nobel which stands at “the center of  Sweden’s defense industrial base”10 (by the 
N
S Wanhua group). The government’s China strategy, presented in September 2019, confirms 

that CCP intelligence activities in Sweden are not only significant but also focused 
on acquiring military technologies, in addition to intelligence on Swedish military capa-
bilities. It also mentioned that the Chinese satellite station in northern Sweden could also 
be used for military intelligence.11

I. A typical case of  a “Machiavellian moment” D
U
C
T

For a long time, China invested a good deal in its relationship with Sweden and the I
O

Swedish public opinion was rather favorable, since China meant new jobs. But then the N

Party entered in a “Machiavellian moment” with the appointment of  a new ambas-
sador in August 2017: Gui Congyou (桂从友), apparently tasked with dominating the 
public debate. He quickly showed himself  to be aggressive (some observors acknowledged C
a turning point in early 2018), attacking the media, journalists, the government, political O
parties, scholars, and denying visas with the aim of  enticing fear and self-censorship. N

C
The ambassador’s profile is revealing: Gui Gonyou admitted that he did not know any- E

thing about Sweden when he was appointed, that he had never visited the country, and that P
he had never had a Swedish friend.12 He even declared in February 2020 that “he did not T

S
know why he had been sent to Sweden.”13 However, he speaks very good Russian and he 
is an expert on Russia: the earlier part of  his career alternated between Moscow, where he 
was posted twice and he remained for about 10 years, and Beijing, where he kept a close eye 
on Russian affairs for the ministry, often accompanying Xi Jinping during his diplomatic 
visits to countries in the former USSR. He was one of  the main instigators of  the Xi-Putin A
summits and he attended at all high-level meetings between Chinese and Russian leaders. C

In Stockholm, the ambassador multiplied attacks and threatening statements, T
especially against the media. He even talked of  “the tyranny of  the media.”14 On tele- O

R
vision he likened Swedish media criticizing China to a “48-kilogram lightweight boxer who S
starts a fight with an 86-kilogram heavyweight boxer, who out of  kindness and good-
will urges the (smaller) boxer to take care of  himself.” This provoked a reaction from 
the Swedish Minister of  Foreign Affairs, who interpreted the ambassador’s words as an 
“unacceptable threat” and an attempt to intimidate, and incidentally to muzzle, the press.15 
The embassy also publishes a lot on its own site: during 2019, it published at least 74 neg- A
ative comments on Swedish media, most of  them in reaction to publications perceived to C
express criticism of  China.16 Gui Congyou maintains constant pressure on the media, T
inviting some journalists to lunch to comment on how they cover China, sending protest I
emails himself  when he doesn’t like an article. O

N
These practices were documented and analyzed by journalist Patrik Oksanen, head S

of  the Center for Influence and Disinformation Analysis at the think tank Frivärld, in a 
September 2020 study titled China’s attacks to silence critics.17 When conducted a follow-up 
analysis a year later, he found that the embassy’s tactics had changed. In an August 2021 
report entitled The Dragon’s Changing Tactics, he noted that the frequency of  public statements 
on the embassy’s website appeared to have decreased, with the emphasis shifting to direct, 
intimidating and even threatening letters to journalists, experts and MPs.18 Already, C
in a survey made public in January 2020, at least four of  Sweden’s largest media groups A
(Svenska Dagbladet, Expressen, Sveriges Radio and Sveriges Television) said they had been S

U contacted and criticized repeatedly by the Chinese embassy – some of  the language used, 
C in letters and emails, was threatening.19 And, in April 2021, Jojje Olsson, a Swedish jour-
T
I nalist based in Taiwan who has long been a target of  the Chinese authorities, received yet 
O
N another email from the Chinese embassy, clearly threatening him: “we ask you to stop your 

wrongful actions immediately, otherwise you will end up facing the consequences of  your 
actions.”20 In order to denounce and counter this practice, the think tank Frivärld launched 

C a campaign on social networks, calling on the recipients of  these messages to testify using 
O the hashtag #Kinabrev.
N This behavior is not exclusive to the embassy: Swedish journalists we met said that 
C
E they were victims of  intimidation tactics from Chinese diplomats but also from various 
P Chinese associations, including student associations, which demanded that the journalists 
T stop writing about specific topics. Some journalists were even followed by car to their 
S homes.21

This pressure goes far beyond the media: for instance, the embassy convinced the 
Sheraton Stockholm hotel to cancel the celebration of  the Taiwanese national holiday in 
October 2019, even though it had hosted the event for more than a decade. The celebration 
was finally hosted by the Swedish History Museum, which resisted the embassy’s pressure.22

A
C China’s aggressive turn in Sweden has been consequential since 2018: the Sino-
T Swedish relationship has considerably deteriorated. The Chinese ambassador has been 
O summoned by the Swedish Ministry of  Foreign Affairs nearly forty times since he was 
R
S appointed. In late 2019, several MPs demanded his expulsion. Then again in 2021 after 

the journalist Jojje Olsson was threatened by the Chinese embassy: several Swedish pol-
iticians then again called for the expulsion of  the ambassador.23 Sweden was also the 
first European country to close all its Confucius Institutes (the last in December 2019 
and the last Classroom in April 2020).24 Sweden eventually rewrote its “China strategy,” 
which was presented to the national parliament in September 2019, and it created a cen-

A ter for China Studies (along with another privately-funded institution) to better anticipate 
C
T challenges posed by China’s growing influence. Even the city of  Gothenburg, the second 
I largest in the country, home to Volvo, and where China is omnipresent (to the extent that 
O restaurant and service personnel are trained to speak Chinese), has cancelled its twin 
N
S city program with Shanghai in April 2020 – a 34-year-old partnership. In October 2020, 

the Swedish Post and Telecommunications Authority (PTS) banned equipment from 
Chinese companies (Huawei, ZTE) in its ongoing call for tenders on the 5G infrastruc-
ture (a decision confirmed in January 2021 by the Administrative Court in Stockholm, 
which rejected Huawei’s appeal). The government is increasingly distrustful of  China, once 
seen only as an economic boon, but now perceived as a national security threat. China’s 

C public approval plummeted with 49% of  unfavorable opinion in 2017, 52% in 2018, 70% 
A in 2019, 85% in 2020, and 80% in 2021. Nowadays, out of  the 34 countries surveyed, only 
S the Japanese hold more negative opinions on China than the Swedes (→ p. 191).25 From

mat, the Nordics are considering organizing themselves against Chinese influence in a “5 D
U

against 1” format. C

In September 2021, the Chinese embassy in Stockholm finally announced the departure T
I

of  Ambassador Gui Congyou, who was recalled to Beijing. This announcement was wel- O
N

comed in Sweden with a certain relief  (expressed on social networks by journalists, research-
ers and political leaders26), but without naivety as to his successor who could follow in his 
footsteps if  Beijing wishes. His record is objectively disastrous. Since the end of  2017, he C
has unpicked the relationship his predecessors had built. “By launching a combative campaign O
ill-adapted to local conditions, China appears to have shot itself  in the foot.”27 How can it N
be explained? First, as Jerdén and Bohman showed, his priority was not to seduce the C

E
Swedes but the CCP: “[his] actions may [have been] motivated by a desire to impress supe- P
riors in Beijing. By vocally propagating China’s narrative abroad, he [put] his embassy in the T
spotlight and positioned it as a front runner in Xi Jinping’s mission to increase China’s global S
influence over media and ‘tell China’s story well.’”28 This is an overall feature of  the phenom-
enon of  “wolf  warrior” diplomats – which we presented in the third part (→ p. 222). Gui 
Gonyou was one of  its precursors. Then, the ambassador’s lack of  understanding of  lib-
eral democracies – his experience abroad being exclusively Russian – very likely contributed 
to his haphazardeous crisis management and in underestimating the negative consequences A

C
of  an overly aggressive behavior in Sweden for China. The embassy should have foreseen that T
Sweden, being one of  the most hostile countries toward the CCP and toward authoritarianism O
in general, was also likely to resist this pressure. R

S
Beyond the personality of  the ambassador, Sweden is debating whether the country 

was chosen as a testing ground for a more aggressive strategy that China could ulti-
mately generalize globally. Why Sweden? There are several reasons:

• Sweden is the right size: small enough not to be a threat, with no diaspora-related 
issues (there were only 31,700 people of  Chinese origin in Sweden in 2017, 10,000 more 
than in 2009, and 2,671 students),29 but large enough to be significant, in any case for A

C
Europe. T
• Sweden is a world champion of  democratic and liberal values, one of  the leaders I

O
in terms of  “soft power diplomacy.”30 The country always tops rankings (thus the cul- N
tural shock experienced by the Chinese ambassador when he arrived in a country sys- S
tematically in the top five of  RSF’s Freedom of  the Press rankings, whereas China is in 
the bottom five or three out of  180 countries). Sweden is then a symbol, a model to 
be broken (with the idea that if  China achieves this, the foundations of  all democracies 
can be shaken at their core).
• Linked to this, this is also a state that is among the most vehement critics of  human 

C
rights violations in China. From this point of  view, going after Sweden was an opportu- A
nity to demonstrate that criticizing China comes at a cost. This is a message for the S
world and especially for Europeans. E

ist, who was kidnapped and incarcerated for 23 days in China in 2016, and was forced 

C to confess on television.31 The “hostage diplomacy” practiced by China has left traces 
O
N in Sweden. There was also the Qiao Jianjun (乔建军) affair, which involved a former 
C civil servant who became one of  China’s most wanted fugitives, allegedly for corruption 
E (he was accused of  misappropriating millions of  dollars). He was arrested in Sweden at 
P Beijing’s request in August 2018, but Stockholm refused to extradite him (the Swedish 
T
S Supreme Court held that this would be a violation of  the European Convention on 

Human Rights, since he would risk death, torture and/or other inhuman or degrading 
treatment). He was freed in June 2019 and re-arrested five days later at the request of  the 
United States, which was also looking for Qiao. He was extradited to the United States 
in late May 2020. 

A • Finally, Sweden – which hosted the Dalai Lama in September 2018 – has granted asy-
C
T lum to Uyghur, Tibetan and Falun Gong refugees, i.e. Beijing’s main targets. This 
O was confirmed by a series of  spying cases in these communities: in 2010, a Uyghur 
R refugee was condemned to 16 months in prison on charges of  spying for China (he had 
S infiltrated the Uyghur World Congress and provided information to a Chinese intelli-

gence officer posing as a diplomat)32; in 2018 a Tibetan refugee was also condemned to 
22 months in jail on charges of  espionage in the service of  China (he had infiltrated the 
Swedish Tibetan community and was transmitting information to a Chinese intelligence 
officer in Poland).33

A For Beijing the objective is to make Sweden submit by limiting its freedom of  expres-
C
T sion, notably on the “five poisons” while sending a warning shot at other countries, 
I especially in Europe. But this has completely failed: instead of  giving in, Sweden has 
O resisted and the consequence has simply been the deterioration of  bilateral relations and of  
N China’s image in Sweden.
S In any case, the Swedish case is both an opportunistic test and a symptom of  a 

worldwide evolution in the behavior of  China: the same happened in Canada (→ p. 537), 
Australia, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Among them, there are differences of  inten-
sity but not of  nature. The Swedish case is particularly spectacular because of  preexisting 
tensions in the bilateral relations, but this announces a larger turning point and was inter-
preted as such, even in 2018.34

C  We call this turning point the Chinese “Machiavellian 
A moment” (→ p. 619).

The Gui Minhai Affair T
I

Gui Minhai is a writer, editor and librarian who, born in China, arrived in Sweden in 1988 to O
begin a Ph.D and who stayed there, acquiring the Swedish citizenship while renouncing his N

Chinese citizenship. He then settled in Hong Kong, creating several publishing houses from 
2006 on. Under a pseudonym (Ah Hai), he published a number of  works on China’s political 
life that were banned in mainland China. Knowing himself  to be watched and under threat, he 
avoided going back to China, missing his father’s last days of  life and funeral as a result. C
In October 2015, he was abducted by Chinese intelligence officers during his hol- O
iday in Thailand and disappeared. Four of  his colleagues also subsequently disappeared. N
Confirmation of  his incarceration came in January 2016 in a quintessential Soviet-style C
televised confession – a practice that has made a comeback in China in recent years35 E
(in July 2020, Britain’s Ofcom estimated that CGTN had violated the broadcasting rules of  the P
United Kingdom by showing the forced confession of  a British citizen).36 In a CCTV broad- T
cast, Gui, in tears, “confessed” to having killed a young woman in a car accident in 2003 and S
explained that, full of  remorse, he had surrendered to the Chinese authorities. He added: “I do 
not want any individual or organization, including Sweden, to involve themselves in, or inter-
fere with, my return to China. Although I have Swedish citizenship, I truly feel that I am still 
Chinese – my roots are in China. So I hope Sweden can respect my personal choice, respect 
my rights and the privacy of  my personal choice.”37

In October 2017, Chinese authorities informed Sweden of  Gui Minhai’s release. He, however, A
had not provided any news, which left the exact situation unclear. What we do know is that C
in January 2018, while in the company of  two Swedish diplomats on a train headed for T
Beijing for medical examinations, Gui was once again abducted by ten men dressed as O
civilians. He reappeared in another televised confession, in which he admitted to having been R
pressured by the Swedish authorities into trying to leave China, using a medical appointment S
at the Swedish embassy as a pretext.
In November 2019, he received the Tucholsky Prize for Freedom of  Expression from the 
Swedish section of  PEN, which angered the Chinese embassy. In February 2020 he was finally 
sentenced to ten years in prison on charges of  espionage – a new accusation that came 
as a surprise as it had never been raised before. On this occasion, it was revealed that in 2018 
Gui Minhai had “demanded” to recover his Chinese citizenship (which was largely seen as a 
maneuver to deprive him of  his consular visitation rights). However, Sweden still considers A
Gui as one of  its citizens since, as far as Sweden is concerned, there has been no proper and C
formal renunciation of  Swedish citizenship. T

C
T (2018)
I
O
N This affair took place in September 2018, in two stages. First some Chinese tourists claimed 

they had been abused by the Swedish police, the embassy became involved and the affair was 
largely covered by Chinese media. Second, a Swedish satirical program mentioned the events 

C and its take on them generated a violent reaction. Before examining these two phases in detail, 
O
N we should note that the timing of  the affair was suspicious, because very opportune, coming 
C at a moment when the Chinese embassy in Sweden was on the defensive.
E
P
T A. Prologue
S

This affair took place in a context of  tensions that had been escalating after early June 
2018, following the simultaneous publication, in 38 Swedish newspapers, of  a call for the release 
of  Gui Minhai signed by 45 intellectuals and public figures.38 The embassy immediately reacted 

A by sending emails, letters and texts, and by calling the signatories; more than two thirds of  them 
C confirmed that they received a lengthy file from Chinese authorities incriminating Gui Minhai. Jojje 
T Olsson and other Swedish journalists subsequently demonstrated that these files were fabricated.39 
O The very aggressive embassy multiplied its often ad hominem attacks against the signatories and 
R
S the media which published the call to release Gui Minhai. This offensive was counter-productive 

insofar as it drew negative attention and “raised interest and awareness not only about the Gui 
Minhai case, but Chinese influence on Swedish society in general.”40 In late June protests took 
place in front of  the embassy. In late August, Gui Minhai was formally invited to the Gothenburg 
Book Fair: the invitation was published in the press and sent to the Chinese embassy.

Björn Jerdén and Viking Bohmans’ quantitative study, which counted the number of  crit-
A
C ical statements released by the Chinese embassy,41 confirmed their marked increase since 
T early June 2018. The authors also showed that most of  the embassy’s statements pertained 
I either to Gui Minhai or to human rights in China (notably Xinjiang or organ trafficking).

This timeline shows that the affair that occurred in September 2018, which we pres-
ent in the following pages, occurred precisely when the embassy was on the back 
foot and it constituted a riposte to criticism of  human rights violations in China. In other 
words, it allowed Chinese authorities to create a diversion and turn the accusation 
around in a piece of  hypocritical sophistry (tu quoque) that let Beijing attack Sweden A
for violating the rights of  Chinese tourists on its own soil. This coincidence corroborates C

T
our hypothesis that this affair was, at the very least, a blatant instance of  Chinese O
instrumentalization of  an incident, and it may even have been an entirely fabricated R
incident designed to manipulate public opinion. S

B. Chinese tourists allegedly abused by the Swedish police

On September 1, shortly before midnight, the Zengs (曾), a family of  three, arrived at A
the Generator Hostel in Stockholm nearly fifteen hours in advance, their reservation having C
been booked for the afternoon of  the following day. They demanded to sleep in the hall T
which the hotel refused.42 The family settled down on the sofas and refused to leave. I

Hours later, judging their behavior as threatening, O
N

the staff  called the police, which removed the family. S
Whereupon a theatrical scene ensued, with several 
cameras rolling: the father, suddenly unable to walk 
had to be carried out of  the hotel by the police while 
the son screamed in English: “This is killing! This is 
killing!” The mother, seated on the ground, began 
crying and screaming in Chinese: “Save our lives.” C

To add to this comedy, without anyone having touched him, the son hurled himself  on the A
ground crying, as if  he had been pushed.43 S

weeks before publicly reacting on its internet website. On September 14, it released a warning in D
U

Chinese to all nationals visiting the country and informing them that Chinese people in Sweden C

had recently been “harshly treated by the Swedish authorities.”47 The next day, the embassy T
I

posted a message of  indignation “strongly condemning the behavior of  the Swedish police,” O
N

announcing that official protests had been sent to the Swedish government in Stockholm and 
its embassy in Beijing, and demanding a public apology, that the police officers involved be pun-
ished, and for a financial comensation for the family of  tourists.48 Two days later, the embassy C
posted an interview in English and Chinese.49 In it the ambassador repeated the family’s version O
of  events, according to which they had arrived only “a few hours” early (in reality, fifteen hours N
early), been “treated brutally” (there is no proof  of  this and even a testimony to the contrary), C

E
and thrown “into a cemetery” (this was in fact the name of  a subway station), etc. Most notably, P
he used the incident to address the larger security situation in Sweden and how he, before T
arriving, had thought of  Sweden as a safe place where it wasn’t even necessary to lock one’s S
door, and how one year in the country had destroyed this illusion. He finally stated that, on aver-
age, two Chinese tourists in Sweden had their wallets or passports stolen every day, highlighting 
that the embassy had issued no fewer than three warnings to Chinese nationals in the last month.

On September 23, the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs in turn published a warning 
on Sweden but without specifically mentioning the Zeng incident. The statement focused on A

C
the allegedly rising number of  cases of  theft and aggression suffered by Chinese tourists.50 T
This seemingly confirmed that the Chinese authorities’ communication strategy O
was reaching beyond the Zeng affair and using it to develop a thorough narrative R

S
about the Swedish society (which in this case was portrayed as dangerous). 

On September 15, in parallel to the embassies’ statement, the Global 
Times devoted an article to the affair using pictures posted 13 days 
earlier on Twitter by @Swedenpoliceto1 and described in the article 
as having been “provided by Zeng”; in the article, Zeng was intro-
duced as the son of  the victimized family.51 This corroborates the A
idea that the account was Zeng’s doing. However, the Chinese ver- C

T
sion of  the article (on Huanqiu.com) used a supplementary photo I
not featured in the English version and which had not been posted O
by @Swedenpoliceto1. It allegedly showed the father’s back with the N

S
following caption: “Zeng father’s bruises after the attack (the marks 

of  blood congestion – i.e. bruising – have not disappeared even three days later).”52

For days, the pictures and the affair were widely covered by Chinese media, after 
the Global Times (CGTN, Caixin, news.cina.cn, sohu.com, french.china.org.cn, etc.), and 
on Weibo where the hashtag #ChineseTouristsMistreatedByTheSwedishPolice (#中
国游客遭瑞典警察粗暴对待) was used 100 million times.53 Chinese-speaking Weibo C

U users also hypothetized about the identity of  the son, Zeng Yi. The most popular the-
C sis was that Zeng Yi was the general manager (总经理) of  the pharmaceutical company 
T
I Tasly in Nigeria (天士力尼日利亚分公司), and the creator of  the Twitter account @
O
N Swedenpoliceto1.54 The testimony of  a former colleague described someone who used to 

travel so often that it had become suspicious; he had previously told a story about how his 
parents made a scene at an airport to take advantage of  a situation.

C However, the prevailing interpretation that the @Swedenpoliceto1 Twitter account is that of  
O the son Zeng is questionable. While this account only ever posted on the day of  the event, about 
N 50 tweets related to the event, it was created earlier and liked about 15 messages between August 
C
E 25 and September 2, mainly about Swedish nationalists, published by Russian media including 
P RT and Ruptly – a behavior that seems to have no connection with the supposed interests of  
T a Chinese tourist. These two very distinct lives of  the @Swedenpoliceto1 account could lend 
S credence to the idea that it is a mercenary account, used first to amplify, albeit briefly, Russian 

media and Swedish far-right themes, and then for a single Chinese operation. This means that, 
if  the operator of  the account in its second period was indeed the son Zeng, he was not an ordi-
nary tourist; and this supports the hypothesis of  a manipulation.

Whether the hotel scene was built from scratch or an incident that involved more 
A
C or less unstable individuals, the embassy took advantage of  the opportune timing 
T of  the affair. Not only did it allow them to turn accusations of  human rights viola-
O tions against critics of  the country, while the Gui Minhai affair was in full swing, 
R
S but it occurred a couple of  days before Sweden’s legislative elections on September 

9, 2018. Two days after the elections, the Chinese embassy released a statement vigorously 
contradicting “rumors” accusing China of  meddling with the election,55 which came as a 
surprise since no one had made such an accusation. The events also preceded the visit 
of  the Dalai Lama to Sweden (he arrived in Malmö on September 11).

Besides, the embassy apparently tried to use Chinese tourists as leverage, as it 
A had previously done elsewhere in the world (→ p. 405). In December 2018 the ambassa-
C
T dor explained that the September incident had “damaged the image of  Sweden in China, 
I hurting tourism cooperation between China and Sweden. Now, the number of  Chinese 
O tourists in Sweden has dropped sharply. We hope the Swedish side will take effective 
N
S measures to repair Sweden’s image in China. We once again urge Swedish police to sin-

cerely apologize to the three Chinese tourists and restore Chinese tourists’ confidence 
in Sweden.”56 The message was clear: if  Stockholm wanted to see Chinese tourists 
return (along with their purchasing power), the Swedish police had to apologize.

C. The reactions to satire
C
A
S The satirical TV show Svenska Nyheter (Swedish News), broadcast on SVT1, covered 
E the Chinese tourists’ affair weeks later, on September 22, in a ten-minute passage dedicated to 

Swedish anti-Chinese bias. The intention was laudable: as they saw it, the program makers were 
not mocking the Chinese but rather the Swedish and their oftenracist prejudices as well as, on 
occasion, their “complete lack of  knowledge about China,” as the presenter Jesper Rönndahl

said. However, toward the end of  the program, they took it a step further: the presenter intro- D
U

duced a short satirical film addressed to the Chinese “so that they feel welcome” in Sweden; C

the film was also translated into Mandarin and posted on Youku, the Chinese “YouTube.” T
I

This one-minute-and-twenty-second clip offered “a few tips to avoid cultural shock,” such as O
N

not defecating outside historical buildings (a reference to the fact that outside the Louvre, a 
Mandarin-only sign asks visitors not to defecate on the floor),57 to not consider dogs as food, to 
eat with cutlery, etc. On several occasions, an icon showed a Chinese silhouette clearly recogniz- C
able by its pointed peasant hat and bowl with chopsticks. Even if  it was meant to denounce O
Swedish racism toward the Chinese, the program used images that were particularly N
insulting to theem: this subtle irony was evidently missed by Chinese authorities. C

E
The show’s producer, whom we met, recognized with hindsight that the program was P

“offensive and stupid.”58 He especially regretted having failed to anticipate the Chinese T
reaction. Thomas Hall, who manages SVT1’s programs, publicly recognized that it was a S
mistake to have uploaded the film on Youku.59

The clip was quickly removed from Youku but it did remain online for several days. 
The embassy protested in a communiqué, demanding an apology; a formal complaint was 
lodged with the Swedish Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. But this was not all: in the wake 
of  the official response came a veritable counter-attack, mounted in a matter of  A

C
days. SVT1 suffered numerous cyberattacks (DDoSes). The show’s Instagram and T
Facebook accounts, the channel’s and the host’s, were attacked by trolls who sat- O
urated them by posting thousands of  hateful messages in Chinese, English and (poor) R

S
Swedish. The number was so high that the accounts had to be temporarily suspended.

Furthermore, it took only a couple of  hours to the Chinese “patriotic 
rapper” Li Yijie (aka “Pissy”), leader of  CD Rev (close to the CYL), and 
already discussed in part two (→ p. 75), to knock out a song about the 
affair that was posted on YouTube on September 23, the day after the 
program was broadcast. It was an impressive but not unusually quick A
response for the band.60 The song opened on the Zeng affair: C

T

First things first/ Couple days ago / the Chinese family arrived at a hostel / in Stockholm / Your capital city / About O
2 a.m. / they got nowhere to go / They just wanna stay in the lobby / Cuz the reservation was for the next night / N
tired and anxious prolly / They were like down and down in a valley, in panic / Then the police removed them from it S
/ What da heck was going on with this? / Is it culture difference? / you just do not give a shieeeet.

All of  this led to the proverbial “pot calling the kettle black” with a verse on the hypoc-
risy of  liberal democracies who ignore their own principles (QED):

Western nations / Sweetie Sweden / always talk about human rights / pay attention / How could you be so rude without C
a reason? […]/ different races / different standards / Western nations always on the rank list / Democracy hypocrisy. A

After a “You ‘bout to feel the power of  Chinese nation,” and “you are just like virus,” came E

N In addition to this online propaganda, human excrement was mailed to the TV 
C station, as well as to the home addresses of  the show’s host and of  the actress who starred 
E in the clip. One of  the station’s executives said he feared for his physical safety after seeing 
P people watching over his home in the morning and evening. 
T
S In an attempt to calm things down, the channel organized a meeting in its offices between 

the producer of  the program, several of  the channel’s executives and three representatives 
of  various Chinese organizations in Sweden, who demanded a public apology and that the 
video be withdrawn. For them the most insulting element of  the caricature seems to have 
been the peasant hat, a symbol of  China’s under-development. They obliged the producer 

A to make his apology on video – in what he felt was a “forced confession.” As he regretted 
C recording the video almost immediately, he asked them not to release it, explaining that 
T
O this would make it more difficult to obtain a public apology.61 The video was published on 
R Chinese media in Chinese, but not in Sweden, and thus did not receive international atten-
S tion.

In the following week’s show, on September 30, 2018, the show’s host decided to 
respond with humor to the hate campaign he was subjected to, explaining that he received 
“tens of  thousands of  reactions, and by reactions I mean images of  me eating feces.” He 
also broadcast a part of  the rapper Pissy’s song. Taking a more serious tone, he apologized 

A for the clip that aired at the end of  the earlier program and that was uploaded on Youku, 
C acknowledging that he had gone too far: “[to] all the people in China and in Sweden – 
T not the government – who were offended by this film, this was not our intention, and we 
I
O should have anticipated that our clip would be perceived as racist. This was irresponsible 
N and culturally insensitive on our part. We are sorry. However, this is not an apology 
S addressed to the Chinese regime, which does not respect liberty of  expression.” 

He then criticized China, with very sensible mentions of  the Chinese strategy in Sweden, 
its aggressive diplomacy, pressure against the media, etc. He also spoke about Gui Minhai’s 
abduction and detention, as well as the rapper Pissy, adding that “if  he [gave] the impres-
sion of  rapping the Chinese government’s press releases,” it was because he worked for 
the government, which financed his rap band CD Rev. This was precisely the case, as we 

C saw (→ p. 75).
A Finally, on October 3, five Chinese associations of  the diaspora in Sweden co-signed an 
S
E open letter, in Swedish and in Chinese, denouncing the program.62

III. The Anna Lindstedt affair D
U
C
T

This affair, which was described as “the biggest Swedish diplomatic scandal in I
O

modern times,”63 started when Anna Lindstedt, the Swedish ambassador to China, N

invited the daughter of  Gui Minhai (→ p. 527), Angela Gui – with whom she had been 
in regular contact – to Stockholm. Angela had been fighting relentlessly for her father’s 
release. The ambassador asked her to travel to Stockholm on January 24, 2019, to try a C
“new approach” and meet with businessmen who could help her. To reassure Angela, she O
said that these were people she “trusted” and that she would be present at the meeting. N

C
When Angela arrived at the rendezvous, a hotel in central Stockholm, she was joined by the E
ambassador and two Chinese businessmen, who invited her into their car and took her P
to another hotel, to a lounge accessible only with a member’s card. She stayed for two T

S
days, during which she was questioned about her personal life and her studies (she was a 
PhD student at Cambridge). She was constantly watched over and followed, even when she 
went to the bathroom. The two men invited many of  their colleagues: “[t]here was a lot of  
wine, a lot of  people, and a lot of  increasingly strange questions. But because Ambassador 
Lindstedt was present and seemingly supportive of  whatever it was that was going on, A
[Angela] kept assuming that this had been initiated by the Swedish Foreign Ministry.” C

One of  the two men told her she had “potential” and proposed that she came with T
them to work in China. He could arrange for a visa with the embassy in Stockholm and O

R
showed a photo of  himself  and his associate with Ambassador Gui Congyou. She refused the S
offer. The following day, the same man told her that he had “connections within the CCP” 
and assured her that her father could soon be released if  she said nothing about the 
matter: “I was told I needed to be quiet. I wasn’t to tell anyone about this, or say anything 
publicly about the case. I was also to stop all media engagement with it. Ambassador Lindstedt, 
who was sat next to me, agreed to the plan. She said that if  my father was released, she’d go A
on Swedish television and speak of  the bright future of  Sweden-China relations, as well as C
express regret over the Chinese tourist hotel incident in Stockholm [of  September 2018], T
and the subsequent coverage of  it on a Swedish comedy show [the case of  Svenska Nyheter I
presented previously].” The man raised his voice menacingly – “you have to trust me, or O

N
you will never see your father again” – and asked her: “what is most important to you? Your S
values or your father?” He added that, if  she kept speaking to the media, she would damage 
“Anna’s” career. The ambassador agreed, saying that China was “adopting a new diplomatic 
line,” where all forms of  broadcast activism would force China to “punish Sweden.” Angela 
finally managed to extricate herself  from this uncomfortable situation and left Stockholm.

The following week she called the Swedish Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and was told by 
staff  that “they had not had the slightest idea this whole affair was taking place. They had C
not even been informed the ambassador was in the country.” Two weeks after the incident, A
Angela told the story in an online article, which she ended by stating: “I’m not going to be S

E
quiet in exchange for a visa and an arbitrary promise that my father ‘might’ be released. 
Threats, verbal abuse, bribes, or flattery won’t change that.”64

This is how the affair started. Anna Lindstedt was immediately removed from office 
and recalled to Stockholm, where she was accused of  “arbitrariness in negotiations with a

IV. Local relays of  Chinese Influence
A The different Chinese diaspora groups in Sweden, somewhat affiliated to the United 
C Front network, are “hometown associations (同乡会, tongxiang hui): the Stockholm Overseas 
T
O Chinese Service Center (斯德哥尔摩华助中心, Sidege’ermo Hua Zhu Zhongxin), which was 
R founded in 2017 with an authorization from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, a united 
S front organ; local branches of  the Chinese Students and Scholars Association; professional 

organizations; media outlets and other networks.”67 The most important actor, the “cen-
tral node,” in this “Swedish United Front community” might be the Swedish China 
Council for the Promotion of  Peaceful National Reunification (瑞典中国和平统一
促进会), created in 2005, which is the Swedish branch of  the eponymous organization that 

A acts around the world to promote the “annexation of  Taiwan.”68 There is also the National 
C Swedish Chinese Association that the ambassador Gui described as the “backbone” of  
T the Swedish branch of  the Council for Reunification, and which received 812,000 Swedish 
I
O crowns (€77,500) of  public subsidies in Sweden between 2012 and 2017.69 
N There are myriad associations (five of  which, for example, co-signed the open letter 
S attacking the satirical program),70 but they are often headed by the same people: for exam-

ple, according to Pär Nyrén, the president of  the Association for Reunification, Ye Pei-qun 
(Sometimes spelled Ye Peiquan in Sweden 叶沛群), is also the president of  a Chinese lan-
guage school in Stockholm, of  the Committee of  the Nordic Zhigong Association (北欧致
公协会) and of  the Swedish Chinese National Association (瑞典华人总会) – whereas his 
uncle, Ye Kexiong (叶克雄), heads the Swedish Qingtian Association. Another example is 

C Zong Jinbo (宗金波), a PLA veteran, who is an honorary president of  the Association for 
A
S Reunification, and president of  the Swedish Tianjin Association.71

ciation (directed by Xueifei Chen Axelsson, who writes for the news website Greenpost.

Executive Group for Sweden (BRIX), which the ambassador Gui referred to as his D
U

“Swedish friends”72 and whose objective is to promote the BRI in Sweden. It was revealed C

in 2019 that one of  its executives, Lydia Liu (刘芳), also president of  the Swedish Hubei T
I

and Hunan Association (瑞典两湖同乡会) and a member of  the municipal council of  O
N

Nacka in Stockholm’s suburbs, had close links to the UFWD. As a consequence, she was 
expelled from the Christian-Democrat party.73 BRIX founding members come prin-
cipally from the Swedish branch of  the Schiller Institute. The president of  BRIX, C
Ulf  Sandmark, is also the president of  the Swedish section of  the Schiller Institute. Based O
in Germany with members from around 50 countries, the institute is one of  the main N
organs of  the LaRouche movement, named after the U.S. politician Lyndon Larouche: an C

E
international political network regularly condemned as neo-fascist, anti-Semitic and con- P
spiratorial (→ p. 326). The small European Workers Party is a Swedish affiliate of  this T
movement. Besides, the German activist Helga Zepp-LaRouche, Lyndon’s widow, presi- S
dent and founder of  the Schiller Institute, has already been invited to a BRIX event. The 
Chinese Embassy, which works regularly with BRIX (the ambassador participated in many 
seminars), has funded at least one of  their events. That the embassy chose to publicly 
associate itself  with the Schiller Institute came as a surprise in Sweden and was 
perceived as “self-sabotage, given the organization’s bad reputation.”74 A

V. The Swedish case as an example of  the Russification of  S
Chinese operations

Several features in the previous pages are symptomatic of  a wider tendency high-
lighted in this report: the Russification of  Chinese influence operations, which we will 
develop again and in more details in our conclusion (→ p. 620). The first feature are the nar- A
ratives used. The ill treatment of  Chinese tourists is a subject that bridges the gap between C
standard “positive” Chinese propaganda (about China) and “negative” propaganda (about T

I
the host country) with which Russia has been familiar for years (even decades in Sweden’s O
case). It still addresses the situation of  Chinese nationals (and China) but chiefly in order to N
criticize the host and it ultimately develops a narrative according to which liberal democra- S

cies are decadent and violent. With Gui Minha, the boot is on the other foot now: while 
Sweden accused China of  violating human rights and the rule of  law, arbitrary arrests and the 
bad treatment of  prisoners (notably Gui Minhai), the Chinese tourist incident in Stockholm 
gave Beijing the opportunity to turn the accusation around and claim that it was Sweden that 
behaves abusively. This strategy of  focusing on incidents, criminality, immigration, 
Sweden’s alleged shortcomings, in order to deter tourism and portray Sweden as vio- C

Second, this convergence of  views between Russian and Chinese authorities, and 
the American alt-right – all pursuing the same objective of  breaking the model of  a per-
fect and happy Swedish liberal society – is backed up by the links with extremist parties

P standing of  Sweden was limited to reading the Russian press (Chinese media in Sweden 
T generally simply republish translated RT and Sputnik articles). All this makes sense if  we 
S see the ambassador as having been sent to facilitate a local rapprochement with the 

Russians, to learn from them and perhaps even to work with them on information 
operations in Sweden of  the kind that Moscow has been conducting for a long time.

Why is China interested in Canada? Because of  the Chinese diaspora first and P
foremost, and for the large number of  assumed or presumed dissidents that lives in T

S
the country. Jonathan Manthorpe explained that “Canada has become a hunting ground for 
the CCP’s agents […] because the country has attracted so many immigrants from greater 
China intent on escaping the CCP.”1 Indeed, out of  1.8 million Canadians that identify 
as of  Chinese origin – nearly 5% of  the population2 – there might be at least 500,000 
Hongkongers, 100,000 Taiwanese, nearly 5,000 Tibetans (the largest Tibetan diaspora A
outside of  Asia),3 and 2,000 Uyghurs (with 300 relatives of  people detained in Chinese C
camps).4 Besides, Canada – which was the first country (in 1999) to publicly condemn the T
persecutions of  Falun Gong members by Chinese authorities – is also a popular destination O

R
for the followers of  this spiritual movement. In other words, because China has made the S
fight against the “five poisons” a priority, hence silencing advocates of  Tibet, the Uyghurs, 
Taiwan’s independence, democracy in China, and the Falun Gong, part of  this fight needs 
to be carried out in Canada.

Furthermore, Canada is an interesting target for other reasons, including its multi-
form proximity to the great U.S. rival, its membership in military (NATO) and intel- A
ligence (Five Eyes) alliances that have raised Beijing’s concern; its position as an Arctic C
nation, a region of  growing interest for China; its image as an exemplary liberal democ- T
racy, making Canada a symbolic target; and its status as an average power, which limits the I
potential fallouts. Beijing also believes it is in a strong position due to Canada’s dependence O

N
on the Chinese market – and Canadian universities to Chinese students – especially in British S
Columbia. It is therefore understandable why Canada was described as a “second priority” for 
Chinese intelligence, after the United States, according to the defector Chen Yonglin. During 
a visit in Ottawa and Montreal in 2007, he stated that no less than “a thousand spies, whether 
official or unofficial and occasional informers,” were working in Canada.5

For all these reasons, China is interested in Canada, and, as Charles Burton sum-
marized it, it offered the following deal to the state: Beijing can help Canada dynam- C

U ize and diversify its economy (to make it less dependent on the United States) by giving 
C Canadian companies a better access to the immense Chinese market and promising colossal 
T
I Chinese investments in Canada, but under certain conditions. To that end, Ottawa needs 
O
N to “1) remove Canadian restrictions on Chinese state acquisition of  Canadian mineral and 

energy resources; 2) remove restrictions on export of  high technology (including with mili-
tary applications) to China; 3) allow the PRC to freely extradite Chinese nationals in Canada 

C to face Chinese justice; and 4) cease all criticism of  China’s domestic and international pol-
O icies and shape public opinion to support better understanding of  the critical importance 
N to Canada of  enhanced engagement with the PRC.”6 This deal is basically meant to incite 
C
E Ottawa to do Beijing’s work in Canada, so that the CCP “could be simply focused first 
P on suppression of  discourse damaging to China’s international image and prestige and sec-
T ond on neutralizing Chinese dissident voices in Canada.”7 
S As Canada refused the deal, particularly after the 2018 crisis strained bilateral rela-

tions (→ p. 544), Beijing has become more offensive. J. Michael Cole, a Taiwan-based 
former analyst at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), and one of  the lead-
ing Canadian experts on Chinese influence, affirms that Beijing uses its entire rep-
ertoire of  actions in Canada: China is not only engaged in traditional diplomacy but 

A
C also uses “instruments of  political warfare to divide Canadian society, manipulate deci-
T sion-making in Ottawa, co-opt or use potential partners in government or parliament, 
O sow confusion through disinformation and CCP-front organizations, interfere in elec-
R
S toral processes, and, where it feels it is necessary, to undertake more direct, punitive 

action, such as lawfare against Beijing’s critics and by ‘weaponizing’ both Chinese 
students and trade.”8

The diversity and reach of  Chinese interference make the Canadian case comparable to 
Australia. And Canada and Australia are very often compared, for reasons that are as much 
historical (the British crown) as geographical (large size, low density, uneven distribution of  

A the population over the territory), political (a federal system, a multicultural society, “First 
C
T Nations” or Aboriginals) or economic (GDP, growth, important raw materials, especially 
I ore, etc.). The two cases are also similar in terms of  Chinese influence: Jonathan Manthorpe 
O noted that “the Australian experience of  infiltration by the CCP is almost exactly 
N
S the same as that of  Canada.”9 This similarity is tied to the comparable trajectory of  their 

Chinese diasporas which, in Canada like in Australia, were initially made up of  former 
Hong Kong and Taiwan inhabitants, and Chinese dissidents (the post-Tian’anmen wave of  
immigrants), but the new generation, which is now more numerous, comes mainly from 
mainland China, migrated for essentially economic reasons, and is therefore more likely to 
be a target and vector of  Chinese influence operations. 

C The CSIS has long tried to draw the attention of  the government, and even of  the 
A public, to this threat, through publications (a joint report on the Sidewinder Operation 
S with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1997, kept secret at first but eventually 
E disclosed (see below)10; a 1998 report on the strategy of  the United Front in Hong Kong11;

O
N

Chinese influence operations have deep roots in Canada.14 Surveillance, infiltration, C
and harassment on college campuses, among other things, which are much talked about E
today, were already used to monitor the fallout of  Tian’anmen in 1989. “In Vancouver, for P

T
example, Chinese students at the University of  British Columbia who had participated in S
protests complained publicly of  being filmed, photographed, harassed, and blackmailed. 
Some have even received threatening phone calls. For others, it was their families back in 
China who were subjected to reprisals.”15 The same thing happened to pro-Tibet activists, 
Falun Gong followers, and Taiwanese independentists – all have long been targeted. 

The 1984 announcement of  the retrocession of  Hong Kong to China, in 1997, A
created a climate of  insecurity in the population (reinforced by the Tian’anmen massacre C
in 1989), and provoked a massive wave of  emigration, of  which Canada was one of  the T

O
main destinations. In 1997, a secret report of  the Canadian Mounted Police and the CSIS, R
untitled Sidewinder: Chinese intelligence services and Triads financial links in Canada, highlighted S
some of  its consequences on Chinese influence in Canada. 

By the end of  the 1980s, Western intelligence services detected strengthening 
UFWD activities in Hong Kong, notably tasked with establishing connections with 
the Triads, which were already tied to business circles.16 Incidentally, more than 237,000 
Hong Kong residents moved to Canada between January 1990 and March 1997, of  which A
70,000 were “entrepreneurs” and “investors.”17 In 1997, more than 500,000 Hongkongers C
presumably lived in Canada, approximately 22% of  the immigrant population. T
Between January 1990 and March 1997, most of  the newly-arrived Hongkongers registered I

O
as “entrepreneurs” or “investors” settled in British Columbia (39.1%) – especially in the N
Fraser Valley, in the Vancouver region – but also in Ontario, in Toronto especially (28.5%), S
and, to a lesser extent, in Quebec (20.6%) and Alberta (7.3%).18

However, some of  these rich businessmen and investors, witht ties to the Triads 
and Chinese intelligence services, immediately bought a Canadian company, 
through a Canadian relative as intermediary when necessary – “so as to obtain a ‘local iden-
tity,’ legally and subtly concealing their foreign identity.”19 Then, thanks to this first com-
pany, they invested massively, or bought additional Canadian companies in different C
fields, “but always under the Canadian banner.” Moreover, they also took care to associate A

U themselves with influential Canadian politicians – “offering them positions on their 
C boards of  directors” – and to invest first in “soft” (non-sensitive) sectors such as real 
T
I estate, transportations, energy and travel agencies – in order to avoid drawing scrutiny from 
O
N Canadian intelligence. With time, they acquired companies in more sensitive sectors, such 

as in high-tech. The CSIS noted that “over 200 Canadian companies [were] under 
Chinese control” in 1997.20

C This poses several problems, including the fact that these companies have allowed 
O Beijing to consolidate its influence in Canada by indirectly financing the two major 
N political parties, the Conservatives and the Liberals – a practice otherwise commonly used 
C
E elsewhere in the world (especially in the United States, where more than 2,000 firms were 
P suspected of  having been used by China to illegally finance the Democratic Party). But the 
T main problem, according to Canadian intelligence services, was that “some Chinese owners 
S are now able to use the Canadian companies they have purchased and some of  the political 

channels they have developed to obtain research assistance and even classified contracts. 
Once access is obtained, few things are in place to prevent them from repatriating the fruits 
of  this research or classified information in China” because “most of  this can be done 
legally.”21 For instance, some of  these Canadian companies controlled by Beijing are in the 

A
C security sector, including IT and video surveillance, and are likely to pass contracts with 
T the Canadian government. Furthermore, the report noted that “these triads now use their 
O Canadian acquisitions to engage in intelligence activities, such as intimidating individu-
R
S als, identifying potential sources of  facilitating visit of  Chinese delegations on behalf  of  

China.”22 
Drafted in 1997, this visionary report concluded that “China remains one of  the 

greatest ongoing threats to Canada’s national security and Canadian industry” 
and that “the great difficulties in determining the threat is that it is diverse and 
multi-layered. It diffuses itself  through elaborated networks held by a cultural practice 

A that still is not well understood by Western services.”23 
C
T Chinese immigration to Canada has changed since 1997: Hongkongers are no longer a 
I majority of  migrants. For diverse reasons, including an increasing living standard in China 
O (some Chinese settle in Canada to invest money), “the majority of  Chinese-Canadians 
N
S in Canada are from mainland China” nowadays.24 Compared to previous generations 

of  Hong Kong and Taiwanese immigrants, they are alienated from Canada’s democratic 
and liberal culture and are understandably more likely to support Beijing. In other words, if  
only for demographic reasons, the risk of  Chinese influence in Canada has increased 
over the past two decades.

At the time, the Sidewinder report was coldshouldered by Canadian elected officials, 
C who refused to admit that Beijing was a threat – so much so that, according to testimo-
A nies gathered by Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuaya, “there was political 
S interference at the highest level to torpedo the report and discredit its authors.”25 As a 
E result, it “was simply thrown away in 1997 before being replaced, in 1999, by a softer and 

more consensual version,” despite the fact that, in May 1999, on the other side of  the

border, the “Cox Report”26 came to the same conclusions on Chinese activities in D
U

the United States: “shell companies, pseudo-research and cooperation institutes, joint C

ventures between North American companies and China, use of  student delegations, T
I

journalists, etc., to gather data, often from open sources, all tactics that are also used in O
N

Canada.”27 
In the 2000s, bilateral irritants accumulated. Mei Ping, the Chinese ambassador 

in Ottawa between 1998 and 2005 had already displayed an aggressive behavior – espe- C
cially when dealing with Falun Gong members. He regularly penned letters and con- O
tacted Canadian politicians to dissuade them from getting in touch with these “mentally N
damaged” “heretics.”28 In 2001, the magazine The Chinese Press, based in Montreal’s C

E
Chinatown, circulated a series of  anti-Falun Gong pamphlets accusing the followers P
of  bestiality, vampirism and of  being driven to suicide – despite a court order enjoin- T
ing them to stop these attacks. The newspaper did it again in 2006 with a special edi- S
tion of  100,000 copies. A Chinese “defector” previously tasked with persecuting Falun 
Gong followers noted that an operation of  such magnitude was probably “financed by 
Beijing.”29 Besides, the frequent visits of  the Dalai-lama (2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2012) 
– the third person in Canada’s history to receive the title of  honorary citizen in June 
2006, after Nelson Mandela and Raoul Wallenberg – and the absence of  the Canadian A

C
Prime Minister at the opening ceremony of  the Beijing Olympic Games in August 2008 T
did not help either. O

Likewise, China’s spying activities and influence operations intensified during R
S

the 2000s. In April 2007, Jim Judd, then-director of  the CSIS, admitted during a hearing of  
the Senate Permanent Committee on National Security that Chinese operations took no 
less than half  the Canadian counterespionage’s time.30 One symptom of  this dispro-
portionate spying activity is the growing number of  employees working at the embassy: it 
suggests that many are “diplomats” in-name-only. In 2008, the Chinese embassy in Canada 
had 120 accredited diplomats, twice as much as the U.S. embassy, Canada’s main economic A
partner. This number went “beyond the traditional needs of  an embassy”31 and indicated C

T
that many of  the employees were apparently intelligence officers working under a diplo- I
matic cover. O

Despite recurring alerts from the CSIS and cases that regularly come out in the N
S

press, political resistance – i.e. the propensity of  elected officials to see China as 
a partner more than as a threat – remains important in Canada, for reasons that 
are both historical and cultural; this is more blatant than in Australia, where a consensus 
emerged in the political sphere circa 2017 on the importance of  the Chinese threat (see 
the box below).

U II. The 2018 Crisis and Its Aftermath 
C
T
I For several reasons, Canadians have become more aware of  the problem since 
O
N 2018. First, as pointed out by Charles Burton, the situation in Australia created a prec-

edent that rippled onto Canada.32 Because both countries are particularly similar, they 
watch each other, compare each other, and Australia’s actions to counter Chinese influence 

C in 2017-2018 (see the box below) sparked a debate in Canada about whether to do the 
O same. Some, like the former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney, praised the 
N
C Australian efforts and asserted that “much of  what Australia has done could be applied in 
E Canada.”33 Yet, many proponents of  appeasement have opposed such measures and 
P instead emphasized the particularities and, therefore, the non-replicability of  the Australian 
T
S case; the need to be reasonable and avoid anti-China hysteria demonstrated by both 

Australia and the United States; the fact that the Chinese-Canadian relationship should not 
be reduced to its sole security dimension; and the efficiency of  the current counter-intel-
ligence mechanism.34 All arguments that can be found among those, especially in Europe, 
who still underestimate the threat posed by Chinese influence nowadays. 

A
C
T
O The Australian Awakening
R
S China was a decisive actor in the economic growth of  Australia for the past three decades. 

As such, Australia’s awakening to the fact that China is not (only) an opportunity, but 
(also) a threat for the country has emerged gradually. In 2015 first, when a controver-
sy erupted over a 99-year lease granted by the government of  the Northern Territory to a 
Chinese company over the port of  Darwin (a strategic infrastructure). The United States, 
who keep a Marines contingent not far, protested, and a polemic ensued, with some voices 
calling for the renationalization of  the port. Hence, Australians took notice of  the importance 

A of  protecting critical infrastructures, and the government created a Critical Infrastructure 
C Center in January 2007, among other measures.
T The Sam Dastyari affair, in 2016, was another step. This Labor senator, who adopted certain 
I pro-Beijing positions (“The South China Sea is China’s own affair. On this issue, Australia 
O should remain neutral and respect China’s decision”), admitted that he had accepted financial 
N contributions from Chinese companies.35 It wasn’t a lone case and several parties were blamed: 
S between 2014 and 2016, the Liberal and Labor parties presumably received $5.5 million 

from individuals and companies tied to China. “Chinese donors are by the far the first 
donors coming from outside of  the country.”36

In August 2016, the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull commissioned a secret investiga-
tion on foreign interference, the results of  which “galvanized” the government and con-
vinced it to adopt a targeted strategy. And the tempo accelerated in 2017. In May, Defense 
Secretary Dennis Richardson publicly declared that “it is no secret that China is very active in 
intelligence activities directed against us. […] It is more than cyber. The Chinese government 

C keeps a watchful eye inside Australian Chinese communities and effectively controls some 
A Chinese language media in Australia.”37 As his Canadian counterpart, the executive direc-
S tor of  the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), Duncan Lewis, noted

that foreign interference was an “existential threat,” “by far and away the most serious D
issue going forward,” even more than terrorism.38 U

C
More and more articles, investigations, and reports on Chinese influence have been released, T
including for the general public, such as a TV documentary on “the hard edge of  China’s soft I
power” which was broadcast in June 2017. It revealed that ASIO had disclosed to the two main O

N
Australian political parties that two generous donators were tied to the CCP.39-40 “One of  them 
leveraged a $400,000 donation in an attempt to soften the Labor Party line on the South 
China Sea.”41

In June 2018, Australia passed two laws against espionage and foreign interferences,42 C
and it created a national coordinator to counter foreign interference. Australia also be- O
came the first country to exclude Huawei from its 5G network that same year. N
The Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 was another step forward, with Canberra questioning Beijing’s C
responsibility and demanding an independent investigation into the origin of  the virus. In re- E
sponse, Beijing deployed a range of  retaliatory measures, including trade sanctions (→ p. 246). P
In December 2020, the Australian parliament adopted a bill to endow the Ministry of  Foreign T
Affairs with the power to scrutinize international agreements signed by the federated S
states (incidently, the federal government announced the cancellation of  the Victorian Labor 
government’s BRI agreement with China in April 2021), but also by the municipalities and 
the universities (which obviously targets Confucius Institutes → p. 299).43 

In May 2018, and with that context in mind, Canadian authorities decided to deny A
a visa to 200 Chinese citizens planning to attend the 9th Conference of  the World C
Guangdong Community Federation ( T

第九届世界广东同乡联谊大会) in Vancouver. O
Jointly organized by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of  China of  Guangdong and R
the Guangdong Community Association of  Canada, it was set in North America for the S
first time. The organizers expected 2,000 participants from around the world but 200 
of  them, including some 20 Chinese officials from Guangdong, were denied access to 
Canada, which displeased Beijing. This unusual and daring decision, from a Canadian 
government that had long avoided offending China, was interpreted as a measure 
of  reciprocity to the practice, common on the Chinese side, of  denying visas to A
Canadian citizens.44 It could be also be interpreted as an attempt to draw a limit on C
the activities of  the United Front in Canada, as this meeting was of  a particular mag- T

I
nitude. That said, the event was still a success for the United Front, partly due to the par- O
ticipation of  the province’s prime minister but also to the forceful images of  Vancouver N
policemen in uniform saluting the Chinese flag. Moreover, retired Canadian sol- S
diers were seen carrying the PRC flag (see pictures). The Canadian decision weighted 
on the bilateral relationship nevertheless.

I The turning point came six months later with the Huawei affair, which remains the 
O most serious crisis in the history of  the Sino-Canadian bilateral relationship. Meng 
N Wanzhou (孟晚 舟), the vice-chair of  the board of  directors and chief  financial officer 
S of  Huawei, was arrested in Vancouver on December 1, 2018, following a U.S. arrest war-

rant. Beijing immediately retaliated, first by arresting two Canadians living in China nine 
days later, the “two Michaels” (Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat turned advisor to the 
International Crisis Group, and Michael Spavor, head of  an organization promoting tours 
of  North Korea) without justification. They were held in inacceptable conditions (no con-
sular access, and at least one, M. Kovrig, in a cell with no access to daylight). They were 

C
A formally charged with espionage on June 19, 2020, a few weeks after (so presumably in 
S response to) Meng Wenzhou’s failed appeal to the Canadian courts. And they were released 
E on September 25, 2021, the same day that Meng Wanzhou, who was under house arrest in 

Vancouver, was allowed to return to China – which confirms that Beijing has been exercis-
ing against Canada an hostage diplomacy it is familiar with (→ p. 411).

The Abduction of  Canadian Citizens U
C
T

There are precedents for the “two Michaels,” including Sun Qian, a Canadian citizen kid- I
napped during one of  her trips to Beijing; another took place in a third country: Huseyincan O
Celil, a Uyghur imam who fled to Canada with his family in 2001 and obtained the Canadian N

citizenship. In 2006, as he visited the family of  his spouse in Uzbekistan, he was arrested by 
the Uzbek police and handed over to Chinese authorities, who sentenced him to fifteen 
years in jail for terrorism. They branded him a member of  the Islamic Movement of  Eastern 
Turkestan, despite official protests from Canada.47 C

Beijing also adopted trade sanctions: they barred almost all Canadian exports of  canola P
seeds, and seriously limited those of  soy, peas, pork meat and beef. Finally, the aggravated T

S
situation of  several Canadian citizens already detained by Beijing can also be interpreted 
as part of  the Chinese response to the arrest of  Meng: Robert Schellenberg, serving a 
fifteen-year sentence for drug trafficking, was suddenly sentenced to death, followed by 
Fan Wei, another Canadian, several months later.48 Sun Qian, a Canadian member of  Falun 
Gong who had been detained for three years, was subsequently sentenced to a particularly A
hefty eight years in prison.49 C

During this crisis, the Chinese ambassador in Canada, Lu Shaye, who became ambas- T
O

sador to France in July 2019, showed notable aggressiveness, on a par with his colleague R
in Stockholm (→ p. 523). Both were precursors of  the so-called “wolf  warrior” diplomacy S
described in part three (→ p. 222). For instance, in an op-ed published in January 2019 in 
the Hill Times, he attacked “Western egotism and white supremacy” and criticized what he 
called “double standards” because Canada was demanding the release of  its two citizens 
detained in China as a retaliatory measure but refused to release Huawei’s CFO (who was 
in fact released on bail and whose rights were protected, unlike the two Canadian hostages A
in China).50 He failed to convince however: public perception of  China has dramatically C
worsened since the beginning of  the crisis. A poll conducted between December 30 and T
January 5, 2019 showed that more than 80% of  Canadians viewed Chinese authorities I

O
negatively.51 N

Likewise, the publication of  Jonathan Manthorpe’s book, Claws of  the Panda: Beijing’s S
Campaign of  Influence and Intimidation in Canada, in 2019, provoked a debate and contrib-
uted to a growing mistrust of  Beijing among Canadian politicians and citizens. Overall, 
revelations in recent years about espionage, influence operations, mass deten-
tion and even, according to some, a Uyghur genocide, along with the violent 
repression of  pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong have, during this 
period, considerably damaged China’s image in Canada, as elsewhere in the C
world. A

U Affairs Committee (CCPAC), is a well-known commentator of  Sino-Canadian relations, 
C and she was all-the-more visible after Meng Wanzhou’s arrest. She published a tribune 
T
I in the Toronto Star, the most widely-read newspaper in the country, to explain that the 
O
N Huawei case constituted “a dark cloud shrouding the psyche of  many Chinese Canadians” 

and that people should be alert to the rise of  “a new wave of  Sino-Phobia.”52 But she 
failed to disclose that her employer, the lobbying firm Solstice Public Affairs, listed 

C the Chinese Consulate General in Toronto among its clients, notably tasked with 
O organizing meetings with Canadian congressmen to “promote various economic and cul-
N tural relations” between the two countries.53 At the time, it was the sole known case of  a 
C
E foreign government hiring a private company in Canada to improve its image, something 
P usually tasked to diplomats.54 Following the ensuing polemic, the Toronto Star decided to 
T add a “clarification” on her op-ed, disclosing the link tying the author to the Chinese 
S General Consulate. Jonathan Manthorpe described the affair as “a good example of  the 

vigilance needed not only by Chinese-Canadian communities, but [the] Canadian society 
in general to identify United Front operations, and the difficulties of  being certain of  the 
evidence.”55

China’s responsibility and behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic continued to 
A
C heighten tensions in 2020. In April, the MP Erin O’Toole – who was elected leader of  the 
T Conservatives in August, thus the chief  opponent to Justin Trudeau’s government – said 
O that Canada was “on the brink of  a new Cold War with China,”56 while Peter MacKay, 
R
S another conservative, demanded that laws akin to the “Magnitsky Act” and others be used 

to target the Chinese responsible for the pandemic.57

That said, these hardliners are opposed by supporters of  appeasement with 
Beijing. In June 2020, 19 eminent Canadians, including two former ministers of  foreign 
affairs, Lloyd Axworthy and Lawrence Cannon, published an open letter to Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau calling for the release of  Meng Wanzhou – a unilateral end to the extradition 

A process – to incite China to release the two Canadian hostages (the “two Michaels”). In 
C
T fact, the letter insisted on the need to “redefine the Canadian strategy toward China” 
I to avoid antagonizing it. Trudeau wasn’t convinced and explained that “releasing Meng 
O Wanzhou to resolve a short-term problem would endanger thousands of  Canadians who 
N
S travel to China and around the world by letting countries know that a government can have 

political influence over Canada by randomly arresting Canadians.”58 In other words, yield-
ing to the kidnappers’ demands would encourage more kidnappings. In another 
open letter published on September 18, 2020, a hundred anonymous former diplomats 
also called for the release of  Meng in exchange for the “two Michaels.”59 In any case, the 
proponents of  the transactional approach were successful, confirming the effectiveness of

exchange for the release of  Meng Wanzhou (→ p. 411). C

Separately, the Uyghur question has grown more prevalent in the Canadian public T
I

debate, with notable political consequences: on January 12, 2021, Canada, along with the O
N

United Kingdom, announced measures “to address human rights abuses in Xinjiang.”60 
Among the seven measures announced by the Canadian government are increased controls 
on exports to China and a ban on the import of  forced labor goods. This move, while C
symbolic (unlike the British, the Canadians do not provide for financial sanctions against O
companies that do not comply with these rules), confirmed that the bilateral crisis, which N
is multi-faceted, is likely to last. David Vigneault, director of  the CSIS, said as much on C

E
February 9, 2021, when he acknowledged that the Chinese government was “using all ele- P
ments of  state power to carry out activities that are a direct threat to our national security T
and sovereignty.” He mentioned the special Chinese operation Fox Hunt (猎狐专项行 S
动), for instance, which, in the name of  the fight against corruption, has been “used to 
target and quiet dissidents to the regime. […] Those threatened often lack the resources to 
defend themselves or are unaware that they can report these activities to Canadian author-
ities, including us. Moreover, these activities are different from the norms of  diplomatic 
activity because they cross the line by attempting to undermine our democratic processes A

C
or threaten our citizens in a covert and clandestine manner.”61 T

III. The Efforts to Silent Dissenting Voices
There are many well-documented cases of  harassment and intimidation of  

Canadian citizens and residents that Beijing sees as dissidents or threats. They 
mainly, but not exclusively, concern people closely tied to what the CCP considers as the A
five poisons (Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong followers, pro-democracy and Taiwanese C
independentists). T

In 2009, Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuya already wrote that “for I
O

years, China’s main objective in Canada has been to control anything that is perceived as a N
dissent. Its intelligence services, along with its diplomats, spend time, energy and money S
discrediting or intimidating its opponents, conducting clandestine operations to infiltrate 
and manipulate pro-democracy, community and student groups.”62 Indeed, several affairs 
had previously underscored the role of  Chinese diplomats in the surveillance, infil-
tration, and harassment of  a number of  groups branded as dissidents, especially 
Falun Gong members. In 2004, for example, the Chinese vice-Consul General in Toronto, 
Pan Xinchun, was convicted of  defamation against a businessman tied to Falun Gong. C
Elsewhere, the police saw two members of  the Chinese consulate in Calgary distributing A

U pamphlets, including one with an explicit title (Falun Gong is an evil cult), “illustrated with 
C bloody images of  immolations, crimes and suicides.”63
T
I In 2006, the visa of  Wang Pengfei, Deputy Secretary to the Bureau of  Education at the 
O
N Chinese embassy in Ottawa, wasn’t renewed, and he was invited to leave Canada after it 

became known that he “was specifically tasked with documenting Falun Gong practitioners 
in Canada and making life difficult for them.”64 Actually, he not-so-discretely relied on “the 

C twenty or so Chinese student associations established in the country’s main universities,” as 
O illustrated by an article published in 2004 by the Chinese Scholar Abroad Magazine in which he 
N thanked the president of  a UQAM student association for its “propaganda activities […] 
C
E and its brave and resourceful activities against Falun Gong.”65

P In March 2017, the Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China, to which Amnesty 
T International belongs, released a report “to draw attention to an organized and sustained 
S campaign of  intimidation and harassment aimed at activists working on China-

related human rights issues in Canada, in circumstances suggesting the involve-
ment or backing of  Chinese government officials.”66 In an update released in March 
2020, the same organizations concluded that, three years later, “the situation is worsen-
ing, […]: incidents of  interference have become increasingly pervasive across dif-

A
C ferent spheres of  society, including a growing array of  tactics and have expanded 
T beyond traditional targets.”67

O
R
S A. Systematic, Aggressive Counter-Demonstrations 

The pro-democratic Hong Kong protests organized in Canada in 2019 nearly system-
atically led to particularly aggressive pro-Beijing counter-demonstrations that mobi-
lized at least dozens (often hundreds) of  protestors in cities (clashes occurred in Toronto, 

A Vancouver, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa and Richmond, in British Columbia) and on cam-
C puses. But these demonstrations usually were not the “spontaneous actions of  individuals.”68 
T
I There was evidence of  “coordination and organization between [counter-] protes-
O tors and Chinese officials.”69 The counter-demonstrations usually begun on WeChat, 
N with messages “suggesting that marchers should be followed, confronted and beaten up” 
S – such as during the 2019 Montreal Pride. On that occasion, pro-Beijing demonstrators 

attacked LGBT marchers favorable to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.70

Some pro-democracy demonstrators are sometimes intimidated, or even dissuaded, by 
an invisible, more pernicious threat: photos of  them could be shot during demonstra-
tions, then identified, in particular through facial recognition technologies and, once their 
identities are known to Beijing, there would be consequences for them (risk of  arrest 

C if  they travel to China) or for their relatives (pressure or intimidation of  various 
A
S kinds).71 Distance is no refuge here: even on the UBC campus, in Canada, pro-democracy

B. Targeted Campaigns of  Harassment and Intimidation N

The fate of  actress Sheng Xue (her real name is Zang Xihong) is exemplary of  such 
attacks. She fled China after Tian’anmen and settled in Canada in 1989 to study journalism. C

O
She subsequently remained there and became a writer and human rights activist. In 1996, N
she understood that Beijing had blacklisted her as she attempted to travel to China and was C
arrested, interrogated, and turned away at the airport. E

In 2012, a month after receiving a medal from the Canadian government, she was P
T

elected president of  the Federation for a Democratic China. From that moment on, she S
was targeted by a systematic and very sophisticated slander campaign that started 
the very day of  her first conference as the president of  the federation, in front of  hun-
dreds of  persons that came from all over the world. As she was on stage, her colleagues 
received emails with – fake – naked pictures of  her. More came later: doctored images 
of  her naked were posted on Twitter and many stories on her purported unrestrained A
sexual life were relayed online by anonymous blogs. This organized campaign, which C

T
involved fake accounts on social networks pretending to be those of  other pro-de- O
mocracy activists, apparently sought to create divisions within the movement, and it R
succeeded: membership in the Federation for a Democratic China rapidly fell from 3000 S
to 100, as the group split into two organizations in 2017, and Sheng Xue resigned. When 
a Chinese-Canadian human rights lawyer, and friend of  Sheng Xue, tried to gather evi-
dence of  this slander campaign in 2016, his computer was hacked and “all the documents 
disappeared.”73

There are many other, less publicized, examples that targeted leaders of  the Hong A
Kong community in Canada, such as Cherie Wong, executive director of  Alliance Canada C
HK. She claimed to have been targeted by “coordinated attacks on social networks,” T

I
including rape and death threats. Once more, WeChat was used to incite hatred and O
to relay calls to harass the woman dubbed “Mrs. Hong Kong Independence” by N
pro-Beijing activists. Cherie Wong received threatening calls, and explained that she had S
been followed and photographed while walking in Ottawa.74 Gloria Fung, president of  
Canada-Hong Kong Link, was presumably victim of  the same intimidation techniques.75 

These techniques are neither recent nor limited to the events in Hong Kong. Phone calls, 
often in the middle of  the night, are a common means of  intimidation. These messages, 
often pre-recorded, include insults, sometimes death threats, or play nationalistic songs 
praising the Party.76 In September 2010, Tao Wang, a NTDTV reporter who had settled C

A
in Canada three years earlier, disclosed to the press that he had received phone calls from S
MSS agents uttering death threats.77 Owner of  a company in China, he explained that E
his clients there had been visited by MSS agents telling them that he “was taking part to ille-

U gal activities in Canada that were damaging to the national security of  China, and they asked 
C them to cease doing business with [his] company.” When he refused to sign a written state-
T
I ment barring him from taking part to political activities in Canada, Tao received another, 
O
N more threatening, phone call: “they told me ‘do you seriously think that we can’t do 

anything to you because you are in Canada?’” Or, “if  you speak publicly, you’re playing 
with death.’” That same day, his company’s bank accounts were frozen in China and his ten 

C employees threatened with unemployment. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police investi-
O gated this case. 
N Similarly, in May 2016, the Toronto-based writer Xin Feng published on the Chinese-
C
E speaking website sinophone51.ca an article critical of  the Chinese minister of  foreign 
P affairs, Wang Yi, during the latter’s visit to Canada. He was subsequently victim of  a cam-
T paign of  hatred. Among the many comments posted below his article, one could read: “‘Be 
S careful that your whole family does not get killed, be careful when you walk outside!’ 

or ‘Butcher this pig. He’s an animal, not a human.’”78 

C. Family and Friends in China Used as Leverage
A
C
T It is well known that an effective way to get someone to give in is the indirect 
O strategy of  threatening to harm their loved ones. And it is even easier when they live in 
R China. The threats are varied: they risk losing their jobs, being arrested, assaulted, or even 
S – in the case of  the Uyghurs in particular – simply disappearing.

Anastasia Lin’s case is well-known because she is a Chinese-born celebrity who immi-
grated to Canada at age 13, became a recognized actress and model, won the 2015 Miss 
World Canada pageant and now works as a human rights advocate. In a profile by The 
Washington Post, she explained how her father, the CEO of  an important Chinese company, 

A received threats and how, “no doubt fearing for his livelihood and business,” he asked her 
C to cease being an activist.79 Chinese authorities wielded both the stick (they confiscated 
T
I her father’s passport, revoked her family’s visas to visit Hong Kong) and the carrot (they 
O brought baskets of  fruits and flowers to her grandparents hoping that they could convince 
N her to keep quiet).80

S Coercing relatives is very commonly used against Uyghurs. One night in 2004, 
Mehmet Tohti, the president of  the Uyghur Canadian Association, received a phone call 
from his mother, who lived in Kargilik, in Xinjiang, and whom he had not seen since he 
fled China sixteen years earlier. His mother quickly passed him on to a man who identified 
himself  as an officer from the Office of  Overseas Chinese Affairs. He enjoined him to stop 
defending the Uyghur cause in Canada and to avoid taking part to a conference planned in 

C Germany with other groups of  exiled Uyghurs. He added that he held his brother and 
A
S mother in the police headquarters in Kasghar – from where they called – some 300 kilome-
E ters away from their home, and that he could ultimately do “whatever [he] want[ed]” 

with them.81

Elsewhere, a Uyghur refugee in Montreal told a journalist: “I received a Facebook mes- D

sage telling me that the Chinese government had arrested my mother, my brother, and my C

father. During their transfer to jail, my mother had a heart attack. My sister was incarcerated T
I

in a special prison where prisoners were tied up in a cell full of  water. [Then,] I received O
N

another message telling me that my father had died. No one in my family was authorized 
to attend the funeral. Only six Chinese officials were there.”82 The Uyghur community in 
France speaks of  similar tactics: “We receive phone calls during which we are told that they C
know everything about our family and that, if  we say bad things about the government, O
something bad will happen to them….”83 N

D. Permanent Surveillance P
T
S

The members of  the tiny Uyghur community in Montreal have repeatedly explained 
that they feel under permanent surveillance. One of  them added that they have all 
“received strange phone calls from the Chinese embassy. A prerecorded message tells 
them to go pick up a package at the Chinese embassy immediately. We never go because 
we know that there is not anything to pick up there. Once, I checked the phone num- A
ber on Google and found that it was the number of  the Chinese consulate in Texas, C

T
and not the one in Toronto as told in the message. Sometimes, they use fake numbers. O
I think they want us to know that, even if  we live abroad, they can control us R
and gather information on us.”84 Another said that his car was robbed, his official S
documents ostensibly stolen, that he was taken in tail from his home by “a Chinese per-
son” and that, ultimately, that kind of  things happens “very often.”85 Even in France, 
Uyghurs feel under permanent surveillance: “when we protest, there is always someone 
filming to spy on us.”86

E. Cyberattacks T
I

Chinese has well-known cyber offensive capabilities. In 2018, at a seminar on cyber- O
N

security, the text of  CSIS Director Vigneault’s speech presented China as “one of  the S
biggest threats facing our countries” in this area (“one of ” was truncated in the tran-
script, meaning that China was presented as the greatest threat).87 On top of  recurring 
attacks against state institutions and large companies – retaliation or espionage 
– Beijing knows how to use its cyber capabilities against identified dissidents. 
In June 2013, for instance, Canadian Tibetan organizations received an email allegedly

group of  Chinese hackers, known as “Earth Empusa,” or “Evil Eye,” which – hid-

F. Identity Thefts

Attackers sent insulting emails to MPs and government officers while imperson-
ating Falun Gong members to discredit them.92 This is a common practice not lim-

A ited to Canada, as explained by a member of  the Canadian association of  Falun Gong: 
C “Government officials at all levels in numerous countries have been systematically and 
T
I repeatedly targeted by fraudulent emails from persons claiming to be Falun Gong practi-
O tioners. The emails often portray the sender as obsessive, irrational, and rude, thus lending 
N legitimacy to the Chinese regime’s claims that Falun Gong is a menace to society […] Some 
S of  the emails have been traced to IP addresses originating in China.”93 In Canada, such 

offensive – sometimes threatening – emails were sent by individuals introducing themselves 
as Falun Gong members to politicians, including to MPs Judy Sgro in December 2017 and 
Peter Julian in March 2019.94

Several Canadian activists were denied a Chinese visa, or werearrested, detained I

and intimidated in Chinese airports – and ultimately “forced to leave China O
 despite N

entering the country legitimately.”95 In 2019, Chinese-born Canadian politician Richard 
Lee revealed that, in 2015, when he was a MP and vice-president of  the Legislative 
Assembly of  British Columbia, he was detained by Chinese authorities after landing at C
Shanghai Airport. He was kept away from his wife for eight hours, his professional phone O
(property of  the government of  British Columbia) confiscated and hacked, and they N

C
called him a “threat to the national security” of  China.96 They eventually cancelled his E
visa and sent him back to Canada. His case shows that Beijing can turn its surveillance P
and counter-measures against any Canadian citizen or resident, whatever their status T
may be. Indeed, Lee was not an activist, but an elected official who did not hesitate to S

defend the democratic and liberal values of  his country, Canada. He commemorates the 
Tian’anmen massacre every year for instance – something that may have angered Chinese 
authorities (the Chinese consul in Vancouver, Liu Fei, had told him as much, directly and 
through his Liberal Party). The fact that even an MP, vice-president of  a provincial A
legislative assembly, could be targeted really means, as he acknowledged it, that C
“it could happen to anyone.”97 T

H. Conclusion S

To sum up, “the attacks range from abusive midnight phone calls to character assas-
sinations in social media, intimidation of  Chinese students attending Canadian col-
leges and universities, holding hostage in China the family members of  Canadian 
dissidents, and hacking the communications networks of  dissident groups […]. In A
all cases, however, the aim is to smother the voices of  dissent in Canada, either by C

T
intimidating Canadians into silence or by so discrediting them that what they say or I
do no longer has public or political impact.”98 O

According to Hao Fengjun, a former agent who “defected” from the 610 Office (610 N
S

办公室), an entity fighting against Falun Gong (→ p. 78), the CCP operates an anti-Fa-
lun Gong spying network of  more than one thousand agents in Canada – Chinese 
Canadians recruited in Canada, professional agents from China, businesspersons and stu-
dents – with activities seemingly concentrated in Vancouver and Toronto.99 According to 
Zhang Jiyan, the wife of  an accountant at the Chinese embassy in Ottawa who, in 2007, 
“defected” and sought asylum in Canada, the embassy had, at the time, “a special unit of  

C
about ten people ‘in charge of  collecting information on groups that could present a threat, A
especially on Falun Gong practitioners.’”100 She added that they infiltrated Tai-chi and S
Qigong clubs to find them. She also explained that the unit produced “material inciting E
hatred against Falun Gong” transmitted by the ambassador himself  to “members of  parlia-

O
N of  the Mandarin-language television station New Tang Dynasty Television (NTDTV) by

T
I Canada, are directly involved in the intimidation campaigns because they them-
O selves pen letters to members of  government, elected officials, media outlets asking 
N them to avoid any contact with such and such groups labeled as dissidents. In 2005, for 
S instance, following the announcement of  an imminent visit of  the Dalai-lama, Chinese 

Consul General in Toronto Chen Xiaoling personally wrote a “warning letter” to 44 city 
councilors asking them to “neither authorize, nor facilitate” the visit, unless they did not 
want to maintain good relations with China.103 “Most of  these letters concludes with a 
not-so-subtle warning. [One] coarse strategy, which can be assimilated to harassment 
because of  its magnitude.”104

C
A Canada is but one example: similar cases testifying to the harassment and intimi-
S dation methods used against human rights activists have been documented in the 
E United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand for example105 – in 

other words, in all the liberal democratic countries with a significant Chinese diaspora. As 
we saw in the previous part, Beijing set up the largest transnational repression cam-
paign in the world (→ p. 166).

Beijing keeps close tabs on foreign politicians with Chinese roots: a training manual for 
executives of  the United Front “notes approvingly the success of  overseas Chinese candi-
dates in elections in Toronto, Canada. In 2003, six were elected from 25 candidates but by C
2006 the number jumped to 10 elected from among 44 candidates.”106 And the CCP does O

The then-CSIS director, Richard Fadden, caused a commotion in 2010, the day before 
president Hu Jintao was set to land in Ottawa for an official visit, when he deplored 
that “there are several municipal politicians in British Columbia and in at least 
two provinces there are ministers of  the Crown who we think are under at least 
the general influence of  a foreign government.” He believed that they weren’t con- A
scious of  being used but, nonetheless, their close ties with the said-government ended C
up “shifting their public policies” over the years.107 Fadden did not mention China but T
his speech was largely interpreted as targeting Beijing implicitly, so much so that a par- O

R
liamentary committee demanded that the government “apologize[s] to the Chinese S
Canadian community.”108

In 2015, an article in The Globe and Mail disclosed that one of  the ministers targeted by 
Fadden five years earlier was Michael Chan, minister of  Citizenship, Immigration, and 
International Trade in Ontario.109 In response, the Canadian Chinese community orga-
nized a defense of  the minister, with help from Beijing. Helen Wang, editor-in-chief  of  A
the Chinese Canadian Post, reported that the Chinese consulate in Toronto pressured the C
newspaper to publish more articles defending Chan. It also asked them to participate in T
a press conference with the Confederation of  Toronto Chinese Canadian Organizations I
(which president, Wei Chengyi, was none other than the newspaper’s owner) to demand O

N
an apology from the Globe and Mail. But Helen Wang was eventually fired, and Michael S
Chan invited to write a weekly column for the Chinese Canadian Post, a newspaper so 
tightly aligned with the CCP that it was previously named the Red Army Post and printed 
in Beijing.110 More recently, in August 2019, Chan intervened during a pro-Beijing event 
and denounced the protests in Hong Kong. This event, as many others in Canada and in 
Australia, was probably organized with some support from the CCP, and some partici-
pants were paid ($100) to attend.111 C

U To seduce Canadian politicians, as with economic or intellectual figures, Beijing noto-
C riously offers trips to China, all expenses paid. Local politicians are targeted, under 
T
I the pretext of  exchanges between municipalities and for the development of  commercial 
O
N relations between regions, but also members of  parliament. Between 2006 and 2017, 

MPs from the Senate and the Commons took a total of  36 trips to China. Many 
of  them were financed by the Chinese People’s Institute of  Foreign Affairs (CPIFA), 

C a United Front organization. On its own, the Liberal MP John McCallum took trips 
O worth CA$73,300 (€47,600) between 2008 and 2015, all paid by the Chinese government 
N or pro-Beijing groups such as the Canadian Confederation of  Fujian Associations.112 
C
E McCallum later became minister of  Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (2015-2017) 
P and was appointed ambassador to China. As he was nominated, he stressed his proxim-
T ity to the country, noting his wife’s Chinese roots and his electoral district, Markham, 
S in the suburbs of  Toronto, which had a majority of  electors of  Chinese descent.113 In 

Beijing, in January 2018, as he welcomed the Quebecois prime minister, ambassador 
McCallum started a controversy when he declared that “in some important policy areas 
such as the environment, global warming, free trade, globalization, the policies of  the 
government of  Canada are closer to the policies of  the government of  China than they 

A
C are to U.S. policies.”114 Similarly, in January 2019, in the midst of  the Huawei scandal, 
T ambassador McCallum started another controversy when he publicly opposed the extra-
O dition of  Meng to the United States, providing Chinese media outlets with arguments 
R
S helping out the defense of  Meng. Likewise, he endorsed a “deal” between the United 

States and China to free the two Michaels (→ p. 546). Several days later, Prime Minister 
Trudeau asked for, and received, his resignation.115 Chinese media outlets subsequently 
criticized Trudeau’s decision, which the Global Times described as “political interfer-
ence.”116 As James Palmer, who worked at the Global Times for seven years, explained, 
China’s disappointment confirmed that its leaders “clearly saw McCallum as an asset, 

A as somebody who they very successfully wooed through this program.”117 It took 
C
T until September to announce a replacement, and the Canadian embassy in China was led 
I for seven months by a “mere” chargé d’affaires. 
O The previously mentioned figure of  36 trips to China between 2006 and 2017 only 
N
S accounts for the trips publicized by MPs, who are bound to disclose any trip paid for by a 

third party – as with any gift. But Senator Victor Oh was sanctioned by the Office of  the 
Senate Ethics Officer because he had not disclosed a two-week trip to Beijing and to the 
Chinese province of  Fujian in April 2017.118 In December 2019, Senator Oh also attended

The MP Vincent Ke
In 2018, Vincent Ke became the first immigrant from mainland China to be elected MP with 
the Progressive Conservative Party and to seat in the Legislative Assembly of  Ontario. His A
past is not very well known (he refused to answer questions from the National Post when it C
prepared a long profile on him121) except that he was born in Quanzhou (China), and that T
he was a student “cadre” at Fuzhou University (according to Alex Joske, student “cadres” I
“often act as informants to monitor students and lecturers for politically questionable O
behavior”122). He later moved to Beijing and was selected as an “outstanding young per- N
son” by the Haidian District (a title that “would likely be administered by the Communist S
Youth League and given to someone on a ‘fast track’ for party membership,” according to 
Charles Burton).123 Ke later studied in Germany, at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum where 
he “participated in the work of  organizing the Ruhr region Chinese overseas students so-
ciety”124 (which seemsto be the local CSSA → p. 280). In 1998, he immigrated to Canada 
and settled in Ontario. Having to justify himself  on his professional past, he declared that 
he worked as an electronic engineer for the German company Conec (which had a factory 
in Shanghai) between 1999 and 2018 in Brampton – even though the professional associa-
tion of  Ontario engineers couldn’t confirm it because he had never been registered.125 He C
was, however, registered as an insurance salesman. In 2013, he was selected by the Chinese A
consulate in Toronto to receive one week of  training in China, the 14th Chinese Overseas S

2. Municipal politicians 

“Municipal politicians are often the prime target,” according to Stephanie Carvin, an 
academic and former analyst at the CSIS.129 They are indeed more accessible and dis-
crete targets. And there are occasions when many of  them can be hooked at once, such 

A as during the annual convention of  the Union of  British Columbia Municipalities 
C (UBCM), that brings together 190 regional and municipal districts, as well as 8 First 
T
I Nations of  British Columbia. In 2012, the Consul General in Vancouver, Liu Fei, decided 
O to organize an invitation-only reception during the event, which eventually became a 
N tradition – so much so that, some years, the consulate was not only a sponsor but the 
S main co-sponsor of  the convention, along with the provincial government of  British 

Columbia.130 China was the only foreign government to sponsor the UBCM. That 
said, it ended in 2019 as the Huawei scandal and the worsening of  the bilateral rela-
tion made China less socially acceptable, and several mayors, including Brad West (Port 
Coquitlam) condemned the sponsorship. In a letter to the UBCM executive members, 
West explained, for instance, that collaborating with the PRC “brings the UBCM into 

C
A disrepute and reflects horribly on all members” because “the Government of  China 
S is engaged in a number of  actions that are hostile to our country’s interests and the 
E interests of  every Canadian, and are completely at odds with our values, the rule of  

law and the very principles that we were all elected to uphold.” He gave three exam-

For Jonathan Manthorpe, “the aim of  the CCP’s diplomats is clearly to turn social 
relationships with B.C. municipal officials and politicians into ones where the Canadians A
feel a sense of  obligation.”134 And some deliver quite well. For instance, Al Richmond, C
a former regional president in British Columbia, who was UBCM vice-president in 2012, T
became a friend to China. He actually acknowledged having grown closer to the Chinese O
government over the years “with the goal of  facilitating trade, tourism and business R

S
connections” for his constituents.135 During the Covid-19 pandemic, in March 2020, he 
told Xinhua that China was “successful in containing the virus” and that Ottawa could 
learn a lot from Beijing. With its enormous global firepower, Xinhua catapulted this 
otherwise unremarkable comment from an obscure local politician to the global stage. 
In June 2019, in the midst of  the Huawei case, Xinhua quoted the same Al Richmond 
in an article untitled “Canadian small Internet suppliers like to use Huawei technology: A

C
local official.”136 T

This CCP interest in local Canadian politics is now well known and has led to sev- I
eral testimonials, including that of  Alan Harris, who recounted how, while running for O

N
municipal office in Clarington, Ontario in 2018, he had been approached by the Canada S
China Industry Promotion Association. This organization invited him to Xining, China, 
to enhance their “friendship” but also to talk about investment and trade – a tempting 
proposal for this rural, poorly connected municipality in need of  infrastructure. This 
time it didn’t work out because Harris was already aware of  the dangers of  Chinese influ-
ence. “I knew enough to ignore the email, but how many candidates across this country 
replied?”137

U B. Elections under influence
C
T
I Electoral interference is harder in Canada strictly speaking than it was in Australia 
O
N and New Zealand before they adopted measures against it, and for two reasons. First, a 

great deal of  influence materializes through money, and Canada has adopted stricter reg-
ulations on contributions to political parties, with an $1,000 annual individual limit. Then, 

C the Chinese in Canada are not too interested in politics compared to other communities, 
O such as Indians, who are very politicized for they share an appetite for democracy with 
N
C Canadians. Now, that could change because Chinese newcomers in Canada are more polit-
E ically active than their parents and grandparents. 
P That said, there are cases of  Chinese electoral interference in Canada. In Australia, 
T like in Canada, this risk is inversely proportional to the level of  education: elites are informed 
S

and politically conscious but, locally, the working-class population is vulnerable. This is the 
reason why Ottawa fears local elections more than parliamentary elections. In 2014, 
Michel Juneau-Katsuya, a former head of  the Asia-Pacific Office at the CSIS, noted that 
“CSIS found evidence that the Chinese Consulate in Toronto was directly interfering 

A in elections, by sending Chinese students into the homes of  Chinese-language-only house-
C holds and telling residents which candidate the Consulate wanted voters to choose.”138

T The Chinese embassy uses local media outlets, but also money, to support certain 
O
R candidates during local elections, hoping to rally Chinese communities on a pro-Beijing 
S platform. They target communities where the density of  Chinese Canadians is important 

enough to have an electoral impact, in the Richmond-Center district of  Vancouver, for 
instance, where more than half  (54%) of  the population has Chinese roots.139 Richmond 
is the “most Chinese city in the world outside of  Asia.”140 In this district, the Chinese 
consulate is regularly accused of  endorsing candidates with a Chinese background. 

The Richmond-based Canada Wenzhou Friendship Society is an organization cre-
A
C ated in 2001, ostensibly to help newly-arrived Chinese migrants. It is also a member of  the 
T Canadian Alliance of  Chinese Associations, a platform of  more than 100 associations with 
I the common objective of  building a stronger Chinese-Canadian relationship (the group is 
O
N known to be tied to Chinese authorities). In October 2018, the Society drew attention when 
S it offered CAN$26,000 (€16,900) to eight candidates141 and encouraged voters – through its 

WeChat group – to vote for specific candidates with a Chinese background in the districts 
of  Richmond, Vancouver and Burnaby, in exchange of  a financial retribution – $20 offered 
as a “transportation subsidy.”142

Beijing’s global takeover of  Chinese-language media outlets – North America included – is 
a problem that has been known for some time.144 Nowadays, nearly all Chinese-language 
outlets in Canada are controlled by the CCP: all that remains for Chinese-Canadians 
hoping to read information not censored by the CCP are Falun Gong-aligned outlets (the 
newspaper The Epoch Times and the TV channel New Tang Dynasty (NTDTV)), which can’t 
be described as models of  professionalism.145 And both are restricted by Chinese (which, A
for instance, cancelled the visas initially granted to their journalists covering the visit of  PM C

T
Paul Martin in China in 2005) and Canadian authorities, trying to avoid angering Beijing I
(when Hu Jintao visited Ottawa in 2005, The Epoch Times and NTDTV were denied access O
to the events; and during a second visit in 2010 as well).146 N

S
To model journalism in Chinese to its own image, the CCP uses its traditional tools: 

the carrot (encouraging newspapers to censor themselves in exchange of  business 
benefits) and the stick (intimidating, threatening, harassing, pressuring relatives 
in China, firing journalists who resist this pressure, or putting an end to programs 
deemed dissident). The CCP also tries to supervise and train journalists, in Canada (a local 
United Front organization based in Vancouver, the International New Media Cooperation C
Organization (国际新媒体合作组织), convened pro-Beijing Chinese-language outlets A
from North America in 2014)147 or in China (numerous Canadian outlets participated in the S

Journalists who do not play by the rules are systematically dismissed. For exam-
ple, the Vancouver journalist Huang Hebian (黄河边) (his real name is Gao Bingchen) 
was a columnist for one of  the most widely-circulated Chinese-language Canadian news-
papers, the Burnaby-based Global Chinese Press (British Columbia), for over a decade. But, 

A after Huang published two critical messages on a personal social media account in June 
C

I minister Michael Chan, the newspaper was pressured into firing Huang.152 In 2017, its

N

Fairchild Radio in Ontario, was fired in October 2019 for being too critical of  China: the 
week before, he had asked a guest how he could be “100% Canadian” and respect the

ers.154 A month before, a host of  Fairchild Radio in Vancouver, Anita Lee, had already D
U

been into trouble after playing the Hong Kong protesters’ anthem on the air (“Glory to C

Hong Kong”). Several days later, she announced that she was taking a break, supposedly T
I

because her son was entering school – which did not convince anyone.155 Then, her show O
N

was officially cancelled in May 2020. 
The fact that almost all Chinese-language media are controlled by the CCP means that 

Chinese immigrants who speak little or no English or French have relatively little expo- C
sure to democratic and liberal values and are therefore unlikely to change: many of  them, O
“even though they have lived in Canada for many years, still have the same communist N
mentality.”156 C

E
Furthermore, there are cases of  information manipulation, including doctored P

translations. For instance, the Sing Tao (星島), a daily Chinese-language Canadian news- T
paper jointly owned by the Hong Kong-based Sing Tao News Corporation and the S
Canadian media group Torstar Corporation (owner of  the Toronto Star, the most widely 
circulated newspaper in the country) had a deal to translate and publish articles from 
the Toronto Star. But, on several occasions, it became clear that the Sing Tao doctored 
the articles it took up “to conform with the CCP’s view of  the world.” In 2008, 
for example, articles on Tibet “bore very little relation to the original Toronto Star stories, A

C
which contained vehement criticism of  Beijing.”157 Another example: the Vancouver Sun T
launched its Chinese version in 2012, named Taiyangbao. But those reading the newspa- O
per in both its English and Chinese versions quickly called out the differences between R

S
them. It appeared that the translators, provided by the consulate, were also cen-
sors that cleaned the Chinese version from everything they deemed unacceptable. 
Hence, the Vancouver Sun found new translators but, within hours, the readership of  the 
Taiyangbao website dropped spectacularly: Beijing had decided to block access to it from 
China.158

O On October 28, 2018, Beijing published a wanted notice for an economic fugitive, Cui

Kong-based newspaper Ming Pao. According to Canadian officials we met, this was the first 
known case of  doxing (i.e. it disclosed private information about an individual to harm them 

C → p. 397). Until then, efforts to arrest fugitives had been more discrete and kept away from 
O the public. The announcement highlights how unlikely Cui is to avoid being found by au-
N thorities, both in Canada (when his official documents lapse) and China. He was targeted by 
C an official program set up by the Central Committee to catch state officials suspected of  a 
E crime who have fled abroad.

VI. An Influence on Education D
U
C
T

A. At the university I
O
N

Canada has always been a prime destination for Chinese students. In 2015, out of  the 
523,700 Chinese studying abroad, 119,335 (nearly 23%) were in Canada.159 Two years later, 
there were already more than 140,000 Chinese students in Canadian universities, accord- C
ing to the Canadian Bureau for International Education160 – including 10,000 at the sole O

N
University of  Toronto. And the restrictions implemented by U.S. universities made Canada C
even more attractive. The problem is that, in Canada as elsewhere in the world, some of  E
these students are working for Beijing (→ p. 273). P

T
In a speech to the presidents of  the 15 largest Canadian universities (U15) in April S

2018, CSIS director David Vigneault declared that “CSIS assesses that China represents 
the most significant and clear challenge for (human-enabled espionage) targeted 
against Canada’s universities,” because Chinese services actively “monitor and influ-
ence” students and teachers. Hence, students and researchers are “non-traditional collec-
tors” of  information for Beijing inasmuch as they “have little-to-no formal intelligence A
tradecraft training but are often in a position to acquire vast quantities of  data or knowl- C
edge.”161 T

O
Two types of  problems should be considered separately: first, Beijing targets R

Canadian universities specialized in sciences and technology to spy and steal S
technologies, using not only students, but also researchers, teachers, and collabora-
tions between Canadian and Chinese laboratories. In at least nine Canadian universities, 
Canadian academics have taken part to dozens of  research projects with Chinese 
military researchers, on topics ranging from satellite imagery or secured communications 
to drones. In some cases, Chinese researchers revealed their military affiliation (because A
they were tied to military universities such as Zhengzhou, the Changsha University of  C
Science and Technology, or Xi’an Jiaotong University). In other cases, however, they hid T
it, pretending to be affiliated to institutions that, in some cases, do not even exist, I

O
such as the “Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute,” a cover used in at N
least 1,300 scientific articles, according to Alex Joske. He noted that this cover was used by S
PLA researchers to travel abroad and, for one of  them, to work at McMaster University, in 
Canada.162 Between 2006 and 2018, at least 687 scientific articles were jointly published by 
Canadians and Chinese military researchers. As in the Australian case, which is very similar, 
it raises the problematic question of  knowing to what extent “Canada inadvertently 
helps China modernizing its armed forces”163 (→ p. 295). 

Second, Beijing also uses Canadian universities to political ends: to control what C
is said on China (content of  conferences, lists of  speakers) and to monitor dissidents A

S
who are invited to speak. In that case, Chinese students are the main actors. E

U Increasingly aware of  these risks, the attitude of  universities with which China has 
C long-standing ties, sometimes going back several decades, is changing: five or ten years 
T
I ago, China was the largest source of  foreign students and was seen as an opportunity. For 
O
N the past five years or so, universities have been concerned that Chinese students are very 

(too) numerous, that they largely live among themselves, do not participate in university 
life, do not integrate, and too often mobilize to defend the interests of  Beijing. So there is 

C a growing awareness of  the problem. During the annual meeting of  the U15, in 2019, 
O one session was dedicated to it and their unanimously acknowledged the risk raised by 
N Chinese influence in Canadian universities.

S Evidence of  the embassy’s intervention in student demonstrations

In 2010, as they prepared for the upcoming visit of  President Hu Jintao in Ottawa, about fifty 
Chinese students who had received scholarships from the Chinese government to study in 
Canadian universities were invited at the embassy. Liu Shaohua, the first secretary for educa-
tion, gave a speech that was clandestinely recorded by the Epoch Times164 and in which he ex-
plained that the embassy would bring 3,000 persons to Ottawa from Ontario, but also Quebec, 

A all expenses paid (hotel, food, transportation, even clothes), so as to organize a welcome party 
C for the president. Some testimonies also mentioned a CA$50 daily compensation. He present-
T ed the visit as a “political struggle” to defend “the reputation of  our motherland” against the 
O “Falun Gong, Tibetan separatists, Uyghur separatists, democracy people [who] have already 
R moved onto Parliament Hill.”
S After reminding students that their expenses would be covered, even those without a scholar-

ship, Liu asked them not to “talk about it outside […] to anyone.” He told them of  the impor-
tance of  being numerous because, during the visit of  President Hu Jintao in 2005, opponents 
dominated and Chinese officials were furious. Hence, they needed to organize a better welcome 
party this time. Then, in case someone asked them why they were there, Liu explained that 
they should respond that “We are here to welcome President Hu. Long live the Canada-China 
friendship.” That same day, Zhang Baojun, in charge of  education at the Chinese Consulate 

A in Toronto, delivered the same message, by email: she demanded that students “comply with 
C the plan and act in unity.” Students with a scholarship who faced “exceptional difficulties that 
T prevent[ed] them from participating,” were required to “provide an explanation.”

O
N  
S

Chinese students do not hide their nationalism on Canadian campuses: they are orga-
nized in associations with a near-military discipline, sometimes raising the Chinese 
flag and singing the Chinese national anthem on university campuses of  British 
Columbia for instance. Some act as de facto representatives of  Beijing: they play a role in 
monitoring and, if  necessary, intimidating students and faculty members on matters tied 

C to China. They also regularly organize demonstrations to defend Beijing’s interests (see 
A examples below). 
S
E This raises another question: is it possible to demonstrate that Chinese authorities in 

Canada (embassy and consulates) effectively mobilize Chinese students, which would 
constitute a proven case of  foreign interference? In Canada, as in other countries where 
the mobilization of  Chinese students is a problem (i.e. in Australia and New Zealand), the 
link is hard to establish, either because Chinese authorities exercise a very discrete 

C control, or because they do not need to be involved as the constraint is internalized:

students, who arrive indoctrinated, indebted (scholarships), and worried about their future D
U

in China and about what might happen to their families, are spontaneously zealous. Most C

of  the time, it is impossible to show an interference and, in a democratic context in which T
I

freedom of  expression is protected, the universities and host countries can’t stop these O
N

mobilizations. 

1. The Role of  CSSAs C
O

The global role of  CSSAs was introduced in Part Three (→ p. 280) but Canada provides N
additional examples. There are indeed many testimonies of  students being pressured C
by a CSSA to dissuade them from doing this, or on the contrary to incite them to E

P
do that. For example, a student at the University of  Ottawa received a threatening e-mail T
from the CSSA of  her university: “according to reports from some other students and S
the investigation done by the association’s cadre,” the message read, “you are still a Falun 
Gong practitioner. Watch out.”165 At the University of  Calgary, CSSA members received 
en email from someone presenting themselves as an agent of  the Chinese Public Security 
Bureau, instructing them not to attend a movie projection organized by the Friends of  
Falun Gong club, “otherwise your name and photo will be submitted to the Central gov- A
ernment.”166 C

T
The CSSAs’ rhetoric often shows that they are merely proxies for Chinese authorities. O

When the CSSA of  the University of  Toronto lobbied the municipality not to recognize a R
Falun Gong Day in 2004, or the University of  Ottawa’s intervened to block the TV chan- S

nel NTDTV, in 2005, they used exactly the same sentences, the same expressions in 
their messages as Chinese diplomats do in their letters of  protest.167

The CSIS confirmed the control exerted by Chinese authorities over CSSAs in Canadian 
universities. In certain cases, it labeled their activities as espionage. This was the case 
of  Yong Jie Qu for instance, a Chinese student who registered at Concordia University in A
1991, took part to the activities of  the university’s CSSA the following years, and applied for C

T
permanent residency in Canada in 1994.168 His application was transferred to CSIS which I
denied it because, as explained in his rejection letter: O

N
There were reasonable grounds to believe that you had engaged in acts of  espionage and subversion S
against democratic institutions […]. By your own admission […] you had communicated repeatedly 
with the PRC Embassy in Ottawa, provided information on the activities of  members of  a Canadian 
student organization [the CSSA] and attempted to corrupt that organization to meet the goals and 
objectives of  a foreign government. […] you readily acknowledged your numerous contacts with 
Chinese diplomats over an extended period of  time during which you helped “reorganize” the CSSA. 
You also acknowledged that you provided information to Chinese diplomats about certain members 
of  the CSSA and that you openly disagreed with the pro-democracy students in the organization, C
identified these students and reported them to the embassy, and sought to change the direction of  A
the CSSA using funds provided by the embassy to support certain activities, to make it “responsive S
to the Chinese government and Chinese officials.”169 E

O
N a WeChat group as they anticipated the conference, showed that they had warned the 

embassy which, in return, asked them to verify whether university leaders attended, to 
take pictures of  the conference and send them to Chinese officials. A Chinese student 

C filmed it and, as he questioned the speaker, insulted her before leaving the room. The 
O coordination among Chinese students and with Chinese diplomats is visible on 
N the screenshots of  the WeChat group they had created for the occasion (see below, 
C
E on the left). We also know that the Chinese consulate in Toronto asked whether Chinese 
P citizens had taken part to the organization of  the conference (on the right).

S The following day, the university’s CSSA released a statement

future “the dignity” of  Chinese students is not violated.
Suspected of  having intervened because the message was 
written in the usual style of  official CCP communiqués, the 

C embassy denied it while considering the students’ approach 
A “just and patriotic.”172 The Washington Post, which copied and

to find written evidence of  apparent coordination with 
[Chinese] officials.”173 David Mulroney, the former Canadian

ambassador to China added that “the fact they want to know which academics attend hints D
U

at desire to stop academic freedom.”174 C

On February 16, the embassy released a statement affirming that “what happened T
I

recently at the University of  Toronto [see below] and McMaster University has nothing O
N

to do with the Chinese Embassy and Chinese Consulate General in Canada” but also that 
(in the following sentence) “we strongly support the just and patriotic actions of  Chinese 
students.”175

C
Acting on a demand from other students, some of  whom found “extraordinarily O

terrifying […] to know that an organization – in its capacity as an [student union]-rat- N
ified club – reported activity on campus to the Chinese government,” the CSSA was C

E
finally dissolved on September 2019, with 22 student representatives out of  35 voting P
in favor.176 T

Another interesting case occurred at the same time, on the Scarborough campus S
of  the University of  Toronto: that of  Chemi Lhamo, a 22-year-old Canadian student 
of  Tibetan origin. In February 2019, as she had recently been elected president of  a 
students’ association, she was targeted by a pro-Beijing and anti-Tibetan hatred 
campaign. An Instagram picture of  her was the object of  thousands of  heinous 
and threatening comments such as “China is your daddy – you better know this,” or A

C
“Ur not gonna be the president of  UTSC […] Even if  you do, we will make sure things T
get done so u won’t survive a day. Peace RIP.” A petition demanding her resignation, O
and promoted by the CCP’s English newspaper Global Times,177 received almost 10,000 R

S
signatures. A message also circulated on WeChat asking Chinese students to do every-
thing they could to prevent the student association from being “controlled by Tibetan 
separatists.”178

Michel Juneau-Katsuya believed that “it [was] beyond plausible” that the Chinese gov-
ernment was involved in the campaign: “It is their strategy to try to undermine, to try to 
mute any form of  opposition or dissidence that could at one point or another gain access A
to a mic.”179 C

T
Chinese authorities do not always wait and use students as proxies: they some- I

times intervene directly. For instance, the day before a conference with the president O
of  the World Uyghur Congress, Dolkun Isa, at Montreal’s Concordia University, in N

S
March 2019, the organizer, Kyle Matthews, who headed the Montreal Institute for 
Genocide and Human Rights Studies, received en email from Consul General Xing 
Wenjian asking for an “urgent meeting” to which he did not answer. The consulate 
also contacted Montreal officials to try to cancel the event.180 But it was not met with 
success.

O
N affected, not only by the problem of  aggressive counter-demonstrations, harassment 

and intimidation of  student human rights activists (there have been several incidents, 
with torn down posters, anonymous letters, etc., in high and secondary schools across 

C the country, particularly in British Columbia).181 Controls and censorship over academic 
O content is also a problem. And, once again, Confucius Institutes (CIs) are blamed 
N
C (→ p. 299) because the 13 Canadian institutes are “typically affiliated with postsecondary 
E education institutes and K-12 schools.”182 The first Canadian CI opened at the British 
P Columbia Institute of  Technology in 2006. In February 2009, there were at least five 
T others: in Edmonton (Alberta School for the Deaf), Waterloo (University of  Waterloo – 
S

twinned to Nanjing University), Moncton (Atlantic Education International), Montreal 
(Dawson College) and Sherbrooke (Université de Sherbrooke).183 And they sometimes

C In 2019, the New Brunswick Ministry of  Education cancelled the contracts that tied 
T the CIs to two dozen middle schools in the province after parents complained about

R restrictions on the freedom of  expression of  the pupils on topics related to China. 
S Some teachers, for instance, forbade any discussion of  the Tian’anmen mas-

sacre and used maps that integrated Taiwan into China. The minister acknowl-

[its] influence.”185 Before that, several universities (McMaster, McGill, Manitoba, and 
Sherbrooke) had done the same, or altogether refused to host a CI for these reasons 
(censorship or a control by the Chinese government that was seen as incompatible with 

A
C academic freedom and so on). 
T In October 2019, in a Chinese language course at a Richmond high school, in British 
I Columbia, the fifteen-year-old pupils were shown a propaganda film untitled My 
O
N People, My Country (2019) on the occasion of  the 70th anniversary of  the PRC, 
S and were tested with a questionnaire untitled “I love my country.” The question-

naire was politically oriented, with questions such as “which words, or sentences from 
the movie made you feel good?” Following the ensuing controversy, the test was 
cancelled.186

T

O since 2013.191 They are overseen by the Jinan-based Shandong Friendship Publishing House 
N (山东友谊出版社), created in 1986 in the administrative center of  Shandong. This publish-

ing house produces content to introduce foreign publics to the Chinese culture,192 a form of  
“external propaganda” (对外宣 传).193 The company is owned by the Shandong Publication 

C Group Co., Ltd (山东出版集团),194 an entity financed by the Financial Bureau of  Shandong 
O (山东省财政厅).195

N The Nishan bookstores – from the name of  the mountain where Confucius was presumably 
C born – are the overseas editors of  the publishing house, tasked with promoting cultural ex-
E changes between China and the rest of  the world.196 It began with two bookstores in China in 
P 2012, at the Confucius Research Institute (曲阜孔子研究院) and at the Nishan Shengyuan 
T Academy (尼山圣源书 院).197 Then, three dozen foreign antennas have opened since 2013, 
S including in Valletta, Moscow, Warsaw, Auckland, Macerata, Buenos Aires, Canberra, Gdansk, 

New York or Los Angeles.198 After 2018, others were opened at the Richmond Public Library, 
in Vancouver,199 at the Confucius Institute of  Eötvös Loránd University, in Budapest,200 at the

At that precise moment, two letters of  endorsement apparently written by Prime

rough counterfeits with grammar mistakes – circulated on Facebook and Twitter. O
Several days later, a spokesman for the Prime Minister Office confirmed that the letters had N
been fabricated. In response, the TAC declared that it had nothing to do with the opera- C

B. WeChat’s role
C

The Chinese phone messaging app WeChat (→ p. 196) is increasingly used in Canada, A
and not solely by the Chinese community: politicians, for instance, are growing more accus- S
tomed to using it in Canada, as in the United States, to reach Chinese-speaking voters. E

As noted earlier, WeChat seems systematically used when organizing pro-Beijing 
counter-demonstrations in reaction to events linked to the “five poisons.” Another prob-
lem arises from this: Beijing is permanently censoring content on the app: discus-
sions are monitored and, sometimes, doctored. A professor at a Canadian university shared

O
N deleted a Member of  Parliament’s message to constituents praising Hong Kong’s Umbrella 

Movement protesters, manipulated dissemination of  news reports related to Huawei exec-
utive Meng Wanzhou’s arrest, and blocked broader media coverage of  Chinese government 

C corruption and leading Chinese officials.”206 Beyond intervening on the content, Chinese 
O intelligence uses overseas WeChat groups to detect dissidents and gather personal 
N data.
C
E Finally, a scandal forced the prime minister to intervene: the 
P WeChat account of  a Liberal minister was used, without 
T her knowledge, to raise funds to finance the legal pro-
S ceedings against a journalist critical of  Beijing. On April 

30, 2020, the journalist Sam Cooper published on globalnews.
ca an article showing that in mid-January, while China was 
concealing the extent of  the coronavirus epidemic that hit it, 
it mobilized its relays around the world to acquire and stock-

A
C pile a gigantic number of  personal protective equipment (2.5 
T billion in six weeks) such as masks, that consulates in Canada 
O relayed these calls and that groups linked to the United Front 
R
S bought and sent to China a large number of  these items – 

which a few weeks and months later would be sold at a high 
price by China to the whole world.207 Several members of  the 
Chinese Canadian community considered the possibility of  a 
class action lawsuit against the journalist and the newspaper.208 
To that end, a person called Maria Xu, a member of  Joyce 

A Murray’s WeChat group – Vancouver’s Liberal MP, president of  the Treasury Board and 
C
T Minister of  Digital Government in the Trudeau Cabinet – published a message in the 
I group with a link to a website collecting donations to fund this lawsuit. Once it was detected, 
O the message was deleted and Maria Xu excluded from the WeChat group. At that point, the 
N
S prime minister intervened to denounce the attacks against the journalist as “absolutely 

unacceptable” and Murray’s office explained that WeChat was “used to engage members of  
the Chinese Canadian community” and that “this particular post was unacceptable and in 
no way reflects the Minister’s views. Participation in this group is guided by posted guide-
lines and a disclaimer. In this case, guidelines were not followed and the individual who 
posted is no longer in this group.” In turn, Global News explained that it was “increasingly 

C concerned by what appears to be an organized effort to discredit our journalist, our report-
A ing and our news division as we investigate the serious issue of  foreign influence in Canadian 
S affairs.”209

VIII. A Myriad of  Local Organizations as Relays D
U
C
T

In Canada, and particularly in Vancouver and Toronto, there are many Chinese asso- I
O

ciations, organizations and groups. Some are old, such as the Chinese Benevolent N

Association of  Vancouver (1896), the Canada-China Friendship Society in Ottawa (1976) 
and the Federation of  Canada-China Friendship Associations (1980). And all of  them are 
more or less linked to the UFWD, hence to the CCP. The groups “promoting the C
pacific reunification of  China,” directly affiliated to the UFWD, are the easiest to uncover. O
For instance, three Vancouver groups belong to that category: the China Unification N

C
Promotion Council (CANADA) (加拿大中国统一促进会), created in 1999; the Canada E
Chinese Peaceful and Unification Association (加拿大中国和平统一促 进会), cre- P
ated in 2003 to help newly arrived migrants, and the president of  which, Wang Dianqi (王 T

S
典奇), made a name for himself  after he convinced a city councilor to raise the Chinese 
flag in front of  the Vancouver city hall while wearing a red scarf  (which is largely 
interpreted in the Chinese Canadian community as a symbol of  loyalty to the Communist 
regime) on the occasion of  the 67th anniversary of  the PRC210; last but not least, the North 
America China Council for the Promotion of  Peaceful National Reunification (北美 A
温 哥华中国和平统一促进会), created in 2016. C

The 2019 Hong Kong crisis made it easier to clarify, where it was still necessary, how E

a large number of  Chinese associations in Canada position themselves toward Beijing. A 
statement released by the Chinese Benevolent Association of  Vancouver in June 
2019, and signed by 208 associations, adopted the CCP’s rhetoric almost to the 
word212:

N are paying a close attention to the development of  the current Hong Kong situation, we are obliged

C The list, which was very usefully translated in English,214 gives an overview (probably 
O non-exhaustive) of  the reach of  Chinese influence in the non-profit sector tied to 
N
C Chinese Canadian communities. Among the 208 groups, at least 80 had apparently 
E recently been created, “reflecting the huge surge in mainland Chinese migration since about 
P 2000.”215 If  many of  the signatories have established ties to the Chinese government, 
T a few elements made some observers believe that the letter was guided by Chinese author-
S

ities, including sentences presenting Hong Kong as “an internal affair of  China,” oppos-
ing “the interference of  any foreign forces,” and an endorsement of  ethnic nationalism 
(Chinese Canadians are “all the children of  Emperor Yan and Emperor Huang [two of  
China’s mythic founders],” their “blood being thicker than water”)216 that we mentioned in 

A the section dedicated to the diasporas (→ p. 165).
C This proliferation of  groups made of  a multitude of  subgroups is a “kind of  United 
T Front tactic,” according to Fenella Sung of  the Canadian Friends of  Hong Kong: “it’s 
O very easy to form a community group. You do not even have to register. If  you’re not 
R
S incorporated, you can just get together [even] two or three people … and form a group.” 

In other words, “it’s really bluffing more than anything. They want to show they are 
stronger and have more people than they really have.”217 Cheuk Kwan, of  the Toronto 
Association for Democracy in China added that “these are basically fake organizations.” 
“They are what I call the mouthpieces of  the Chinese consulate. This is a very clearly 
United Front effort by the Chinese government.”218

A
C A similar operation was organized globally in August 2019: a statement signed by 583 
T Chinese organizations worldwide was circulated by the Chinese embassy in Ottawa,219 
I which advertised the involvement of  204 Chinese organizations from Canada.220 Another 
O
N example took place in October 2019 with an ad in the Chinese Canadian Times bought by 
S the Council of  Newcomer Organizations, a self-described apolitical association subsidized 

by the Canadian government – a detail that caused a public uproar (the spokesperson of  
Canadian Friends of  Hong Kong condemned “our government” for “using taxpayers’ 
money to enable CCP influence and infiltration into our society and politics”).221

The Transformation of  S.U.C.C.E.S.S. T
I

The United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (S.U.C.C.E.S.S.) is an organi- O
zation based in Vancouver that provides social services to Chinese immigrants. Created in N

1973, it is one of  the largest social services agencies in the country, helping more than 60,000 
persons on a budget of  CA$50 million (€32.5 million) granted by the government. For years, 
S.U.C.C.E.S.S. used to denounce the Tian’anmen massacre by signing a joint statement with 
other organizations on the day of  the commemoration of  the bloody repression. In 2019, C
however, on the 30th anniversary of  the event, the organization kept silent – which did not go O
unnoticed.222 But the demographics had changed: more than 40% of  its “clients” now come N
from mainland China, and no longer from Hong Kong. C
In recent years, S.U.C.C.E.S.S. apparently turned its back: in 2015, the Overseas Chinese E
Affairs Office (→ p. 69) labeled it an “Overseas Chinese Service Centre” (OCSC). As Matt P
Schrader showed with one Toronto-based OCSC, there are proven ties between the centers T
and the CCP (the Toronto center sent a New Year’s card “on behalf  of  the Consul General S
of  the PRC” that included praise for the 19th CCP Congress and, the year before, hosted 
a welcome banquet for the new consul general during which Lin Xingyong, the president 
of  the Confederation of  Toronto Chinese Canadian Organizations, declared that “[We 
will] give Consul He our strongest support and cooperation”).223 The decision to label 
S.U.C.C.E.S.S. an OCSC wasn’t anodyne. In fact, the agency also opened an office in Beijing 
and its members are increasingly parading with diplomats from the Chinese consulate and A
other pro-Beijing communitarian groups. As such, many of  those who had known and C
respected the work of  this agency in previous decades are now surprised and disappointed T
by this evolution. O
The Australian precedent is interesting here: the equivalent of  S.U.C.C.E.S.S. in Australia, the R
Chinese Australian Services Society, based in Sidney, was also labeled an OCSC.224 As a con- S
sequence perhaps, it started to get involved in foreign policy matters in 2017, with a paper 
suggesting that Australia should reconsider its “strategic alignment with the United States” and 
develop its relations with China instead.

C A public holiday to commemorate the Nanjing massacre
T
I In October 2017, the legislative assembly of  Ontario adopted a motion introduced by MP Soo 
O Wong (she was born in Hong Kong and moved to Canada at eight) that designated December 
N 13 as a day of  commemoration for the Nanjing massacre. In 2018, several organizations235 

took part to a campaign to convince the federal government to create a public holiday to com-
memorate it. It was relayed by Jenny Kwan, a New Democratic Party MP who represents East 

C Vancouver in the Canadian parliament. Her speech, in July 2018, stirred a controversy; and 
O Japanese and Japanese Canadians, among others, protested. She has not been met with success 
N for now. Nonetheless, several months later, in October 2018, Kwan inaugurated a monument 
C dedicated to the victims of  the Nanjing massacre, in the Richmond Hill neighborhood of  
E Toronto – the first outside of  China – with two organizations (Confederation of  Toronto 
P Chinese Canadian Organizations and Chinese Freemasons of  Canada (Toronto)).

In August 2018, the creation of  an association of  PLA veterans residing in Canada, 
the Canada Chinese Veteran’s Society, led to protests. Sherman Lai, himself  a PLA veteran 
(lieutenant-colonel) teaching at the royal military college in Kingston, Ontario, held that 

A “they took advantage of  democracy, of  the Canadian system … But communism, the PLA 
C
T is not compatible with democracy and the rule of  law. Before their nostalgia, there is a very 
I bloody history,” including the intervention of  Canadian troops during the Korean War.237 
O Others called out the PLA for its role in state repression, from Tian’anmen to Hong Kong 
N
S demonstrations, without forgetting Tibet and Xinjiang for instance. The association, which 

organized events, created a choir called “Companions in arms,” for instance, which 
performed in military uniforms and sang military patriotic songs during a festival 
in Richmond (British Columbia) in October 2019 (see image below). The association had 
apparently disbanded in June 2020.238

IX. Seducing First Nations A
C
T

Chinese authorities in Canada are engaged in a strategy of  seduction of  First Nations I
O

that could be used to divide the Canadian society. They play on the proximity between N
Chinese immigrants and First Nations, which both assert they are victims of  discrimina- S
tions in Canada. 

This can be done in subtle ways, as with the Musqueam, an Aboriginal population 
in the Vancouver area. Some of  them have Chinese ancestry because, from the early 20th 
century to the 1970s, Chinese migrants from Guangdong lived and worked on farms on 
the reserve and had children with Musqueam women. Two documentaries – Peeking into the 
Pink Houses at Musqueam: A Migration Story (a short movie by Sarah Ling, 2015) and All Our C
Father’s Relations (a feature film by Alejandro Yoshizawa, 2016) – tell the story of  one of  A

S
these mixed families, the Grants, brothers and sisters who shared a Chinese father and a E
Musqueam mother. 

The synopsis of  the second film announced to the viewers that, “as far back as the 19th 
century, relations between Chinese and First Nations in Canada were often respectful and 
mutually beneficial; both peoples supported one another in the face of  marginalization 
and racism.”239 This bilingual production, in English and Chinese, recorded the family when C

O
they travelled to China in 2013 and first visited the village in the Guangdong province that N

The history of  the Grant family is endearing, and there is no doubting the sincerity of  D
U

anyone, including at the Chinese consulate. But this example pertains to a larger strategy of  C

seducing First Nations. The Musqueam case is specific because some are consid- T
I

ered “almost Chinese.” In August 2016, the consul general organized a meeting between O
N

Musqueam individuals and Sino-Canadian entrepreneurs.247 In 2019, the joint international 
MBA program of  the University of  British Columbia (UBC) and Jiao-tong University, in 
Shanghai, sent some Chinese students spend two weeks in Vancouver. In fact, since 2019, C
an “introduction to the heritage of  the Musqueam autochthone nation” was added to their O
curriculum, during which Larry Grand tells them his personal history.248 N

The consulate has not forgotten the other commu- C
E

nities. In December 2015, the consul general Liu Fei P
met Grand Chief  Edward John249 of  the Tl’azt’en T
Nation. He is one of  Canada’s main autochthonous S
political leaders and married to a former Musqueam 
chief. The Secwepemc are also wooed, especially Mike 
Archie, the former Secwepemc chief  in Canim Lake 
(BC). In late January 2019, he was invited to China by 
the CPAFFC (Chinese People’s Association for A

C
Friendship with Foreign Countries), first to Hefei, to danse at “The Belt and Road World T
Dance Conference,” and then to Beijing. The objective was to show a particular proximity O
between Canadian First Nations and China, as made evident by the media coverage of  Mike R

S
Archie’s trip, which stated that “we established a friendship with Chinese people from 
China who participated in mining gold panning and building railways more than 
160 years ago” (which implied that they were both exploited by English Canadians), and 
that “the visit showed how the BRI brings together world cultures,” with many pictures to 
support that idea.250

does not stop at modeling the national debate on China, censoring the “five poison” D
U

through pressure on media, and interfering with schools and universities for instance. C

It also targets the Canadian society and its government in an attempt to divide the pop- T
I

ulation. For now, like in Sweden, it remains at an intermediate stage where the O
N

negative discourse is still linked to China (i.e. it mirrors a positive narrative that 
is about China). 

Some attacks are anecdotic. For example, they have instrumentalized the legalization C
of  marijuana: Chinese media alerted Chinese Canadians to the dangers of  marijuana-filled O
candies on their children.253 There are several possible explanations: to try to draw Chinese N
communities in Canada away from Ottawa (by creating mistrust) and closer to Beijing (by C

E
playing the values card); to show that Beijing cares about the well-being of  its “flock” all P
around the world, regardless of  citizenship, and that there is therefore a form of  ethnic sol- T
idarity; but also, according to some, because Beijing does not rule out developing a cannabis S
industry one day: it is therefore in its interest to limit the success of  Canadian cannabis in 
order to export some. 

Cannabis is one of  the potentially divisive issues that may put the Chinese com-
munity at odds with its host country Canada. But there are additional buttons in 
Beijing’s arsenal, including same-sex marriage, real estate investments, shark fins (a picture A

C
of  Vancouver’s Richmond MP Alice Wong eating a shark fin soup caused a controversy in T
2012) and, obviously, the purported Sinophobia of  Canadians and their government. O

Rightly or wrongly, many Chinese Canadians (like their Australian counterparts) R
S

feel discriminated. Then, Chinese authorities and their proxies (associations, entrepre-
neurs, and students) have an easy time coming to their rescue with a twofold message. First, 
racial unity. The language used in the June 2019 statement about Hong Kong, which was 
signed by more than 200 pro-Beijing associations (→ p. 577) wasn’t anodyne: it explicitly 
called for racial unity, invoking the Chinese “blood” tying foreigners of  Chinese 
descent, including Canadians, to the population of  mainland China. Bill Chu, of  A
the Canadians for Reconciliation Society, was right to point out that “it’s divisive to say the C

T
least. It’s trying to shift our allegiance from one country [Canada] to another [China].”254 I
This is precisely their objective: to convince Chinese Canadians that they are closer to O
Beijing than to Ottawa. The same logic was rolled out for First Nations which share, if  N

S
not the same blood (as is the case of  some Musqueam people), at least the same position 
as victims. 

Second, this narrative highlights the CCP’s importance: “you are being discriminated and 
the solution to that is to have a powerful motherland – China. But without the CCP, your 
motherland will be weak. In other words, your ability to stand tall as a Canadian depends 
on the CCP, not your own ability or the values of  Canadian society.”255 Sometimes, the C
message is subtle, internalizing the liberal thought: “you do not need to be with us, and we A
can keep our political, ideological, cultural differences. You do not need to embrace the S
CCP but, as we share the same blood, belong to the same group, we will help you.” This E

powerful message can bear fruits. Hence, Sinophobia is dangerous as it provides China 
with opportunities for influence operations.

U Other attacks occurred during the Huawei affair, for instance to turn the stigma 
C around: has Canada really respected the rule of  law that it claims to champion when it 
T
I arrested Meng? Was this arrest really compatible with the democratic and liberal values that 
O
N Ottawa is supposed to uphold?

As with Russian operations,256 divisions are envisioned as both internal (here, divid-
ing the Canadian society, particularly the Chinese community from the rest) and external 

C (amplifying potential tensions between a country and its neighbors). The Huawei case 
O certainly allowed Beijing to maintain and deepen existing tensions between Canada 
N and the United States by spreading the narrative that, contrary to appearances, this was 
C
E not a problem between Canada and China but between Canada and the United States, 
P with Ottawa unwillingly finding itself  in the crossfire of  a Chinese-American cold war 
T after it bowed to pressure from Washington to stop Meng. Beijing exploited the growing 
S anti-American sentiment in Canada by circulating the idea that Washington “threw Canada 

under the bus.” Furthermore, it played on moral equivalences: China is tough, but so is 
the United States, and Canada is the victim. This strategy began at the start of  the scandal, 
and received somewhat encouraging news in late October 2020 when the Supreme Court 
of  British Columbia authorized Meng Wanzhou’s lawyers to plead that Canada had been 

A
C dupped by the United States in obtaining her arrest.257

T For now, Chinese operations in Canada remain tied to the Chinese community. 
O But their progressive Russification implies their future “desinization” – the oper-
R
S ations will probably grow beyond issues of  interest to the community to target societal 

issues that concern all Canadians. This is already apparent in the use of  English-language 
media to try to reach, on the one hand, Chinese Canadians who do not speak Chinese, 
such as second or third generation immigrants and, on the other hand, all Canadians. It is 
then important to underline, as Jonathan Manthorpe did, that Chinese Canadians are not 
the only ones targeted: “Non-Chinese Canadians are just as likely to be recruited as 

A agents of  influence by the United Front and Beijing’s other intelligence services. 
C
T Indeed, because of  naïveté, ignorance, or sheer venality, non-Chinese Canadians are often 
I easy recruits for Beijing. Chinese immigrants are more experienced with the regime most 
O of  them have come to Canada to escape.”258

THE INFEKTION 2.0 OPERATION I
O

DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (2020)
C
O
N
C
E

The exact origin of  the pandemic remains unknown at the time of  writing, and for good P
reason, as Beijing still refuses an independent investigation.1 But it appears that the SARS- T

S
CoV-2 virus was found in the Hubei province (central China) as early as October 2019.2 The 
magnitude and prevalence of  the contaminations rapidly unsettled healthcare systems and 
the societies hit by the virus. And, in the political sphere, the pandemic has already taught us 
a lot. For observers of  China, it revealed obvious elements that had long been forgotten and 
it undermined the prevalent common sense. For instance, the weight of  local institutions in A
the Chinese political model, a legacy of  a singular state trajectory, came to the fore; the local C
state appeared for what it has always been: a political level resistant to the ambitions of  the T
center, quick to scupper the policies decided by the Party.3 This could be seen in the clashes O

R
between the Hubei and Jiangxi police forces after the lockdown was lifted for the inhabitants S
of  Wuhan.4 The crisis provoked by the virus has also prompted us to qualify the analyses of  
those presenting Xi Jinping as a new hegemonic Mao, perhaps forgetting too hastily that Xi’s 
accumulation of  power has not entirely eliminated the internal rivalries, the deleterious effect 
of  the suspension of  the rules of  devolution of  power and the gradual induration of  a state 
apparatus distraught by the campaign against corruption.5 A

As it was probed by its population and the international community, the CCP quickly C
reacted by conducting several informational operations simultaneously, some carry- T
ing a positive message (championing its management of  the crisis and, as such, its polit- I
ical model) and others with a negative narrative (attacks against other states, especially O

N
Western states, for their inability to manage the virus, or even for an alleged responsibility in S
its apparition). On this latter point, Beijing circulated a rumor stating that the virus had 
originated in the United States, and not in China. The present case study investigates 
this singular operation. Without any hint to its “true” code name, if  one was ever assigned, 
and because it appears as a sort of  replica of  the KGB-led Infektion Operation in the 
1980s with which the Soviets tried to make people believe that AIDS was US-made, we 
named this operation “Infektion 2.0.”6 The present study focuses on the first phase of  the C

C
O
N We delineated three components in the CCP’s informational war on the coronavi-
C rus, which were deployed simultaneously and are identified here without hierarchy between 
E them. 
P
T
S A. Controlling the hemorrhage 

The Party’s first informational objective was to control narratives internally. At the 
very start of  the crisis, local and, later, central authorities tried to silence the pandemic by 

A jailing whistleblowers like doctor Li Wenliang (李文亮),7 and by imposing a tight control 
C over traditional media outlets and social networks.8 Faced with the evident failure of  this 
T strategy, which probably turned the epidemic into a pandemic, and with the growing dis-
O belief  of  the population – Chinese citizens compared the coronavirus to Chernobyl9 – the 
R
S Party focused on highlighting its efficiency in managing the crisis, thus building a 

more positive narrative on what was happening. Hence, sustaining the regime was the pri-
ority: the CCP-led operation opted to flood Chinese citizens with multiple (and some-
times contradictory) counter-narratives in order to make them doubt its responsibility: 
the Party was presented as a simple victim. 

A
C B. “Turning the stigma over”
T
I
O The second act in this informational strategy relied on the tools of  the Chinese public 
N diplomacy. They tried to demonetize critical voices in Western media that highlighted 
S the Chinese government’s incompetence during the first weeks of  the pandemic. At that 

point, the narrative endorsed by Beijing stressed that, through the adoption of  radical mea-
sures, China had given time for the rest of  the world to get ready for the crisis. China also 
branded itself  as a global savior that provided many countries with medical equipment. The 
use of  icons was fundamental to accompany the construction of  a narrative presenting 
China at the bedside of  the world, as illustrated by the Italian examples below. Hence, the

A similar campaign was observed in several European countries such as Spain11 or Serbia

of  the embassy and consulates relayed ceaselessly the messages of  the Party.13 This PR A

C. Discrediting adversaries

This aspect of  the informational strategy consisted in accusing other countries, 
beginning with the United States, of  being responsible for the sanitary crisis linked 
to the coronavirus.17 China took advantage of  an ideal timing: as the first country hit by 

C
A the virus, it was logically the first country to (presumably) control it. Then, it used a flurry 
S of  tools to propagate a narrative meant to weaken its adversaries. At that point, Europe 
E and North America were busy managing the urgency of  the sanitary crisis and could not 

dedicate resources to counter this narrative with the strength it would have required.

The CCP did not limit itself  to vague insinuations. It put together a robust disinfor- D

American origin to the coronavirus. This Chinese operation reminded us of  the Infektion T

II. The Soviet “Infektion” Operation: a Model for China? N
C
E

Cold War specialists often point to a major difference between Western and Eastern P
T

intelligence services: while the former were primarily tasked with collecting intelligence, S
the latter dedicated a colossal part of  their resources to disinformation, what the Soviets 
called dezinformatsiya, an element of  the larger “active measures” (aktivnyye meropriata).19 Each 
KGB “residency” abroad had officers tasked with those missions. In fact, their internal 
notation was almost exclusively based on their ability to suggest disinformation operations 
taking advantage of  the fault lines in their assigned countries. Moreover, unlike the U.S. sys- A
tem, and more broadly Western countries, where “covert actions” were designed as excep- C
tional, Soviet “active measures” were largely integrated into the foreign policy of  the T

O
USSR.20 All Party organs had to ensure that the operations were successful. R

The “Infektion” Operation (which was apparently named “Denver” by East Germany’s S
intelligence)21 was likely motivated by degrading East-West relations in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s.22 Faced with Reagan’s efforts to exhaust the Soviet regime, Andropov, the 
former head of  the KGB, responded with swollen aggressivity and more “active measures” 
operations. 

Beginning in the 1950s, the Soviets launched large-scale disinformation operations that A
exploited the fear of  chemical and bacteriological weapons that had taken hold of  Western C
public opinions.23 During the 1970s, the field was even more favorable in the United States, T
where the media had revealed biological warfare programs of  the U.S. army, including at I

O
Fort Detrick, in Maryland. When the HIV virus emerged, in the early 1980s, the Soviets N
immediately took the opportunity to launch a disinformation operation to make peo- S
ple believe that the U.S. Army was responsible for AIDS, presented as a biological weapon 
conceived to target African Americans and homosexuals. 

The actual operation began on July 17, 1983, with a letter published in the Indian 
newspaper The Patriot, created in 1962 by the KGB to propagate fake information use-
ful to the USSR’s interests.24 The document was signed by an anonymous U.S. scientist but

T
I For two years, there was no particular development in this operation, until September 
O
N 1985 when the KGB instructed Eastern European services to propagate the fake 

information published in The Patriot.25 In October 1985, the KGB organized the reproduc-
tion of  the article from The Patriot in a Moscow newspaper it controlled, the Literaturnaya 

C Gazeta.
O In August 1986, the operation took another turn with the Stasi’s involvement, including 
N its Division X, in charge of  disinformation. During the Summit of  Non-Aligned Countries, 
C
E German intelligence services circulated an article written by two biologists, Jakob and Lili 
P Segal, untitled “AIDS: Its Nature and Origin.” This article offered a scientific basis to 
T allegations initially published in The Patriot. For months, these arguments were relayed 
S ceaselessly by Soviet and foreign media (newspapers, magazines, radios, TV channels) and 

the couple of  biologists was introduced as French scientists. This was how the operation 
got traction: hundreds of  newspapers, many of  them without any tie to the Soviet 
Union, covered the narrative fabricated by the KGB, sometimes including information 
that was not in the original document. For instance, several articles insisted that AIDS was 

A
C the result of  a plot whereas others described it as an accident in U.S. research on biological 
T weapons. The “theory” continued to spread and found additional relays in the U.S. 
O radical Left. The Covert Action Information Bulletin, which investigated U.S. covert operations, 
R
S covered the Soviet story and contributed to its prevalence among the U.S. Left.26 On March 

30, 1987, the narrative fabricated by the KGB reached the primetime show hosted 
by Dan Rather on CBS News, which gave another considerable breath of  fresh air to the 
operation. 

The Soviet campaign had an immense impact, especially in Africa and in certain 
segments of  the U.S. population where the theory continues to circulate today. In 

A 2005, for instance, the rapper Kanye West mentionned it in his song “Heard ‘EM Say.” 
C
T Nowadays, this is a textbook case which probably inspired the Russians in their dis-
I information campaign targeting vaccines and which now seems to feed the Chinese 
O approach on disinformation.
N
S In a series of  investigative reports published in The New York Times in 2018, Adam B. 

Ellick, Adam Westbrook and Jonah M. Kessel tried to reconstruct the Soviet methodol-
ogy of  disinformation.27 They identified a seven-step process: 

• Primo, identify weaknesses in the target country, dissents or fault lines that could be 
accentuated and exploited by the Soviet Union. 
• Secundo, create a lie so big that no one could figure out that it was fabricated. 

C
A • Tertio, add a portion of  truth to the lie to make the entire message more believable.

III. Chronology of  the Operation “Infektion 2.0” C

T
O

Contrary to a Soviet operation that lasts several years, the Chinese operation was R
rolled out in a month in 2020, thanks to social media. Not unlike the Soviets, the S
Chinese reacted rapidly to a virus that they had not anticipated: HIV, like the Covid-19, 
are phenomenon that provided these countries’ agents with an opportunity to target their 
adversaries with disinformation. As it happens, with the coronavirus, the Russians – not 
the Chinese – were the first to react: on January 20, 2020, a TV channel funded by the 
Russian Ministry of  Defense, Zvezda, was the first media to describe the virus as a U.S. A
biological weapon, during an interview with Igor Nikulin, an “expert” that often appears C
on propaganda TV channels.30 He was previously known for denying Bashar al-Assad’s use T
of  chemical weapons in Syria,31 and for accusing Americans of  using biological weapons I

O
for instance.32 Meanwhile, in China, when a resident of  Inner Mongolia circulated the same N
story on the app Kuaishou six days later (a video viewed 14,000 times), he was charged with S
spreading rumors and detained for ten days.33 And yet, Chinese diplomats and media were 
spreading that same rumor a month later. In the meantime, Beijing came to understand 
that there was an opportunity following the “intense internal criticisms” that the CCP 
had to face for its management of  the crisis,34 and which was taken up globally, including 
in the United States. On the defensive, the Party-State reacted by diverting the atten-
tion, accusing Washington of  being responsible for the pandemic. Strictly speaking, the C

After this date, the narrative of  a U.S involvement in the creation of  the Covid- A
19 became less prominently relayed – although it did not disappear. The Chinese C

T
Communist Party then adopted a new narrative that presented China as the country that O
managed to fight the virus efficiently. It encouraged others to adopt the same methods, R
while several voices stressed that the nature of  the regime was intimately linked to China’s S

success in managing the sanitary crisis. 
Hitherto, the narrative portraying the United States as responsible for the emer-

gence of  the Covid-19 – either as a voluntary aggression or as an involuntary acci-
dent – circulated rapidly in Chinese diasporas, especially in France and Italy, where the 
theories have been abundantly relayed. Two ideas seemed to be recurring: the virus was A
presented as a revenge for the discriminations and racism to which the Chinese were sub- C

T
jected at the start of  the pandemic; and the fact that an American origin of  the virus made I
it easier to explain why the virus kept circulating elsewhere, in France and Italy especially, O
when China was able to control its circulation. N

This is probably the reason why the narrative of  a U.S. virus was essentially cir- S

culating on WeChat. A WeChat account managed by journalists from the Global Times 
continued to defend the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus may have escaped from a 
laboratory of  the U.S. Army in Fort Detrick. One article covered the history of  the labo-
ratory and suggested that it was both highly secretive in its research on biological weapons 
and badly regulated.51 Besides, the articles posted on WeChat were also very critical of  the 
U.S. system. Xiakedao (侠客岛), the WeChat account of  the Renmin Ribao – whom we C

C University of  Ottawa close to Thierry Meyssan and a regular guest on the Russian channel 
T RT.55 The CRG is famous for its active role in the “conspirasphere” (its articles are, 
O for example, taken up on Le Grand Soir, a militant newspaper of  “alternative information” 
R
S administered by Maxime Vivas, mentioned in the previous part → p. 335) and as a relay 

of  Russian campaigns of  disinformation. In fact, its activities have drawn the attention of  
NATO.56 CRG’s English website is visited by a million visitors each month (1.59 million in 
February 2020) and the French version by more than 100,000 visitors (113,000 in February 
2020).57 Its articles adopy the method used by some Russian media outlets: instrumental-
izing and hijacking neutral voices and serious outlets to deliver a message that reinforces 

A
C their own narrative. 
T One of  the two articles written by Larry Romanoff  relied on a report presumably pub-
I lished by Asahi TV in Japan. It also quoted Shen Yi (沈逸), a professor of  international 
O relations at Fudan University, in Shanghai and, more importantly, a Taiwanese virologist 
N
S that intervened in Zhe ! Bushi xinwen (這! 不是新聞)58 (This! This is not information), a TV 

show aired on the Taiwanese channel EBC Dongsen Financial News (東森財經新聞台), an 
emanation of  the Eastern Broadcasting Company (東森電視), formerly known as Eastern 
Television (ETTV).59

Using three different sources, including two that were not expected to be partial because 
coming from “adversaries” of  China (a Taiwanese virologist and a Japanese TV show), Larry 

C Romanoff  hoped to bring some objective veneer to his words. In reality, it was only an illu-
A sion. First, no link to the Japanese TV show was given; only to an article of  the Chinese Global

not the Japanese report. Then, without assessing the argumentation of  the Taiwanese virol- C

should be noted that ETTV was already known for its pro-Guomindang (KMT) and pro-Bei-

The author of  the articles, Larry Romanoff, introduced himself  as a former consultant S
and current professor at Fudan University, in Shanghai, the city where he supposedly lives. 
He mentioned only one way to contact him: an email address on the Chinese messaging 
service QQ (2186604556@qq.com). His first article was published on globalresearch.ca on 
September 24, 2019, in which he described the Tian’anmen events as a U.S. attempt at pro-
moting a color revolution in China. He wrote 72 articles in six months, all tainted with A
conspiracy theory, and, after late January 2020, almost all of  them dealt with the coro- C

T
navirus. Even though they are not academic articles, this was still an important activity. O

Investigating Larry Romanoff ’s background provided few results. Matthew Brown, jour- R
nalist at USA Today, tried to contact Romanoff  to obtain more details on some elements S
mentioned in his articles, but without success.60 Larry Romanoff  could not be reached. 
Moreover, there is no recent photo of  him. The Russian Pravda, which published six of  
his articles between January 9 and March 9, 2021, illustrated his biography with a photo… 
of  Ernest Hemingway.61

I One can assume, as the Wall Street Journal does, that this “Larry” Romanoff  of  2001 is 
O
N the “Lawrence Delvin” Romanoff who left another trail in the same Calgary Herald three 

years earlier. A 1998 article reported that he was arrested in 1995 for trafficking in used 
stamps that he cleaned and resold for new.76 At his trial three years later, he pleaded guilty 

C but also good faith, explaining that he had tried to raise funds for his church, and produc-
O ing a letter of  thanks that Mother Teresa had personally sent him in April 1995. The article 
N presented him as 55 years old and owner of  a small advertising agency.

E If  this is indeed the same person (who would therefore be 58 years old in the photo 
P above), it would mean that he quickly reoriented his carrer after his 1998 trial, since his 
T company Treasures of  the Orient Inc. was created the following year. The Alberta Business 
S Registry indicates that Treasures of  the Orient Inc. was registered in September 1999 

and deregistered in 2005.77

from Calgary to Shanghai:

critical of  the Chinese policy of  the Prime Minister Stephen Harper.80

Thus began the second life of  bearcanada.com, which was a transitional phase: between 
2006 and 2009, the site was essentially an empty shell, with only the home page changed. 
It presented a “Canadian business, staffed by Canadians, and resident in Shanghai” that 
offered “a variety of  products manufactured in China”.

it is the one that reveals the Larry Romanoff  we know today. In 2010, bearcanada.com,

P The articles were signed 龙信明, which literally means “Larry Romanoff,” as did the 
T header where the same name was indicated on the left. In a section entitled “Shanghai 
S Diary,” the author published photos and comments from his walks around the city. Several 

remarks (about missing Canadian lobsters, comparing climates or prices between Shanghai 
and Calgary, his nephew Eddie in Canada, his return to Canada for Christmas, etc.) leave 
little doubt that the author was indeed Larry Romanoff, the Canadian from Calgary. He 
published a very large number of  articles, on a wide variety of  subjects. This version of  

A
C the site was active between 2010 and 2013: publications were less frequent in 2013, the 
T site stopped evolving from July 2013 and disappeared between May and December 
O 2014. It has since been offline.
R In 2012-2013, several “alternative” news sites reposted its articles, including 4thme-
S

dia.org, the English version of  the “April Internet” website we mentioned in Part II due 
its links to the CYL (→ p. 77). One of  the most shared articles is a rewriting of  the events 
of  Tian’anmen, which would not at all have happened as the “Western” media described 
it.84 These articles are signed “doctor” or “professor Long Xinming of  Fudan University,” 
presented as the founder and author of  the website bearcanada.com.85 Long Xinming, 龙

A 信明 in Chinese, is the alias that Larry Romanoff  admitted using. He also signed 
C
T “Larry Romanoff  (龙信明)” in 2010 and in 2020.86 The LinkedIn page we mentioned 
I earlier is actually a mix of  the two names (“Larry Long”). The equivalence Larry Romanoff  
O = Long Xinming (龙信明) = founder and author of  boardcanada.com is therefore 
N
S indisputable. 

In addition, the link between the third version of  boardcanada.com (2010-2014) 
and Larry Romanoff ’s current sites, moonofshanghai.com and bluemoonofshang-
hai.com (since 2020), is also established since we find on both his current websites the

Romanoff  did not appear to have used this alias after 2013. Moreover, when Ramesh C

Thakur, former UN Under Secretary General and Vice-Rector of  the UN University, revis- T
I

ited in 2019 the site on which “Long Xinming’s” article on Tian’anmen was published in O
N

2013, he found that ”the author’s name had changed to Bhaiaidil Fiverr, which might 
raise questions about authenticity”.87 The site in question is since inaccessible, and Bhaiaidil 
Fiverr is a unique name, which is not used anywhere else. C

Between 2010 and 2012, Romanoff  was also one of  the contributors to the collective O
blog Hidden Harmonies, created in February 2010, on which he reposted some of  his N
articles. Note that his biographical presentation did not change between 2010 and 2021. C

He did not contribute to Hidden Harmonies for seven years, then came back in March S
2020.88 He was listed as a contributor again, and re-published one of  the two articles on 
the coronavirus originally published on GlobalResearch.ca and relayed by Zhao Lijian on 
March 13.89

In conclusion, while a quick analysis of  Larry Romanoff ’s latest publications 
(2019-2020) could legitimately lead to the belief  that he was “probably a fake blog- A
ger created from scratch by the Chinese to echo their messages,” all of  the above C
makes this hypothesis less credible as the means deployed to create Romanoff ’s “leg- T
end” would be disproportionate to the expected gain.90 Most likely, Larry Romanoff  I

O
exists and is a “useful idiot,” perhaps influenced and mentored by the Party-State. N
However, several elements in his trajectory remain to be clarified: his initial links S
with China (how does a Canadian from Calgary become the North American represen-
tative of  a choir of  Hong Kong children?); his anti-American and anti-Semitic conspir-
acy theories that suddenly emerged in 2010 (had he been developing them for a longer 
period?); and the “gap” of  about six years, between 2013 (the end of  bearcanada.com) 
and 2019 (his debut on GlobalResearch.ca), during which this already prolific author 
seemed to have stopped publishing, at least under his own name as well as under his alias C
Long Xinming (why?). A

C
T
I There is no lack of  possible motives to explain the CCP’s decision to launch such an 
O
N operation, and they were mentioned all through this report: creating a diversion for the 

Chinese population toward an evident scapegoat; offering an indirect contribution 
to the perennity of  the regime; or an easier switch to the narrative presenting China 

C as benevolent by concentrating attacks on the United States. It might also have 
O been an attempt at weakening the democratic model of  government with the narra-
N
C tive on the “good” sanitary governance, and even with the efficient Chinese model of  crisis 
E management that was used in targeting the public of  “soft targets” (Italy, Spain, Serbia…), 
P with important mediatic resources. The operation could also be partly explained by the 
T weakening belief  among the party’s leadership that China needs to maintain good relations 
S

with the United States.
This operation could also be understood as a Chinese retaliation, or a warning 

sent to the United States, following a series of  particularly offensive decisions taken by 
Washington in February: on the 10th, four Chinese soldiers from the 54th research institute 

A were criminally charged for the 2017 Equifax hack (image below);91 Huawei was charged 
C with extorsion on the 13th;92 and Washington decided to label Chinese state media as CCP 
T agents on the 17th.93 It is however impossible to confirm that hypothesis with the informa-
O
R tion at our disposal at the moment, but the proximity of  the events deserved to be noted.

Now, we need to explain the reasons behind the end of  the operation “Infektion 2.0.,” 
or at least behind its reduced intensity. Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian interpreted it as a sign 
of  the adoption of  Russian methods by China.94 With such an interpretation, Cui Tiankai’s 
declarations would thus be motivated by the will to spread contradictory slogans to confuse 

C the enemy. But it might also have been done to appease the United States – which is all the 
A more possible as the CCP could leave the fake information circulating unattended, 
S
E finding its own relays in the conspiracy spheres in Europe and in the United States, or in 

Chinese diasporas.

It is too early to evaluate the efficacity of  an operation the consequences of  which may I

be felt over a few years and through unexpected channels. The future will tell us how the N
belief  in an American origin of  the coronavirus settled in the minds. At the moment, the 
Chinese narrative has seldom been reused, which could be a sign of  resistance in the tar-
geted societies, except perhaps in Chinese diasporas. That said, the operation undeniably C
contributes to the fragilization of  democratic societies by insidiously questioning the O
nature of  their institutions and by attacking the very possibility of  truth, which is the key N

C
to consent in liberal societies. E

T

V. An Undeniable Russification of  Chinese methods
For the authors, this operation is interesting because it confirms the Russification/

sovietization of  Chinese methods of  disinformation. To illustrate this evolution, we 
can simply bring back the seven steps identified earlier by the authors of  The New York A
Times’s article: (→ p. 594): C

T
• Primo, China, like the USSR before, promptly reacted and saw an opportunity for O
concealed disinformation in the Covid-19. R

S
• Secundo, there again, the Soviet method was precisely respected. The idea of  a virus 
created by the U.S. Army and implanted in Wuhan through the World Military Games is 
so difficult to conceive that it could only be true. 
• Tertio, the Chinese lie was built on enough truthful elements to make it credible: the 
speech delivered by Robert Redfield on earlier cases of  Covid-19, the near coincidence A
between the games in Wuhan and the epidemic, the U.S. drill on a similar scenario a C
month before the epidemic, the uncertainty over the exact origin of  the virus and on T

I
its initial transmission by animals, the historical analogy with the Spanish flu. All these O
elements reinforced the plausibility of  the Chinese narrative. N

S
• Quarto, the Chinese hand was largely hidden, at least without a thorough investiga-
tion. Representatives of  the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs relayed elements made public by 
third-party actors. The Party never directly advanced new arguments, and simply relayed 
them – such as the Soviets did. Larry Romanoff  could be perceived as a neutral actor. 
• Quinto, useful idiots were legions: the Taiwanese virologist was one of  them, as were 
Michel Chossudovsky and Larry Romanoff. The WHO could be listed as well as it kept C
defending the Chinese version against all odds. A

S
• Sexto, like the Soviets, China denied any involvement. When the narrative changed, E
after the intervention of  Cui Tiankai on U.S. TV, the Chinese government evoked demo-
cratic processes internal to the party to explain the diverging opinions among diplomats. 
Yet, all this could be seen as a pure construction because the implementation of  the 
operation by Zhao Lijian, a mere diplomat, gave an opportunity for the party to present 
his declarations as an isolated and unofficial position. But it is unimaginable that the C

O
Party left a high-ranking diplomat say such things, for several weeks, without making its N

I

N



I
N
T
R
O
D
U disapproval known. Hence, the narrative advertised by Zhao was validated by Chinese 
C authorities. 
T
I
O • Septimo, this is where China seemed to have kept its distance from the “ideal type” 
N of  the Soviet operation. The Chinese campaign ended too quickly and without enough 

time to assess its reach. It is also impossible to tell what the hopes of  the regime were: 
briefly diverting the Chinese public by weakening an adversary? Forcefully inscribing the 

C possible American creation of  the virus in the minds? Or was it a more “experimental” 
O
N approach to an operation, one that could pave the way for more complex disinformation 
C activities in the future? 
E
P
T Similarly to the Soviets, the Chinese have an integrated vision of  political warfare: “active 
S measures” are routine methods used by the CCP that involve numerous and diverse actors. 

But the exact level of  coordination between these actors remains a question mark. 
Did diplomats act on their own initiative? It seems improbable. The articles published 
during the operation also suggested a common action with the propaganda arms of  the 
Party. 

A Finally, we found that the coronavirus did not simply lead to the implementation of  a 
C Chinese influence operation modeled on the Russian and Soviet operations, but also to

O concurring actions that named the United States as the source of  the virus. For instance, 
R an article published by RT highjacked the words of  Wilbur Ross, the U.S. Secretary of  
S Commerce, to increase the perception that the United States had an economic interest in 

seeing the virus circulate.95 For that reason, the Russian narrative was easily inscribed in 
the Chinese narrative and it provided the latter with a breath of  fresh air by bringing 
it to a larger public. In fact, a possible cooperation between Russian and Chinese actors 
is one of  the questions to which the conclusion of  the present report will try to answer.

SUMMARY OF THE FOURTH PART C
O
N
C
E

Taiwan and Hong Kong are on the frontline of  the “political warfare” waged by Beijing: first P
because they are CCP priorities but also because they are outposts, training grounds, and “R&D T
lab” for Chinese operations – which are later perfected and implemented on other targets world- S
wide. This is not different from how Georgia and Ukraine were useful to Russian operations. 
The first step to widen the circle of  Chinese operations targeted Australia and New Zealand. 
Then, it reached new targets globally, such as Europe and North America (among others). This 
part introduced six case studies: Taiwan, Singapore, Sweden, Canada, an operation that targeted 
Hong Kong protestors in 2009, and another that framed the coronavirus as an American cre- A
ation. C

On Taiwan, Beijing does intervene from the outside: the traditional Chinese media form a T
O

powerful system to disseminate Party propaganda, but they have only limited influence. As the R
Party became aware of  it, new dedicated outlets were created, including VTS, CHBC and Hai- S
feng – all covers for the PLA Base 311. However, most Chinese influence operations use local 
relays, following Lenin who stated that “the easiest way to capture a fortress is from within.” It 
allows the Party-State to hide its tracks and increase the likelihood of  positive results. Among 
these relays are Taiwanese media outlets that are enticed and/or forced to follow Beijing through 
various means (including access to the Chinese market). There are cases of  Taiwanese outlets 
censoring themselves to do business in China for instance. But there are other options: adver- A
tising contracts, equity participations through the purchase of  shares (and sometimes overall C
control of  the company), buyouts by Taiwanese tycoons – as illustrated by the emblematic pur- T

I
chase of  the China Times corporation by Want Want, with clear consequences for its editorial O
line – and additional levers such as clandestine funding, nominations to key positions, or bilateral N
forums. Beijing also relies on private cyber-armies, i.e. groups of  individuals that can be hired to S
wage campaigns for/against something/someone; political parties (the KMT has become less 
central as the Party-State is seeking to diversify its channels, with three small pro-unification par-
ties serving as its relays: the New Party (NP), the Chinese Unification Promotion Party (CUPP) 
and the Home Party (HP)). Politicians are also targeted individually for their possible or proven 
pro-Chinese inclinations and based on their strategic position in the Taiwanese political sphere. 
Among the influencers and other intermediaries used by Beijing, there are groups and personal- C
ities from the cultural and artistic spheres, civic organizations, networks of  Buddhist and Taoist A
temples, business circles, soldiers, YouTubers, discontent citizens, Taiwanese living abroad (in S
mainland China) and Chinese insiders (in Taiwan). E

Besides, Taiwan is also interesting for the numerous cases of  information manipulation that 
have targeted the island, including the Jebi typhoon affair (2018), which caused the death of  a 
man, or the electoral interferences during the municipal elections in November 2018 first, and 
later the presidential and legislative elections in January 2020. Furthermore, agriculture has long 
been an important target for disinformation, and the example of  a Chinese that pretended to C

be a Taiwanese YouTuber showed that language is no longer a sufficient barrier to protect Tai- O
N

wan from Chinese information manipulation operations. Li Jie (2019), the Covid-19 pandemic C
L

(2020), and the bilateral diplomatic relation were additional examples. Finally, there is the case U

R
O
D of  the (permanent threat of) military might: the use of  military drills for psychological warfare 
U
C against Taiwan is also one of  the main levers of  Chinese influence operations – and they have 
T
I increased in recent years.
O In conclusion, the Chinese political war against Taiwan brought some tactical successes 
N inasmuch as it contributed to polarizing the Taiwanese society. But it was a strategic failure 

and even a counterproductive policy: both incentives and punitive measures under Xi Jin-
ping did not produce the expected results. A majority of  the population remains favorable 

C to the president and to the DPP and it has grown more distrustful of  China. In fact, the 
O nationalist sentiment rises: the number of  people that describe themselves as “solely Tai-
N
C wanese” has never been higher (67%). The Hong Kong crisis was no stranger to this, having 
E acted as a powerful deterrent. And the government took a number of  measures to combat 
P interference, especially Chinese interference, which should make influence operations more 
T difficult to conduct in the future. It also reinforced its determination to reduce the country’s 
S dependence on China, insisting on diversifying its economy – especially in the sectors used 

as levers by Beijing (i.e. tourism). In general, the recent increased aggressiveness of  China 
against Taiwan, and against the rest of  the world, has considerably boosted the attractive-
ness of  the island. In a word, Chinese efforts to weaken and isolate Taiwan have had the 
opposite effect.

A
C Hong Kong demonstrators were targeted by informational operations in 2019, which 
T
O were also tied to Taiwan (the same recycled methods and content were apparently adapted: 
R on the one hand, the Hong Kong crisis helped structure the narratives against Taiwan; on the 
S other hand, China seemingly used its Taiwanese allies to intervene in Hong Kong). Most of  

the time, it was political “spamming” meant to flood (local and international) public opinions 
with doctored sensationalist content (i.e. comparing Hong Kong demonstrators to cock-
roaches or jihadist terrorists). To that end, they used social networks with an international 
audience, such as TikTok (censored and instrumentalized by Chinese authorities), but also 
Facebook and Twitter, both banned in China (but patriotic trolls are authorized and even 

A encouraged to “hop” over the “Great Firewall” that is supposed to prevent Chinese Internet 
C users from accessing the non-Chinese cyberspace). Twitter explained that it suppressed ap-
T
I proximately 200,000 fake accounts part of  a “coordinated state-backed operation” aimed at 
O “undermining the legitimacy and political positions of  the protest movement.” The platform 
N also published the archives of  the 936 most active accounts, all originating from the PRC. 
S The data showed that the campaign was launched hurriedly with two traditional types of  ac-

counts, the “mercenary” (bought or stolen) and “dormant” accounts; they spread three main 
narratives: a rejection of  the demonstrators, support for the Hong Kong police, and con-
spiracy theories on the participation of  “Westerners” in the protests. One of  the main clues 
to the “massive and coordinated” but also hurried nature of  the disinformation campaign 
could be found in the dates when the accounts were created: more than half  were created 

C within three months. Our investigation also identified a series of  dormant accounts that had 
A been reactivated, and relaying accounts (used to retweet and share content published by the 
S main accounts). Moreover, it confirmed that the two main arguments justifying the attacks 
E were the alleged violence of  the protestors and their manipulation by “anti-Chinese foreign 

forces.” 
Finally, the Hong Kong example highlighted the importance of  the (relatively) new “corps 

of  volunteers,” or “water armies,” usually used to artificially increase the popularity of  a star or 
product, but that can be refitted in times of  crisis to conduct veritable campaigns of  hatred. Two 

C of  the most famous of  these groups are Diba and Fanquan, and they conducted joint actions 
O
N against Hong Kong demonstrators.

Singapore, which has an ambivalent relationship with China, a mixture of  proximity and D
U

defiance, has a number of  particularities that makes it particularly vulnerable, but at the same C
time particularly resistant, to Chinese influence. The city-state is structurally vulnerable due to its T

I
size, hyperconnectivity, common use of  both English and Chinese, its dependence on imports, O
tense relation to Malaysia and, most importantly, because of  the very multiethnic and inter-com- N

munitarian nature of  the Singaporean society. The country also has vulnerabilities specifically 
attractive to China: a majority of  its population has Chinese roots (74.5%), which encourages 
Beijing to present Singapore as a “Chinese country.” Besides, the population is organized in C
clan associations, faces heightened Chinese immigration and is economically attracted to China. O
Finally, Beijing can rely on mediatic and individual relays, and on a similar approach to human N

C
rights. In this context, Beijing’s goal is to “impose a Chinese identity onto Singapore,” to make E
the city-state stop training its armed forces in Taiwan, stop speaking about freedom of  naviga- P
tion, and further increase its trade relations with China. T

Several events are symptomatic of  the Chinese influence in Singapore and played a part in S
the rapidly rising awareness of  the public: with the Terrex affair culminated a series of  incidents 
in the bilateral relation in 2016, and several spying scandals (including Huang Jing and Jun Wei 
Yeo). 

That said, Singapore is also particularly well-equipped to counter this pressure. Its defense 
relies on the development of  a counter-narrative on a unique national, multiethnic and multi- A
cultural identity, and more specifically on a singular Chinese Singaporean identity. On the paper, C
three-fourth of  the inhabitants are “Chinese” but a large majority of  them describe themselves T
as Singaporean. The cultural penetration of  China is weak. On the other hand, there is a grow- O

R
ing awareness of  the risks posed by Chinese influence, which is catalyzed by a personality like S
Bilahari Kausikan, a former diplomat and secretary of  state, who stated that China “uses a range 
of  tactics--from legitimate diplomacy to more covert and often illegal deployment of  agents of  
influence and operations--to sway decision makers or public opinion leaders.” He believes that 
these operations against Singapore were intended “not just to direct behavior, but to condition 
behavior. China does not just want you to comply with its wishes, it wants you to… do what it 
wants without being told.” Singapore is therefore very aware of  its vulnerabilities. Moreover, in A
the field of  combating information manipulation, Singapore is, along with Sweden, one of  the C
most advanced states in the world. T

Sweden is a typical case of  a “Machiavellian moment.” While the bilateral relationship N
was developing and China’s image was quite good, the appointment of  a new ambassador in S
August 2017 – who became one of  the precursors of  the “wolf  warrior” diplomats – altered 
the situation. Indeed, the ambassador quickly multiplied offensive and threatening declara-
tions, against media outlets for instance. Some Swedish journalists have gone public about 
becoming the victims of  intimidation attempts from Chinese diplomats but also from diverse 
organizations of  Chinese students. This aggressive Chinese drift in Sweden had notable con-
sequences: the Chinese-Swedish relation has considerably deteriorated, Sweden closed all C
its Confucius Institutes, rewrote its “Chinese strategy,” and the city of  Goteborg cancelled A
its twin-city program with Shanghai. Finally, Sweden banned all Chinese (Huawei and ZTE) S
equipment from its ongoing 5G call for tender. Now, approximately 80% of  Swedish citizens E
view China negatively. This is a disastrous track record for the ambassador but what may 
seem incomprehensible from the outside, because blatantly counter-productive, can be ex-
plained in the following way: the goal was to seduce the CCP, not Sweden. And the latter was 
a good “testing ground” for this new strategy of  wolf  warrior diplomats for several reasons: 
the perfect size (small enough not to become a threat, but large enough to be significant, C
at the European-scale at least), a world champion of  liberal and democratic values (which O

N
criticized China’s record on human rights), a competitor in important economic sectors, and, C

finally, a bilateral relation already irritated by a few stories (including the Gui Minhai scandal). L

O
D With Sweden, Beijing sent a warning to other countries, especially in Europe. It was both 
U
C an opportunistic test and one of  the symptoms of  a broader trend that is now widespread 
T
I throughout the world.
O Two affairs in particular were symptomatic of  the lasting pressure Beijing exerts on Stock-
N holm. On the one hand, there is the case of  the Chinese tourists who were presumably vio-

lented by the Swedish police, an accusation instrumentalized by Chinese authorities to raise 
accusations of  human rights violations precisely when the Gui Minhai case reached its apex 

C and to develop a narrative presenting Sweden as a dangerous and decadent society. Soon af-
O ter, a satirical Swedish TV show that drew inspiration from the accident provoked Beijing’s 
N
C ire (cyberattacks, harassment, intimidation). On the other hand, the case of  Anna Lindstedt, 
E described as the “greatest diplomatic scandal in modern Sweden,” involved the Swedish am-
P bassador in China (Anna Lindstedt) and the daughter of  Gui Minhai. Overall, Beijing can 
T rely on numerous local relays in Sweden, such as associations affiliated to the UFWD or the 
S Schiller Institute. 

Several elements in the Swedish case are symptomatic of  a more widespread evolution, ac-
knowledged in the present report, toward a Russification of  Chinese influence operations. Using 
varied narratives focalized on accidents, criminality, immigration, negative stories about Sweden 
to instill the image of  a violent and unstable society is precisely what Russian outlets have been 

A doing for years. Likewise, we note a convergence of  views on Sweden among Chinese and Rus-
C sian authorities and the U.S. alt-right, accompanied by cooperation with Swedish radical move-
T
O ments and parties. Even the choice of  Gui Congyou as ambassador is less surprising that may be 
R thought at first sight: sent to Sweden, where Russia is particularly active, the Chinese ambassador 
S speaks Russian fluently and is a known expert on Russia. As such, this pro-Russian profile makes 

sense if  China means to get closer to Russia, learn from it, and even work with it on the infor-
mational operations that Moscow has long conducted in Sweden. 

Canada has drawn Beijing’s interest for various reasons, none the least for its Chinese diaspo-
ra, which hosts a large number of  proven or presumed dissidents. As in Australia, the Party-State 

A uses its entire repertoire of  actions there. For a long time, and despite recurring CSIS alerts and 
C numerous cases published by the press, political resistance – in this case the propensity to see 
T
I Beijing as a partner rather than a threat – remained strong in Canada. Yet, people have begun to 
O awaken to the problem after 2018, due to several factors: the ripple effect of  the Australian prec-
N edent (the similarity between the two countries prompted comparison) and above all the Huawei 
S affair, i.e., the brutal deterioration of  the bilateral relationship following the arrest in Canada 

of  Huawei’s Chief  Financial Officer at the request of  U.S. courts, to which Beijing immediately 
responded by arresting two Canadians on its soil, without any justification (hostage diplomacy), 
and by adopting trade sanctions. 

One of  the main goals for Chinese operations in Canada is to quiet dissidents. There are 
many well-documented cases of  harassment and intimidation of  citizens and residents con-

C sidered as dissidents or threats by Beijing. Beijing organizes (via WeChat usually) aggressive 
A counter-demonstrations, conducts harassment and intimidation campaigns against targeted 
S individuals, helped by fake accounts and doctored images, uses relatives and family mem-
E bers who stayed in China as levers. Besides, the country constantly monitors certain com-

munities, most prominently ethnic minorities (including Uyghurs), conducts cyberattacks 
against dissident groups and individuals, and usurps identities (attackers, for instance, sent 
insulting emails to ministers and MPs pretending to be Falun Gong members to discredit 
them). It also implements travel restrictions (Canadian activists were denied visas to China, 

C were arrested, detained, intimidated at Chinese airports, and forced to leave the country). 
O
N In any case, the goal remains the same: to censor dissenting voices. Beijing’s representatives 
C abroad, including its ambassador and consuls in Canada, are directly implicated in some 
L
U intimidation campaigns.

Furthermore, Beijing also tries to influence: D
U

- Canadian politics, by approaching and coopting certain politicians (some MPs and ministers C
at the federal level but most prominently local politicians, in British Columbia and Ontario T

I
especially, where the largest communities of  Chinese live). There were a few cases of  electoral O
interference too: the Chinese consulate in Toronto sent Chinese students to Chinese-speaking N

homes to tell voters whom to vote for, and the consulate in Vancouver is regularly accused of  
endorsing candidates of  Chinese descent in the Richmond district, where a Chinese organization 
once incited voters – via WeChat – to vote for specific candidates in exchange for money. C

- Media outlets: almost all Canadian outlets in Chinese are controlled by the CCP, and the O
Party-State uses both the carrot (encouraging newspapers to censor themselves in exchange of  N

C
trade advantages) and the stick (intimidation, threats, harassment, pressures on relatives in China, E
ousting journalists who resist pressure, closing dissenting programs) against them. There were P
also cases of  information manipulation, especially through doctored translations. T

- The educational system: in the universities first, including some that are relatively dependent S
on Chinese students (like in Australia, but less prominently). Two types of  problems need to be 
considered separately: on the one hand, Beijing uses Canadian university programs in science 
and technology to spy and steal technologies; and Canadian academics take part to dozens of  
research projects with Chinese military universities. On the other hand, Beijing uses Canadian 
universities to political ends, monitoring what is being said on campuses and surveilling the A
dissidents that speak up. Some organizations have adopted a near-military discipline, sometimes C
raising the flag and singing the Chinese national anthem on Canadian campuses, where Chinese T
students do not hide their nationalism. There is also evidence of  the involvement of  Chinese O

R
authorities (embassies and consulates) on Canadian campuses, especially through student asso- S
ciations (CSSAs). Then, secondary education has not been left untouched – with the opening 
of  Confucius Institutes especially. In that context, there are examples of  restrictions of  the 
students’ freedom of  speech, on topics tied to China: some teachers forbade discussions of  the 
Tian’anmen massacre and used maps that included Taiwan in China for instance. 

Furthermore, there are cases of  information manipulation, including forged letters sent on 
behalf  of  the prime minister and minister of  immigration in favor of  a new “Tibetan” orga- A
nization that was nothing but a façade used by Beijing to circulate its narrative on Tibet. Also, C
WeChat is regularly criticized for its role in controlling persons and contents on campuses, or- T

I
ganizing public counter-demonstrations, and in interfering with the electoral process. Chinese O
services have used WeChat groups abroad to detect dissidents and harvest personal data. In one N
case, the WeChat account of  a Liberal minister was used against her will to collect money meant S
to fund legal pursuits against a journalist critical of  Beijing. 

In Canada, the Party-State relies on hundreds of  local organizations that are more or less af-
filiated to the UFWD (hence to the CCP). Each year, new organizations are created, in all areas 
of  life. Besides, Beijing is engaged in a strategy to seduce the First Nations, which may be used 
to divide the Canadian society (with the narrative that “the two people must help each other to 
fight marginalization and racism”). The example of  the Musqueam, an autochthonous people C
from the Vancouver region, is particularly interesting as some have Chinese ancestors. Hence, A
Beijing’s efforts toward them are significant, but they are not the only targets. S

Finally, as in the Swedish case, the Canadian example testifies to the Russification of  Chi- E
nese influence operations. First, the Party-State does not stop at shaping the national debate on 
China, censoring dissidents, the press, interfering in schools and universities, and so on. It also 
criticizes the Canadian society and its government to try to divide the population. It exploits 
several potentially divisive topics to alienate the Chinese community from its host country and, 
ultimately, convince them that they are closer to Beijing than to Ottawa. The Huawei scandal also C
provided Beijing with the opportunity to stir tensions between Canada and the United States, O

N
circulating the idea that, contrary to appearances, it was really a problem between Canada and C

the United States, not Canada and China; that Canada found itself  inadvertently in the middle of  L

O
D a Chinese-American cold war. Now, Chinese operations remain tied to the Chinese community 
U
C in Canada, but their progressive Russification indicates that they are increasingly “de-Sinicized,” 
T
I i.e. they have widened their reach from strictly communitarian questions to addressing societal 
O issues that affect all Canadians. 
N

The last case study discussed the operation meant to redefine the coronavirus as U.S.-
made. The informational war launched by the CCP on the coronavirus had three components: 

C controlling the hemorrhage internally (emphasizing its efficient management of  the crisis, and 
O flooding Chinese citizens with multiples, sometimes contradictory, counter-narratives); turning 
N
C the stigma over (demonetizing the critical voices heard in Western media and building a narra-
E tive presenting China at the bedside of  the world – even when it implied manipulating facts and 
P information, such as in Italy); and discrediting adversaries (blaming the sanitary crisis on other 
T countries, especially on the United States). There lied the operation we nicknamed “Infektion 
S 2.0,” for its similitudes with the KGB’s Infektion Operation conducted during the 1980s to make 

people believe that Americans had created the AIDS virus. 
The Chinese operation was deployed considerably faster in 2020, in a month (four years for 

its Soviet version, between 1983 and 1987 – a difference due to the virality of  social networks). 
Early on, the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs was involved, relaying the theory that the virus 

A originated in the United States, not in China. It drew on the Canadian website globalresearch.
C ca (known for its active role in the “conspirasphere” and as a relay of  Russian campaigns of  
T
O disinformation) and on the articles published by “Larry Romanoff,” a retired Canadian settled 
R in Shanghai.
S Beijing’s motivations may have been diverse: diverting the attention of  the Chinese popula-

tion to an evident scapegoat; then contributing indirectly to the perennity of  the regime; helping 
out the switch to a narrative that presented China as benevolent by disparaging the United States; 
weakening the democratic model of  governance by circulating the narrative of  a “good” Chinese 
management of  the sanitary crisis, etc. This operation successfully confirmed the Russification/
sovietization of  Chinese methods of  disinformation as they followed, almost to the letter, the 

A steps of  the KGB’s operations: a prompt reaction; a story so difficult to conceive that it could 
C only be true; based on enough truthful evidence to be believable; in which China’s role was hid-
T
I den; with the help of  some useful idiots. Lastly, like the Soviets, Beijing denied any involvement.

CONCLUSION  C
O

A MACHIAVELLIAN MOMENT N
C
E
P

In the 17th chapter of  The Prince (1532), Machiavel asked “whether it is better to be loved T
S

than to be feared or the contrary,” to which he answered that “it is much safer to be feared 
than to be loved.”1 This posture has most famously been associated with Russia – partic-
ularly with President Putin2 – rather than with China. For a long time, it was said that 
China tried to be loved rather than to be feared: the country wanted to seduce, to proj-
ect a positive image of  itself  onto the world, and to provoke admiration. We did write, in an A
article comparing China and Russia in January 2020, that “China is more preoccupied with C
its moral image (respectability) on the international stage, being a good global citizen,” and T

O
that it was, as such, “more reluctant to use certain methods potentially presenting a greater R
reputational risk.” Russia, on the other hand, “not only cares less about its reputation (it S
has less to offer but also less to lose), it actually cultivates the image of  a strong state using 
security and military with audacity”3 to denigrate its adversaries and impair their power of  
attraction. This is at least the Russian interpretation of  the soft power (мягкая сила).4 Now, 
the difference between China and Russia has become thinner. 

Obviously, China has not renounced its strategy of  “seducing and subjugating” A
(→ p. 147), its attractiveness, or its ambition to model international norms. The CCP C
remains careful not to “lose face” (丢脸-丢面子) and to avoid damaging its image in many T
domains. For that reason, the Chinese ethos has not become Russian. However, at the same I

O
time, Beijing is more and more comfortable with “infiltrating and constraining” N
(→ p. 161). Undeniably, as shown in the hundreds of  pages in this report, its influence S
operations have grown considerably tougher in recent years, and they have come to 
resemble Moscow’s more and more closely. The reasons behind the aggressive turn of  
Chinese diplomacy (which started before the Covid-19 pandemic) are revealing: ambassa-
dors are now primarily targeting Beijing, they are in a zealous race to win favors (→ p. 239). 
For Beijing, defending the Party has become more important than winning the hearts 
and minds of  foreign populations which, in any case, are already constrained by China’s C

O
N entered, since 2017 or so, into a “Machiavellian moment”5, the main symptom of  

which is the increasing Russification of  Chinese operations. 

C
O
N I. The Russification of  Chinese influence operations 
C
E Despite their common ideological matrix, significant skills transfers from the USSR 
P
T to Maoist China (at least until the early 1950s), and jointly-led operations,6 China’s 
S informational strategies have long remained different from its vast neighbor’s. For 

instance, Beijing has always seemed to cherish its international image, which meant usu-
ally (but not always) opting for the diffusion of  positive messages about itself  – whereas 
Moscow took on the image of  the spoilsport, stirring up social, political, ethnic, or reli-
gious conflicts in targeted countries. Furthermore, Beijing’s operations mostly focused 

A on Chinese diasporas throughout the world whereas Russia had more general and diverse 
C targets. Finally, and that was the major difference for the past twenty years, the PRC’s 
T
O power allowed it to wield its influence without having to systematically use secret opera-
R tions, while Russia’s endemic weakness renders the asymmetric weapon of  informational 
S operations more necessary. 

Yet, we suggested in January 20207 that a Russification of  Chinese operations was 
underway. It wasn’t a novel idea: the Russification of  Chinese operations – or at least bor-
rowings from Russian tactics – has been discussed for years. A parallel was drawn, for 
instance, during the 2018 municipal elections in Taiwan, which were targeted by “a 

A Russia-style influence campaign.”8 At the time, it already alerted some observers; in the 
C columns of  The Washington Post, for instance, Josh Rogin wrote a premonitory assessment: 
T “the fact that Beijing is using Russian-style political interference tools should prompt a 
I
O full-scale national security alarm. The capabilities Beijing is honing in Taiwan could do 
N huge damage if  applied to the United States. China is testing them on a country it knows 
S well but preparing for their use around the world.”9 Indeed, Beijing had tested tactics in its 

regional environment before it began implementing them globally (→ p. 626), exactly what 
Moscow had done a few years earlier. In 2019, this assessment was updated, and the 
fears renewed, during the operations that targeted Hong Kong. And this is in 2020, 
during the Covid-19 pandemic, that the world finally took notice of  the problem. 

Initially, Chinese media outlets covered the pandemic in a rather positive manner, in 
C that it highlighted Chinese efforts. Then, as Western countries were affected and China 
A
S increasingly blamed, they adopted a more offensive stance that integrated a negative cov-

erage of  the management of  the crisis by other countries. Hence, comparing models, it D
U

used the pandemic as an illustration of  the apparently chaotic and inefficient democratic C

model of  government. While using different tactics (“from promoting conspiracy web- T
I

sites to the use of  trolls and bot networks to pushing false narratives couched in science O
N

on Chinese state media”), “Beijing [engaged] in an aggressive information campaign 
to try and reshape the global narrative around COVID. [It did] this in attempt to 
make the world see China as the global leader in the response rather than the source of  C
the pandemic.”10 O

The tactics employed by the Chinese government in these successive episodes N
– coordination between diplomats and state media, use of  Western social networks, sys- C

E
tematic attempt to discredit Western media, cooptation of  conspiracy outlets, clandestine P
operations on social networks etc. – led the ASPI to write that “the CCP’s propaganda T
apparatus has been watching the tactics and impact of  Russian disinformation.”11 S

The Global Engagement Center of  the U.S. State Department noted the same thing: “we’re 
seeing the CCP adopt Russian-style tactics.”12 And a growing number of  publications from 
all over the world have stressed it: the Russification of  Chinese operations is now 
widely recognized. 

That said, discussing the “Russification” of  Chinese operations does not imply that A
C

there is one coherent and homogenous Russian approach. With Camille François, we T
can regret that observers are too quick in recognizing a “Russian playbook” when it “is akin O
to a Russian salad: not very Russian, and with different ingredients every time.”13 Russian R

S
actors are actually diverse and not all tied to state structures; they experiment and adapt 
themselves along the way, keeping and improving the recipes that worked. Ultimately, they 
are certainly not the only ones using those tactics. And yet, these are often described and 
investigated – rightly or wrongly – as being “Russians.” 

Concretely, the Russification of  Chinese operations accounts for three elements that 
are described in the following pages: Beijing draws from Moscow in several ways, but A
differences remain between them. Interestingly, there is also a degree of  coopera- C

For attentive observers of  influence operations, it is now evident that “China has been 
studying Russian activities for quite a number of  years and learning from its experiences. 
They are getting better than the Russians in many ways.”14 The PLA, for instance, explicitly 
endorsed this “model”.15

T For the PLA: Russia is a model to emulate
I
O For its experience manipulating social networks, at least since the annexation of  
N Crimea in 2014 (closely followed in China, by the PLA notably), Russia “provided China 

with a model to emulate.”16 In 2014, a member of  the PLA General Staff  Department 
wrote an article drawing three lessons from the “war on [the Russian] public opinion” 

C in Ukraine:17 “take the offensive by pushing your narrative first, present legal argu-
O ments, and back it up with hard power”18 Several similar articles were published after-
N ward, which testified to a clear willingness, on the part of  the Chinese military, to learn 
C from the Russian precedent.19

E In 2018, an article investigating RT’s coverage of  the American bombings in Syria recom-
P mended an “investigation of  RT’s communication methods [:] without losing its ‘objectiv-
T ity,’ we can silently influence the emotions and inclinations of  the public and make it more 
S dependent on information from our media outlets.”20 RT has regularly been quoted as a 

model to emulate in publications of  the Chinese military, especially for its activities on 
social networks. Indeed, analysts from the PLA National Defense University compared the 
Russian channel to “a propaganda aircraft carrier,” stressing its performance on YouTube.21 
Another article published in 2018 insisted on “RT’s value for disinformation, reflecting a shift 
in the PLA’s discussion of  offensive uses of  social media.”22-23 Actually, it was the first “pos-
itive and detailed evaluation”24 of  the Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential 

A campaign. The article highlighted how “Russia’s bots improved the effectiveness and lowered 
C the costs of  propaganda, and that RT spread disinformation on social media to confuse peo-
T ple.”25 Several months later, another article showed admiration for the way RT exploited 
O divisions within Western societies, suggesting China should do the same: “we can also 
R make full use of  the latent contradictions between different countries and the influence of  op-
S position factions within Western countries to prevent enemies from coming together to form 

an anti-China front, and to emphasize how its interminable conflicts and difficulty in reaching 
consensus contrast with our unity.”26

Before assessing to what extent Moscow might have inspired Beijing, we need to empha- D
U

size that they have mutually inspired each other. On some elements, Moscow is actu- C

ally taking cues from Beijing. This is the case, for instance, of  the policies targeting the T
I

diaspora. “The second-biggest diaspora in the world, after the Chinese,”27 is the Russian, O
N

and they both adopted a similarly wide and homogenous conception of  the diaspora. 
Indeed, the manner Beijing conceives “overseas Chinese,” both its nationals but also peo-
ple of  Chinese descent whatever their citizenship may be (ethnic nationalism → p. 165), C
is similar to the way Russia perceives its “compatriots abroad”: not solely the Russians O
strictly speaking, but also Russian speakers that share a common history and culture. As N
Mikhail Suslov noted, “the Russian diaspora is not a diaspora in the strict sense, and nor is C

E
it ‘Russian.’ This ‘Russian’ diaspora is in fact a post-Soviet diaspora, its homeland no longer P
in existence.”28 In both cases, the extension of  the “subjects” over which these states claim, T
if  not sovereignty, at least some form of  control, is very broad. They also tend to conceive S

these diasporas as a homogeneous bloc, which is obviously not the case, primarily because 
they include a significant proportion of  dissidents. In any case, the regimes try to homog-
enize them, with varying degrees of  effectiveness. In that case, Russia is actually doing 
less well than China. Indeed, “the Russian political elite has been aware of  the potential 
of  the ‘Russian compatriots,’ but at the same time its ways of  relating to them are awkward A

C
and confusing.”29 Here, Russia is the one taking heeds from China, as the president of  the T
French Coordination Council of  Russian Compatriots admitted.30 O

Now, Beijing emulates the Russians in a number of  ways:
• 1) In leading clandestine informational operations on Western social networks 
(Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube), using trolls, fake accounts, and bots. Freedom House 
noted that one of  the main evolutions of  the Chinese informational operations 
since 2017 has been the development of  “Russian-style social media disinforma-
tion campaigns.”31 They seemingly debuted “as early as mid-2017” (the earliest such A

C
operation was presumably launched in April 2017)32 and grew more intense in 2019 when T
the Chinese government extended those methods to Western platforms: “[until] the 2019 I
protests in Hong Kong, most evidence of  Chinese computational propaganda occurred O

N
on domestic platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, and QQ. But China’s new-found interest S
in aggressively using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube should raise concerns for democ-
racies.”33 The 2019 campaign in Hong Kong was a test: “Beijing began experimenting

T
I
O Since 2019 (Hong Kong), and especially 2020 (pandemic), a consensus has emerged 
N to recognize that China is engaged in aggressive and clandestine “Russian-style” 

campaigns. Since 2020, many investigations have shown “that pro-Beijing actors are 
carrying out a whole range of  covert activities in multiple countries and languages. The 

C campaigns aim to spread proven falsehoods, sow societal discord and panic, manip-
O ulate perceptions of  public opinion, or undermine the democratic process.”35 As for 
N
C now, these campaigns have mostly targeted China’s near abroad (Taiwan, Hong 
E Kong), Australia and the United States. From this perspective, Europeans – who are 
P battered by more visible Russian campaigns36 – may still be underestimating the threat 
T
S of  Chinese information manipulations. And yet, it is obvious that, without matching the 

intensity and sophistication of  Russian efforts, China is bound to develop its operations 
targeting Europe or a European country in the informational domain.
• 2) In investing massively, openly, and aggressively in social networks, as illus-
trated by the “Twitterization” of  diplomats participating in the “wolf  warrior diplo-

A macy” – something Russian authorities were already doing. 
C
T • 3) In widening the reach of  warfare beyond the sole diasporas. Traditionally – and 
O this was a classical difference between the approach of  Beijing and Moscow – the United 
R
S Front concentrated its efforts on monitoring and surveilling overseas Chinese in Western 

countries, i.e. suppressing dissidents, constructing the narrative circulated in Chinese-
language media outlets, and mobilizing the largest possible number of  individuals to act 
in conformity with the Party’s interests. However, during the last decade (2010-2020), the 
targets of  the United Front have expanded to include, among others, the non-Chinese 
political, entrepreneurial, media and academic elites of  targeted countries, as noted in 

A the online version of  the People’s Daily: the main targets have been “individuals who are 
C
T representative due to their political influence, economic power, social position, 
I and high academic status, as well leaders of  communities.”37

O
N The extension of  the domain of  struggle is particularly visible in the media landscape, 
S where Beijing has evolved from a focus on international outlets in China and its imme-

diate environment (Hong Kong, Taiwan) ten years ago to an attempt at influencing 
and censoring media outlets everywhere in the world nowadays. It has used, espe-
cially after 2017, “tactics that were once used primarily to co-opt Chinese diaspora 
media and suppress critical coverage in overseas Chinese-language publications are 
now being applied – with some effect – to local mainstream media in various coun-

C tries.”38

• 4) In switching from a positive narrative on itself  to a negative narrative on the D
U

others. Beijing’s objective is no longer solely to promote a positive narrative and to pre- C

vent the circulation of  negative representations on China: in Italy and Serbia during the T
I

pandemic, for instance (→ p. 591), a critical (and, in that case, unwarranted) narrative on O
N

the EU was added. In fact, we observe more and more cases where Beijing is “seeking 
to manipulate conversations even on topics not directly related to China,”39 which 
is a recent development. The Party-State is acting gradually, blurring the line between C
its defensive and offensive objectives.40 It is not always easy to understand when the O
country is defending itself  and when it is being offensive, contrary to the Kremlin, which N
endorses more openly the offensive character of  its operations. In any case, Beijing is C

E
“seeing the need not just to defend its own system publicly but to unleash open criticism P
of  ’western democracy’ through its officials and propaganda machinery rather than con- T
fining this language to internal Party documents and speeches.”41 S

• 5) In trying to divide and sow discord in target countries, as illustrated by the several 
operations launched against the United States, including a campaign of  text messages 
meant to create a panic in March 2020 (→ p. 392). On that matter, “American officials 
said China, borrowing from Russia’s strategies, has been trying to widen political divi- A
sions in the United States.”42 The United States is no exception: other examples in this C
report highlighted how Beijing tried to divide Canada, Europe, South Korea or Japan. In T
trying to seduce discontent individuals, those who believe they have been left on the O

R
sidelines – such as Canadian First Nations (→ p. 583) or separatist movements, in Japan S
for instance (→ p. 401) –, Beijing has adopted a method commonly used by Moscow, 
which has not refrained from endorsing protesters in some countries (the Yellow Vests 
in France for instance).43

In a previous report, we noted that the divisions used by Moscow were not only inter-
nal to a country (to fracture its society) but also external, stirring up tensions between A
neighboring states and allies.44 Several examples in this report showed that Beijing has C
also tried to divide Europe, the transatlantic relation, and the U.S.-Canadian rela- T

I
tionship, among others. O
• 6) In interfering with elections. As noted earlier (→ p. 268), China interfered in at N

S
least a dozen elections in Asia, Australasia, and in North America. In the United States, 
APT31, also known as Zirconium, a group of  hackers backed by the Chinese state, tried 
to penetrate the emails of  the Biden campaign in a manner (fishing) similar to 
the hack that allowed GRU officers to conduct the DNC Leaks operation against

P • 7) In circulating conspiracy theories, via official (diplomatic) channels for instance, 
T
S as was saw during the Covid-19 pandemic. An article published in a PLA magazine in 

2018 suggested that conspiracy theories should be spread out in Western media outlets 
if  China were to be losing the battle for public opinions. According to its author, a stu-
dent from the department of  public opinion warfare at the National Defense University, 
Beijing “should cultivate a group of  media outlets and think tanks having a 

A small ‘grey’ audience to spread lies and create a database of  negative topics and 
C conspiracy theories.”47 Doing so, it should focus more particularly on “targeting the 
T younger Western audiences’ distrust of  mainstream media, politicians, and even val-
O
R ues.”48 Likewise, it could use “official channels to amplify conspiracy theories and to 
S sow doubt about established facts in the context of  major political events […], a tactic 

often used by Moscow.”49 “China’s recent promotion of  known conspiracy websites is 
another move taken from the Russian playbook.”50

• 8) In using its near abroad as a testing ground before launching operations world-
wide: Moscow tested its methods during the color revolutions of  the mid-2000s, in Georgia 

A (2008), and Ukraine (2014), before it turned them against Western democracies. Similarly, 
C Beijing started its operations in Taiwan and Hong Kong before widening their reach glob-
T

The frequent use, on the Chinese side, of  content farms (→ p. 367) that are outsourced

(with its sulfurous reputation) startled observers. The same occurred in France when the D
U

CCP-affiliated People Daily used Damien Viguier to discredit the coverage of  China by Le C

Monde. Viguier, who had been condemned for his denial of  crimes against humanity,52 T
I

is the lawyer of  the far-right ideologist Alain Soral.53 Likewise, Egalité et réconciliation, the O
N

association founded by Alain Soral, relayed the Chinese conspiracy theory according to 
which the coronavirus would have its origin in the American laboratory of  Fort Detrick 
(→ p. 589).54 Last but not least, the Chinese embassy in Paris promoted a book on Uyghurs C
written by the far-left administrator of  a website that has “repeatedly relayed conspiracy O
theories” (→ p. 335).55 Examples elsewhere are legions, such as in Italy where Beijing has N
grown closer to the far-right.56 According to an April 2021 report from the Soufan Center, C

E
as of  March 2020 China was the state actor “most involved in amplifying QAnon P
narratives on Facebook,” ahead of  Russia. Between January 1 and February 28, 2021, T
for example, 58% of  QAnon posts on Facebook would have originated in China, while S

less than half  would have originated in Russia. The report concludes that “China’s goal, 
most likely, is to sow further discord and division among the American population.”57 If  
the precise data is to be taken cautiously, as the methodology of  the report has been ques-
tioned (the exact origin of  the operators of  the Facebook accounts involved are unver-
ifiable except by Facebook itself58) the very involvement of  Chinese state actors in the A

C
amplification of  QAnon stories remains plausible. Facebook, like Twitter and Google, has T
reported manipulations of  Chinese origin on several occasions and, as we have seen, some O
of  these manipulations were indeed aimed at increasing divisions within the U.S. society. R

S
This relatively new tendency is another symptom of  the Russification of  Chinese attitudes 
(and diplomatic practice) as the country no longer refrains from displaying itself  with local 
extremes, something Russia has done for a long time. 
Yet, the motivations are different: in general, people aligning themselves with China 
are motivated by financial gains, more than by a convergence of  views or inter- A
ests; while Russia benefits from a genuine ideological proximity with those groups C
(pro-traditions, pro-sovereignty, anti-European feelings, etc.). That said, China’s conduct T
in the Xinjiang – putting a million Muslims in concentration camps as part of  an ethnic I

O
cleansing or even genocide – may seduce some far-right fringes. N
Some anti-Semitic signals in the Chinese discourse must probably be interpreted in S

the context of  this rapprochement with the political extremes. Not only some of  the 
relays of  this discourse have been notoriously conspiratorial and anti-Semitic websites, 
such as the one Larry Romanoff  had as early as 2010 (→ p. 608); but some Chinese 
diplomats, journalists and influencers have recently made some disturbing references.

N distract (“If  you’re accused of  something, accuse someone else of  the same thing”68), and 

dismay (“If  you do not like what someone else is planning, scare them off.”).69

C sive disinformation campaigns targeting the divisions of  a society, and also as not 
O having a global field of  intervention (only a regional sphere).70 These two elements 
N were the two missing pieces of  a hybrid arsenal, according to the infographics of  the

S Finally, the Russification may also be partly a Sovietization. In other words, it could 

reach beyond information manipulation on social networks to a return to tradition as a 
way to counter more and more frequent detections (as shown in the exponential growth 
of  reports on Chinese operations). Like the jihadists who use short waves to prevent the 
interception of  their (GSM or satellite) phone communications, the more observers scruti-
nize and denounce Chinese actions on social networks and on the Internet, the more China 

C could be tempted to implement disinformation on other channels. To do that, the reper-
A toire of  actions elaborated by the KGB’s Service A constitutes a precious source of  inspi-
S
E ration for the Chinese preparing influence operations. Bound to grow in the years ahead, 

this tendency is well illustrated by the operation that we named “Infektion 2.0” which subtly 
mixes disinformation on social networks and controlling front organizations.

B. Some differences subsist D
U
C
T

• 1) China has a more complete toolkit, not only because its own platforms (WeChat, I
O

Weibo, TikTok) are used worldwide, while the Russians rely on U.S. platforms (Facebook, N

Twitter, and Instagram), but also because it has real “offline” influence: “China’s online 
activities frequently support offline influence operations that make extensive use of  
in-person networks of  human agents of  influence, overtly attributed state media in C
English and other non-Chinese languages, and ‘grey propaganda’ with less obviously O

N
attributable ties to the mainland. This robust and well-resourced collection of  tools C
should equip China to execute integrated influence operations on a scale that Russia E
cannot match.”71 Generally speaking, Beijing has many more levers than Moscow, in P
particular economic ones. T

S
• 2) China also benefits from a plethoric workforce. “Russians still rely very much 
on bots, so its computers, and zombie computers that are propagating disinformation, 
whereas the Chinese still seem to be using human beings, which means that the content 
can react more quickly to situations. All of  that is probably also augmented by cyborgs, 
so basically the original information is generated by human beings, and then it is spread A
by computer systems, and all that, so to saturate the environment, but one thing is sure, C

T
is that China has a lot more people that can produce disinformation content than Russia O
does.”72 This comparative advantage is however countered by the growing use R
of  artificial intelligence in informational operations, including in the production of  S

content. 
• 3) Still, Russian information manipulations are more sophisticated. The Chinese 
operations that have targeted Western social networks after 2017 are impressive by their 
sheer number but usually hastened and of  poor quality, hence easier to notice. Russians, 
on the contrary, are more meticulous and have a more precise knowledge of  local A

C
media ecosystems and public opinions. Like KGB officers before them, Russians T
“do ethnographic research (IRA operatives toured the United States) and ingratiate I
themselves into the communities they are pretending to be members of  (e.g., Black O

N
Lives Matter activists or Texas secessionists). They put in effort to build relationships S
with influencers, to ensure that authentic influential voices amplify their content.”73 The 
Chinese generally learn languages but not cultures, and they lack of  adaptive 
capacity: “we see young people speaking the language fairly well but showing really 
inappropriate behaviors,” a Swedish interlocutor told us.74 Yet, it appears that in Middle 
Eastern countries (especially in Gulf  states and in Algeria), Chinese diplomats not only 
speak the language quite well – in both its classical and dialectal forms – but also have a C
precise knowledge of  local cultures.75 A

S
• 4) Russia better integrates cyber with the rest: its cyberoperations are conceived E
as parts of  wider campaigns of  influence (such as hack-and-leak). They are used in a 
sequence that brings in intelligence services, but also media outlets, as we have seen over

D the years, especially with the DNC Leaks and the Macron Leaks.76 Beijing, however, seg-
U
C ments its operations (cyber on one side, then the rest): Chinese cyberoperations are 
T
I numerous and sophisticated, but they are not (yet) integrated into wider informa-
O
N tional operations despite knowing that several actors, such the MSS, have come 

to master the entire process. The fusion ultimately looms ahead if  the Russification 
continues. 

C • 5) China still believes in the attractiveness of  its model. As they attack Westerners, 
O Chinese media outlets are still mainly focused on promoting China and its model of  
N
C governance. CGTN and Xinhua do not behave like RT and Sputnik. China talks a lot 
E more about itself  than Russia does: more than 50% of  the content circulated on the 
P YouTube channels of  CGTN and CCTV focus on China, compared to only 4% of  the 
T
S content released on the YouTube channels of  RT America and RT UK dealing with 

Russia.77 RT France’s website does not have a Russian news tab, for example, while that 
of  CGTN Français even places the “China” tab first on its toolbar. In a word, Chinese 
outlets are ego-centered. 
• 6) Consequently, the differences are not playing in China’s favor: Russian media are 

A better implanted in their local ecosystems, their websites receive a lot more vis-
C
T its, and their profiles on social networks more engagement because they deal with 
O French topics in the French context, for instance, and with divisive issues (unemploy-
R ment, demonstrations, crimes, immigration etc.). Chinese platforms, however, usually 
S speak about China in France, which is less interesting to many readers. In other words, 

China stands far above Russia in its artificially high number of  followers on social 
networks but the Russians are more efficient, more convincing. Thus, they have 
comparatively more impact on social networks. It does not seem to be a Chinese pri-
ority however: they want to “demonstrate to superiors total commitment by generating 

A high levels of  activity […] while actual efficacy or impact may be secondary.”78 As such, 
C the disciplinary campaign marshaled by Xi Jinping probably reinforced the propensity 
T
I of  actors on the field to favor quantitative operations at the expense of  real success. 
O Obviously, they may figure that out and make their future operations more subtle, thus 
N less detectable and more influential. 
S

To sum up, Beijing has an advantage in several domains, Moscow in others, and it can 
be said that “China copied Russia’s tactics […]. But it lacks Russia’s skillset.”79 It 
does not mean, however, that one is less dangerous than the others, none the least because 
China’s room for improvement is considerable. Furthermore, we should not confuse the 
whole with the part: the Russian superiority on information manipulation is evident, 

C
A but when we account for all influence operations, the reverse is true. First, Beijing fol-
S lows the same tradition (communist techniques refined all through the 20th century) and the 
E country is on a path to acquire the same expertise, perhaps even a better one in some areas. 

Also, China’s economic might and the attractiveness of  its internal market means that it is 
harder to say no to. Finally, the country is both more subtle and apparently innocuous in

benign, benevolent, and helpful”80 – can apply to the entire effort of  the United Front, and T
I

to most Chinese influence operations. Finally, as Ryan Fedasiuk noted, “if  the past twenty O
N

years are any indication, foreigners should expect the CCP’s influence operations to 
continue growing in size and sophistication.”81 The Party-State learns fast and it can 
enjoy considerable resources at its disposal. C

C. Cooperation C
E
P

The Sino-Russian – or, more accurately, Sino-Soviet – cooperation on informa- T
tion manipulation is not a new phenomenon. When, in 1949-1950, Soviet propaganda S
accused the United States of  testing biological weapons on the Inuit populations of  Alaska, 
this fake information was relayed by Chinese state propaganda, which asserted that the 
United States was then collaborating with the former chief  of  the Japanese program on bio-
logical weapons, and ready to use these weapons against China. In 1952, during the Korean 
War, the Soviets in turn relayed a Chinese and North Korean disinformation campaign A
averring that the United States was conducting a bacteriological war by airlifting insects C

T
infected with microorganisms carrying diseases such as the plague and cholera. Together O
with the Soviets, they doctored the evidence by creating two fake zones of  contamination.82 R

Nowadays, the Sino-Russian relationship is growing stronger. For more than a decade, S
the two powers have continuously come closer as the distance with the United States 
widens. After 2014, the fallout of  the annexation of  Crimea and of  the Donbass War – that 
is, the rupture with Europe – contributed to reinforcing the partnership between Moscow 
and Beijing. More recently, the Covid-19 pandemic gave the impression of  a “united front” 
in defense of  the authoritarian model of  crisis management to counter presumably inef- A
ficient, even chaotic, liberal democracies, as described by the media of  the two countries. C
Although specialists have repeatedly emphasized the fragility, or at least the somewhat arti- T

I
ficial and unsustainable nature of  this profoundly asymmetrical agreement – the gap having O
widened between the two – the fact remains that in the field of  influence operations, and N
more precisely in the informational sub-field, the two powers are undertaking a clear rap- S
prochement. 

• 1) Media cooperation. An annual Russia-China Media Forum debuted in 2015, 
during which dozens of  contracts are signed between media outlets from both coun-
tries. In 2017, Sputnik signed cooperation agreements with Xinhua, the Guangdong

D China Media Group (CMG, controlling CGTN and RCI) signed a strategic coopera-
U

T

O
N also set up a platform to release content translated from Russian or Chinese and pro-

duced by media in each countries (www.sinorusfocus.com). In 2019, agreements were

C content in Spanish and Arabic this time).87 An agreement with Roskomnadzor – the 
O Russian regulatory authority in charge of  media and communications – granted a cable 
N and digital broadcasting license to the Russian version of  CGTN, another type of  
C
E decision made at this event. At the Russian political level, the vice-minister of  Digital 
P Development and Mass Communications, Alexei Voline, seems to be shepherding the 
T negotiations. 
S

Besides, several Chinese journalists are invited every year to the Russian Young 
Leaders program, “Новое поколение” (New Generation), organized by the agency 
Rossotrudnichestvo, in cooperation with Sputnik. These are master classes where RS 
employees train individuals to the “Russian methods of  international journalism pertain-

A ing to media production and social network uses.”88

C
T This rapprochement is motivated by a shared belief  in the competitiveness of  the inter-
O national mediatic field, and in the necessity – for Russian and Chinese outlets – to ally 
R themselves in the face of  Western heavyweights (notably CNN and the BBC) and 
S offer an “alternative” editorial line. During the state visit of  Xi Jinping in Moscow, in July 

2017, RT’s editor-in-chief  Margarita Simonian intervened in front of  both heads of  state 
at the Kremlin: she endorsed the framework of  an “informational war” and asked them 
to increase cooperation between Russian and Chinese outlets to ensure “the survival of  
our resources […] in the face of  the powerful Western mainstream journalism.”89 One 

A RT employee interviewed by the researcher Maxime Audinet in 2015 even admitted that 
C several producers and journalist from CCTV came to observe the editorial meth-
T
I ods of  the Russian channel and the construction of  its pretended “alternative” 
O editorial line, which is both incisive and very offensive toward the West (during the 
N Ukrainian crisis in particular).90

S
In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic provided another reason to call for a deeper coop-
eration between Chinese and Russian media to form a common front against critics. 
For instance, during the 2020 China-Russia Online Media Webinar, which took place 
on December 18, 2020, Niu Yibing, the Deputy-Director of  the Office of  the Central 
Cyberspace Affairs Commission (中央网络安全和信息化委员会), called on Russian 

C and Chinese media to “work together to tell more vivid stories about the fight against 
A the pandemic, jointly fight against attacks and provocations from Western coun-
S tries.”91

A Because Russia and China are largely seen, by the rest of  the world as two of  the largest 
S producers of  disinformation, this announcement provoked many ironic comments. But 
E for attentive observers of  influence operations, it was perceived as an avowed sign of  

cooperation in the field, not to “fight” disinformation, but to produce it. This is 
also suggested by the Chinese use of  narrative materials usually adopted by the Russians.

Thus, after the publication by the Jyllands-Posten of  caricatures of  the PRC flag, Chinese D
U

Internet users (including the Diba group) mocked the “weakness” of  the Danes, who C

were only able to resist the German invasion for 4 hours on 9 April 1940, which is a T
I

recurring argument in Russian disinformation campaigns.100 The presence of  this “refer- O
N

ence” in Chinese campaign makes it possible to suppose that the two countries practice 
transfers of  competences.

Party-State no longer hesitates to keep company with the political extremes (→ p. 626), it O

N
frequently draws from the same sources as Moscow. Most of  its anti-American relays C
are known to be, correlatively, pro-Russian. For example, in order to deny the oppression E
of  Uyghurs, to discredit the German researcher Adrian Zenz,101 or to deny the Chinese ori- P
gin of  the coronavirus, Chinese authorities readily rely on Max Blumenthal, an American T

S
journalist, and his site The Grayzone, which are cited by the Chinese press as well as by 
the spokespersons of  the Foreign Ministry.102-103 An article by Blumenthal published in The 
Grayzone on February 18, 2021 was relayed on Twitter by Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the 
Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, by CGTN, which gave an interview to Blumenthal for the 
occasion, and by a number of  embassies. Some even reproduced the article in its entirety A
on their websites.104 However, Blumenthal, who founded his site one month after a trip to C
Moscow for the tenth anniversary of  RT, was until then known mainly for being a relay of  T
Russian propaganda (and an advocate for Bashar al-Assad).105 His site The Grayzone was O

R
also cited by the spokeswoman of  the Russian Foreign Ministry.106 He is now one of  the S
many common sources of  Beijing and Moscow.
• 5) Cooperation between security services? We can suppose – without concrete 
evidence however – that media outlets and diplomats from both countries are not the 
only ones cooperating on influence operations (which they call operations of  count-
er-influence) and that their armed forces and intelligences services, for instance, are A
also exchanging information, and perhaps “good practices,” when their common objec- C
tive is to weaken and divide liberal democracies. It is all the more logical to assume it T

D Cooperation Organization (tasked with fighting terrorist threats and illegal drug traffick-
U
C ing for instance). What is certain, as the Chinese military publications demonstrate, is 
T
I that there is at least a Chinese interest in Russian tactics and, as the Chinese grow more 
O
N powerful, probably a reciprocal interest on the Russian side for Chinese experiences. 

C II. Some Tactical Successes but a Strategic Failure
O
N
C Machiavelli affirmed that “it is much safer to be feared than to be loved.” Yet, having 
E read Cicero,107 he immediately added that “a prince must nevertheless make himself  feared 
P
T in such a way that he will avoid hatred, even if  he does not acquire love; since one can very 
S easily be feared and yet not hated.”108 This is precisely what Beijing has failed to do. 

Chinese influence operations have been met with tactical successes. China is able to 
constrain private companies, such as airlines or hotel chains, to name their destinations dif-
ferently (“Taipei, China”), or the NBA to apologize for the tweet of  a club official. It also 
demonstrated an ability to inflict high financial damages (when it blocked the website of  

A The New York Times in 2012, as a retaliation for an article Chinese authorities did not like, 
C the group’s stock market value fell by 20% in twenty-four hours). Additionally, from fear of  
T
O retributions, many companies refrain from publishing ads in media outlets critical of  China, 
R which impoverishes these outlets. Yet, despite these little victories, the offensive has been a 
S strategic failure. China’s influence in the world has led to a backlash against it that is both 

widespread and growing. 
This is not a new trend: China remains its own best enemy in terms of  influence. It 

can be seen in Africa,109 where China’s image has changed: the honeymoon is over as the 
country is increasingly criticized as predatory– its projects not benefiting local populations 

A – and for being as harmful as colonial powers were. In many places, as in Mali, the popu-
C lations are exasperated, not only by the plundering of  natural resources, particularly gold, 
T
I but also by the working conditions, the illegal entry of  Chinese workers and the pollution 
O it generates. The fact that the leaders, benevolent towards the Chinese presence, generally 
N do not take into account the complaints of  the population on this subject contributes to 
S the distrust of  the elites and the polarization of  societies. The BRI also faced numerous 

setbacks in the past couple of  years, with the same complaints (“Chinese try to take every-
thing they can, without paying attention to the employees or the local companies. They act 
as if  we were a colony. But we won’t let it happen,” according to people working in the port 
of  Piraeus, which was bought by Cosco in 2016).110 The BRI is also “running out of  steam” 
for economic reasons, as Jean-Pierre Cabestan reminds us: “not only because the countries 

C of  the South are finding it increasingly difficult to repay their debts to Chinese state banks, 
A
S but also because Beijing needs more financing to support domestic growth.”111 The reflux is 
E generalized and it had started before the more aggressive turn of  the past couple of  years. 

Now, with its “wolf  warrior” diplomacy, its information manipulations and brutal

methods, Beijing has definitely altered its image. It was a done deal: the CCP could not D
U

become as aggressive as Russia and, at the same time, maintain on the international stage C

the ethos of  a responsible actor peacefully rising. T
I

This is precisely what some in China, more lucid than others, had feared, especially inside O
N

the CICIR, the think tank of  the MSS (the main civilian intelligence agency). In early April 
2020, an internal report from the CICIR, presented to Xi Jinping, affirmed that the pan-
demic could provoke the strongest wave of  anti-Chinese feelings in the world since C
Tian’anmen in 1989, and that it could also feed into the resistance against BRI projects O
and invite Washington to increase its financial and military support to Asian allies – increas- N
ing the risk of  confrontation.112 Meanwhile, Shi Zhan (施展), director of  the World Politics C

E
Research Center at China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing warned that “this ‘wolf  war- P
rior’ diplomacy is unsustainable and risks isolating us.”113 T

Again, this Chinese fall from grace on the international scene is the latest trend of  a down- S

ward evolution that started before the pandemic. Several affairs, including the case of  
espionage against the African Union headquarters, the “hostage diplomacy” used to coerce 
Canada and a growing number of  other countries, the revelations about the concentration 
camps for Uyghurs (“China Cables”)114 and the management of  the Hong Kong crisis have 
all contributed to the deterioration of  Beijing’s image after Xi Jinping came to power. A

C
However, this evolution is relative: it is among the developed economies, especially T

Western states (Europe and North America) and their allies (Japan, South Korea), that China’s O
image has deteriorated significantly. It remains correct, and is even improving in developing R

S
countries. This polarization reflects Beijing’s double discourse, which “plays on confron-
tation with the West and seduction of  the South,”115 in Africa, Latin America and Asia.

D This deterioration has been gradual, but it seems to have accelerated since 2017-2018, 
U
C especially in Australia (→ p. 544) and Sweden (→ p. 521) as noted previously, but also 
T
I in Canada (→ p. 539) and elsewhere in the world. In the United States, the election of  
O
N Donald Trump in 2017 catalyzed an ineluctable confrontation which the president dubbed 

a new “cold war.” Americans now measure the extent of  Chinese influence at home. In 
July 2020, the director of  the FBI explained that “the FBI is opening a new China-related 

C counterintelligence case about every 10 hours.”116 Several months later, Newsweek noted that 
O they had found “600 such groups in the U.S., all in regular touch with and guided by China’s 
N Communist Party – a larger-scale version of  a pattern found in other countries around the 
C
E world.”117 In the United Kingdom, the deterioration of  the relations – after the “golden 
P age” lauded by David Cameron during the 2015 visit of  Xi Jinping in London118 – acceler-
T ated after 2019, first with the crisis in Hong Kong, which was particularly sensitive for the 
S British as they retroceded the former colony to China in 1997, and later with the sanitary 

crisis (London criticized Beijing for its lack of  transparency, the diffusion of  fake news, 
and for the cyberespionage that targeted British laboratories). Also notable was the British 
change of  mind that led to the exclusion of  Huawei from British 5G networks, decided 
in July 2020 (the Chinese embassy described it as an “error” for which the British would 

A
C “pay the consequences”) – a threat that apparently did not dissuade Germany and Romania 
T from also banning Huawei from their future 5G networks in April 2021. On February 
O 4, 2021, OFCOM, the British media regulatory agency, cancelled CGTN’s broadcasting 
R license based on the assessment that CGTN wasn’t the one making the editorial choices for 
S

the channel, but the CCP. This added to the deterioration of  the bilateral relation.119 As in 
the United States, this changing attitude toward China is a bipartisan issue widely endorsed 
by a public opinion increasingly warry of  Beijing. 

In France as well, awareness, although more discrete, is nevertheless palpable, with a 
clear acceleration in the first quarter of  2021 (see below).

O The French Awakening
N As elsewhere, the image of  China has deteriorated in France for the last couple of  
S years, and especially after the appointment of  Ambassador Lu Shaye in Paris (2019), a 

“wolf-warrior diplomat” who contributed to making the embassy more aggressive, especially 
on social networks, as we saw in this report (→ p. 234). The Covid-19 pandemic aggravated 
this tendency because the embassy was on the defensive and multiplied its attacks – such as 
an April 2020 article on the “EHPAD nursing staff ” (who had “abandoned,” “deserted” and 
“left their pensioners to die from hunger and illnesses”), following which the ambassador was 
summoned by the French Minister of  Europe and Foreign Affairs (→ p. 238). 

C Other cases have contributed to mobilizing the French public opinion against Beijing, includ-
A ing the November 2019 revelation that Huawei was suing the researcher Valérie Niquet 
S for libel (→ p. 53); she instantly received many messages of  support. The persecution of  
E Uyghurs, better and better documented, was a powerful accelerator to raise attention on the 

topic – especially thanks to researchers who have been mobilizing for years (in a collective

op-ed in Le Monde in 2018 for instance120), as well as to the commitment of  several politicians, D
including the French MEP Raphaël Glucksmann, who has incidentally become a target of  the U

C
embassy.121 In September 2020, President Macron publicly denounced “unacceptable practic- T
es” in Xinjiang for the first time.122 Meanwhile, a growing number of  investigative reports I
have documented the Chinese power, influence, or espionage – including several issues O

N
and special issues in several French magazines in 2020.123 
The negative view of  China in France can be measured: a poll conducted in October and 
November 2020 showed that “62% of  those polled have a negative or very negative view […] 
regardless of  political affiliation, suggesting that there is a high level of  consensus,” which C
puts China “the second most negatively-perceived country […] just after North Korea, O
and followed by Russia.”124 And several stars have contributed to this awakening, such as the N
football player Antoine Griezmann who, in December 2020, announced he had terminated his C
contract with Huawei, “due to the strong suspicions that [the company] had contributed to the E
development of  a “Uyghur Alert” thanks to a facial recognition software.”125 P
In October 2020, an article by Laurence Defranoux in Libération noted a “change of  tone” T
in France vis-à-vis Beijing. While, “for a long time, in the face of  Beijing’s propaganda and S
attempts at censorship and intimidation, the response in France was muted, if  not non-exis-
tent, as the fear of  economic retaliation was great,” things were visibly beginning to change.126

During the first months of  2021, several elements testified to an acceleration of  the French 
awakening. On January 21, the Ministry of  the Armed Forces published its 2021 Strategic 
Update, updating the 2017 Strategic Review: the document mentioned China not only more 
times than in 2017, but also more than Russia. It also presented the country first and foremost 
as a “strategic rival.”127 Media have also increasingly reported on the growing aggressive- A
ness of  Beijing. And they have broadened their audience, for instance with the 70-minute C
TV documentary “China, the great offensive” broadcast on France 2 on February 25. The T
following day, a long investigation was printed in the weekly Le Point on “how China pushes O
its pawns at the University,”128 which notably charged Christian Mestre, the former president R
of  the University of  Strasbourg, who subsequently resigned his position as ethics officer of  S
the Strasbourg Eurometropolis (→ p. 409).129 On March 18, the same Le Point journalist, 
Jérémy André, the weekly’s correspondent to Hong Kong, published another investigation on 
“[how] Beijing takes advantage of  our researchers.”130 These demonstrations had already been 
common in Australia, in the United States, in Canada and even in the United Kingdom, as we 
showed in this report, but they had never been done with such a level of  details in France.
The persecution of Uyghurs is also more insistently denounced from the printed press – A
which no longer hesitate to discuss “the hidden genocide” on its cover, such as L’Obs did in C
early March131 – to the political class. The Minister of  Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean- T
Yves Le Drian, denounced in several official speeches “the unjustifiable practices used I

discussed and we are ready to consider it.”133

C Finally, a new level was reached when, within a few days (March 15-22), it was revealed 
O that the Embassy of  China had pressured senators to cancel a planned visit to Taiwan 
N and insulted the researcher Antoine Bondaz, who had defended them. The Twitter ac-
C count of  the embassy called him a “small strike,” a “mad hyena”, and an “ideological troll,” 
E leading to a unanimous condemnation and a high diplomatic coverage – a symptomatic ep-
P isode of  the perverse effect (which we labelled the “Bondaz Effect”) of  the “wolf-warrior” 
T diplomacy (→ p. 237). And it did not stop there: at approximately the same moment, Beijing 
S announced sanctions against 10 Europeans, including the French MEP Raphaël Glucksmann, 

in retaliation for sanctions adopted by the EU due to the repression of  Uyghurs. For all these 
reasons (insults and sanctions), the Minister of  Europe and Foreign Affairs summoned the 
Chinese ambassador on March 22 but the latter did not come to the meeting, which pro-
voked the anger of  Clément Beaune, the secretary of  state for European Affairs: “France and 
Europe are no doormats. Someone summoned ought to oblige.”134 When the ambassador 

A finally came to the Quai d’Orsay, the following day, he was received by the director of  the 
C Directorate for Asia and Oceania, Bertrand Lortholary, who told him that “the methods of  the 
T embassy, and the tone of  its public communication, are totally unacceptable and cross the line 
O of  what is commonly deemed acceptable for any diplomatic representation, wherever it may 
R be.”135 This sequence in March 2021 was disastrous for the image of  China in France 
S and contributed to a heightened awareness among politicians and the general public 

of  the unacceptable practices of  Chinese authorities.
A few months later, another sequence drew attention to “Beijing’s offensive against aca-
demic freedom [which] calls for defensive measures,” as diplomat Pierre Buhler explained on 
June 10 in an article denouncing “a disturbing policy of  Beijing, which constitutes a threat to 
higher education and research in democratic countries.”136 Early July, the Senate launched 
an information mission on “extra-European state influences on French universities, 

A the academic world and on their impact,”137 which quickly heard Pierre Buhler and has 
C since questioned a large number of  French and foreign experts, including the authors of  this 
T report.138 The rapporteur is Senator André Gattolin, who is highly invested in the defense 
I of  human rights (having, for example, publicly displayed his support for the demonstrations 
O in Hong Kong in 2019139), co-chair for France of  the Inter-parliamentary alliance on China 
N (IPAC → p. 252) and an excellent authority on China’s influence strategy in France.140 If  the 
S information mission is interested in several countries, the rapporteur believes that China rep-

resents “80% of  the problem.”141 A few weeks later, several articles on “Chinese entryism in 
French universities” published in Libération (July 27, 2021) caused the embassy to react in a

press release accusing, as usual, all critical voices of  racism and confirming Godwin’s law (it D
said it was “revolted” by these articles “which, in a racist tone, publicly incite anti-Chinese and U

C
Sinophobic sentiment […]. It is astonishing to discover that in the 21st century, some people T
still use “Nazi-like” propaganda to advocate this kind of  extreme racism in the media”).142 I
Published on October 5, 2021, the Senate report considers that France is “an important target of  O

N
these operations” and “would benefit from being inspired by foreign examples in raising aware-
ness, or even collaborating with certain states to develop appropriate responses”. This report, 
which was branded as “a first alert to the whole scientific community,” formulates several 
proposals.143 C
Finally, still in the Senate, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defense adopted on September O
23, 2021, another information report which bore the question: “Can France contribute to the N
European awakening in a Chinese 21st century?”144 The two vice-presidents of  the commission C
and rapporteurs, Sens. Pascal Allizard and Gisèle Jourda, respectively declared on this occasion E
that they “were very struck, four years ago, by the absence of  Europe in the face of  China’s P
global deployment. We must react and give ourselves the diplomatic, legislative and monetary T
means to face this power strategy”; “We must be aware of  the weight of  the Chinese United S
Front, which is not a form of  influence, but of  interference!”145 The French awakening is in fact 
part of  a European awakening, that the MEP Nathalie Loiseau embodied when she declared 
in January 2021 that “the time to be naive is behind us.”146

In concrete terms, this means that, thanks to the vigilance of  researchers, journalists, politicians, 
diplomats and the general public, France is now a less soft, less easy target for Chinese in-
fluence. Tongues are loosening, self-censorship is becoming less acceptable, pressure is being 
denounced, as is complacency. When Livres Hebdo published an article announcing that “The A
Frenchman Maxime Vivas receives a prize at the Beijing Book Fair,”147 as if  it were neutral C
news, a few days later a score of  researchers, sinologists, tibetologists, specialists of  Uyghurs, T
including the president of  INALCO Jean-François Huchet, published a tribune in which they O
condemned what “seems to be a copy-paste of  what can be read in the official organs of  the R
Chinese Communist Party […]. That Livres Hebdo highlights the prizes awarded by the Chinese S
Communist Party is fine, but one would expect from a magazine intended for book professionals 
that the reviews bring a critical, detailed and well-argued perspective and are not simple relays of  
Chinese propaganda.”148 This example, taken among others, illustrates the fact that the French, or 
at least a growing number of  them, have finally “woken up” and are making the environment less 
permissive to the ambitions of  the Party-State. In summary, awareness in France of  the risks 
posed by Chinese influence has been strong and growing since 2019, with a clear accel- A
eration in 2020-2021. It is in this context of  a “French awakening,” which now seems C
irreversible, that the publication of  this present report in September 2021 takes place. T

Even Central and Eastern European countries, the traditional spearheads of  Beijing S

in Europe (→ p. 310), are becoming more reticent: the “17+1” Summit, on February 9, 
2021, was actually a “17-6” meeting because, in front of  Xi Jinping, six European states lim-
ited their participation to a mere ministerial delegation. The reasons for this loss of  appetite 
are known: “the Chinese infrastructural promises have disappointed, trade exchanges have

T
I Some now believe that the ‘”17+1” format – which was meant to be a European door for 
O
N Beijing – is becoming a “zombie mechanism” which could progressively unravel. Lithuania 

has led the way by withdrawing in March 2021 and calling on the other eleven European 
members to do the same.150 In September, the Lithuanian foreign minister explained that 

C the only format in which the balance of  power would be balanced would be a 27+1, which 
O would require unity among European countries when facing China.151 The bilateral rela-
N tionship had deteriorated sharply in July 2021 when Lithuania announced the opening of  
C
E a representative office of  “Taiwan” (not “Taipei”) in the country. The following month, 
P Beijing and Vilnius recalled their ambassadors. In September, the Lithuanian National 
T Cybersecurity Center issued a report concluding that the phones of  three Chinese brands 
S (Xiaomi, Huawei and OnePlus) posed risks, including remote censorship, and the deputy 

defense minister declared: “Our recommendation is not to buy new Chinese smartphones 
and to get rid of  those already acquired as quickly as possible.”152 And the press emphasized 
how “small” Lithuania has become a symbol of  resistance to the Chinese superpower.153 
The Czech Republic is another example: despite Beijing’s strong proxies in that coun-

A
C try, particularly in the political (starting with President Miloš Zeman and several mem-
T bers of  the government) and economic spheres (PPF → p. 272), the Chinese influence is 
O increasingly being challenged and denounced, from the resistance of  the mayor of  Prague 
R (→ p. 266) to the Senate president’s visit to Taiwan (→ p. 267), to the exclusion of  Huawei 
S

and ZTE from 5G-related tenders, and to the publication of  reports by the cybersecurity 
agency (NUKIB) and the Security and Internal Intelligence Service (BIS), whose regular 
alerts contribute to the debate.

One after the other, states reevaluate their relations to China, taking legislative, 
economic and political actions to protect themselves from it. Increasingly, states also coor-

A dinate their actions to “stand together” against China. Here, March 26, 2021 was rather 
C

I Germany, the United Kingdom and others – met in front of  the Chinese tribunal where 
O Michael Kovrig was tried154 – one of  the two Canadians victim of  the “hostage diplomacy” 
N
S (→ p. 411). Meanwhile, the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and 

Canada sanctioned several Chinese officials involved in the repression against Uyghurs, 
in a coordinated effort that sent “the clearest message […] that the international com-
munity will not turn a blind eye to such serious and systematic violations of  basic human 
rights,” according to the UK Foreign Secretary.155 These were actually the first European

sanctions in more than thirty years, the last (an embargo on weapons) dating back to D
U

1989 – an additional sign of  the degradation of  the relations. Furthermore, and again, C

on that very day, the Chinese sanctions against four entities and ten European officials T
I

only reinforced the European solidarity against Beijing, at all levels, even among the O
N

civil society. Three days later, the directors of  32 European think tanks and research insti-
tutes, from more than twenty countries, signed a declaration denouncing Chinese sanctions 
against European researchers and the most important European research center on China, C
MERICS (→ p. 285).156 O

The result is paradoxical: while one of  the Party-State’s strategies is to divide Europe, N
its behavior unites Europe against itself, losing the levers (such as the 17+1) it had C

E
hoped to enjoy. In the same way, while one of  the strategies of  the Party-State is to weaken P
the transatlantic relationship, by making European countries keep their distance from the T
logic of  the Sino-American “cold war” and adopt a third way instead, by its behavior it is S

bringing them closer to Washington – all the more so since, with the change of  administra-
tion, the U.S. discourse on China is less caricatural, and therefore more acceptable. As Sylvie 
Kauffmann summarizes it well, “through clumsiness or hubris, China is pushing the 
Europeans into the arms of  the Americans.157 It is, in short, self-sabotage.

This movement is not limited to state officials: populations are awakening to the problem A
C

and, in almost all countries, China’s image has never been as bad as it is today.158 China is T
facing an “unpopularity problem.”159 A European study, conducted in September and O
October 2020, confirmed the largely negative opinions of  China, except in Serbia and in R

S
Russia.160 In Australia, “trust in China is at the lowest level ever recorded in the Lowy Institute 
Poll, with only 23% of  Australians saying they trust China somewhat or a lot ‘to act respon-
sibly in the world’, a 29-point fall since 2018.”161 Even in South Korea, a country that has 
maintained close ties to China, the discontents toward China have reached 75%.162

Since 2020 approximately, and particularly after the start of  the pandemic during which 
China became more aggressive, analysts have tried to explain the “counter-productive A
behavior”163 adopted by Beijing. Even if  the explanation is known – for the Party-State, C

T
the priority is not to seduce local populations but to ensure its survival and to strengthen I
its power in China – the Party-State was probably not prepared for the fallout of  such a O
behavior. Indeed, its unpopularity has become a problem so pregnant that it could N

S
indirectly weaken the Party, including vis-à-vis the Chinese population. Anyhow, this 
is certainly the message that needs to be carried to make Chinese officials more cognizant 
to the consequences of  their actions.

“WOLF WARRIOR” DIPLOMACY: A NEW POLICY TO LEGITIMIZE 
THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY 

Dr. Camille BRUGIER
China Research Fellow, IRSEM

ABSTRACT
For several years, and especially since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, some Chi-
nese diplomats, commonly called “wolf warriors” by Western media, have adopted 
a warlike tone in the media and on social networks. While this new practice, heavily 
criticized by Western and Asian public opinion, reinforces the perception of China 
as a threat, this paper questions the motives of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) 
in perpetuating such a policy. The paradox is that the real target of China’s foreign 
policy are the Chinese themselves, at home or abroad. In line with previous Chinese 
leaders, the main purpose of this domestically oriented foreign policy is to legitimize 
the CCP in the eyes of its own citizens. Thus, “wolf warrior” diplomacy does not affect 
the objectives of Chinese foreign policy. Three elements support this hypothesis: the 
visibility of the “wolf warriors” in China, the subtle references to the “century of humili-
ation” and finally the instrumentalization of the cultural divide to alienate democratic 
regimes. Céline Marangé et Maud

RUSSIAN STRATEGIES OF INFLUENCE 
IN THE SOUTH CAUCASUS REGION 

Régis GENTÉ
Journalist and former-Soviet Republics Expert

ABSTRACT
Russia uses a variety of methods to influence its former Soviet republics of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Since its conquest of the region in the 19th Century, Russia 
considers Transcaucasia particularly important for its geopolitical standing. No longer 
able to persuade or attract South Caucasus populations, Russia’s strategy of influ-
ence is largely based on military power (hard power). It struggles to develop its soft 
power in this region, resorting finally to more coercive methods like exploiting: con-
flicts in the secessionist regions of Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia; 
Kremlin-affiliated oligarchs; and energy prices. This traps Russia in a vicious cycle: to 
retain its influence in the South Caucasus, it becomes increasingly coercive and ag-
gressive, appearing malevolent to local populations. The Kremlin relies on well-known 
and established strategies in the South Caucasus, making it an important case study 
in the analysis of Russian foreign policy in general.

THE DISSEMINATION OF RUSSIAN-SOURCED NEWS IN AFRICA
A preliminary general map

Kevin LIMONIER
Lecturer at the French Geopolitics Institute (Paris 8 University)

ABSTRACT
Although the Russian media apparatus is subject to considerable scrutiny in the West, it is much less so in 
other regions of the world, in particular in Africa. Consequently, at a time when Russia appears to be attemp-
ting to regain footing on the continent, it seemed necessary to undertake a preliminary exploration of the 
role that this country can play in the African information space, with particular focus on the French-speaking 
countries of Africa. This paper presents the results of a quantitative study of the distribution and propagation 
of information content produced by the Russian news agencies RT (Russia Today) and Sputnik News. On the Jean-Baptiste Jeangène Vilmer, 
basis of the data collected, it has been possible to establish an initial general map of the circulation paths of 
this content, its relays and the discursive strategies used by the various players involved. In addition to its 
empirical value as an aid to understanding the real state of Russian implantation in the information space of 
the French-speaking African world, this paper also aims to highlight the methodological possibilities available, Alexandre Escorcia, Marine 
by explaining the methods used here, at the intersection of geopolitics and big data.

RESEARCH PAPER – No. 66



 

For a long time, it could be said that China, unlike Russia, sought to be loved 
rather than feared; that it wanted to seduce and project a positive image of 
itself in the world, or to inspire admiration. Today, Beijing has not renounced 
to seduce, nor its overall attractiveness and its ambition to shape international 
standards, and it is essential for the Chinese Communist Party not to lose face. 
And yet, Beijing is also increasingly comfortable with infiltration and coercion: its 
influence operations have become considerably tougher in recent years and its 
methods are resembling more closely the ones employed by Moscow. This is a 
“Machiavellian turn” inasmuch as the Party-State now seems to believe that “it 
is much safer to be feared than to be loved,” in the words of Machiavelli in The 
Prince. This is a clear Russification of Chinese influence operations. 
This report delves into this evolution, with the ambition to cover the whole specter 
of influence, from the most benign (public diplomacy) to the most malign methods, 
that is, interference (clandestine activities). To do that, the report is divided into four 
parts: successively laying out the main concepts; the actors implementing these 
operations, including the Base 311 of the People’s Liberation Army; the actions 
conducted by Beijing toward the diasporas, the media, diplomacy, economy, 
politics, education, think tanks, and in terms of information manipulations – 
some levers among others; then, several cases are studied (Taiwan, Singapore, 
Sweden, Canada, the operations that targeted Hong Kong protestors in 2019, 
and the one that branded the Covid-19 as an American fabrication in 2020). The 
conclusion returns to this “Russification”, which has three components: Beijing 
is inspired by Moscow in several ways, there are obviously differences between 
the two, and there is also a certain degree of cooperation. Finally, the report 
assesses the effectiveness of this new Chinese posture, which can boast some 
tactical successes, but constitutes a strategic failure.

**Disclaimer:** If you are not running Windows on your host, you might not get anything out
of this post. Sorry Tux. I am convinced that the Windows Sandbox is one of the best
virtualization solutions to do dynamic malware analysis (for Windows malware, at least). The
reason is quite simple: Distinguishing a Windows 10 Sandbox instance from the actual
underlying Windows 10 install should be very difficult for malware. Specifically if the host is
running on HyperV with Guarded Host enabled, my current understanding is that there are
little to no differences between the two, but they are neatly isolated from one another. The
configuration options are limited, but you can easily cook up a config that launches a
WindowsSandbox instance that has all the tools you need for some basic unpacking &
dynamic analysis. This is what my malware analysis sandbox looks like at launch:

I have successfully executed a number of samples that evade execution in other virtualized
environments. That's a far cry from rigorous testing, so take my praise with a grain of salt.
Still, it might be worth a try, the setup is really easy. ### My Config The [Windows Sandbox
documentation][WSDOCS] should have everything you need for installation, that bit is fairly
straightforward. What the documentation doesn't have is a ready-to-go, copy & paste
example configuration. So here it is:

1/3



<Configuration> 
   <AudioInput>Disable</AudioInput> 
   <ClipboardRedirection>Disable</ClipboardRedirection> 
   <MemoryInMB>4096</MemoryInMB> 
   <Networking>Disable</Networking> 
   <PrinterRedirection>Disable</PrinterRedirection> 
   <ProtectedClient>Enable</ProtectedClient> 
   <vGPU>Enable</vGPU> 
   <VideoInput>Disable</VideoInput> 
   <LogonCommand> 
       <Command>powershell.exe -ep unrestricted 
c:\\tooling\\newsandbox.ps1</Command> 
   </LogonCommand> 
   <MappedFolders> 
       <MappedFolder> 
           <HostFolder>w:\vmshare\tooling</HostFolder> 
           <SandboxFolder>c:\tooling</SandboxFolder> 
           <ReadOnly>true</ReadOnly> 
       </MappedFolder> 
       <MappedFolder> 
           <HostFolder>w:\vmshare\airlock</HostFolder> 
           <SandboxFolder>c:\airlock</SandboxFolder> 
           <ReadOnly>false</ReadOnly> 
       </MappedFolder> 
   </MappedFolders> 
</Configuration> 

You put this into a file called malware-analysis.wsb  and that's it. The .wsb  file type
should be associated with the Windows Sandbox executable, so shell-executing the file
(read: double-clicking it) should launch a new Windows Sandbox instance with that
configuration. Most of the settings are fairly obvious. This configuration is my offline analysis
sandbox which has no internet connection. I give the VM a decent amount of memory to
avoid being detected based on poor hardware specs. All other settings are configured to lock
down the sandbox instance as tightly as possible. I use two shared folders: -
w:\vmshare\tooling  contains [ProcessHacker][], [SysInternals][], and [x64dbg][] with

[OllyDumpEx][] and [ScyllaHide][] plugins installed. - w:\vmshare\airlock  is the location
where the malware goes into the sandbox, and dumps come out. You can have the Windows
Sandbox execute a brief setup script during startup. My script is the following:

2/3



[CmdletBinding(PositionalBinding=$false)] 
Param( 
   [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)] 
   [string] $Src = "c:\tooling" 
) 
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine 

$wsh = New-Object -comObject WScript.Shell 

$shortcuts = @( 
   @("x32dbg", "$Src\x64dbg\release\x32\x32dbg.exe"), 
   @("x64dbg", "$Src\x64dbg\release\x64\x64dbg.exe"), 
   @("hacker", "$Src\ProcessHacker\64bit\ProcessHacker.exe") 
) 
$copyfile = @( 
   @("pm0nitor.exe", "$Src\SysinternalsSuite\Procmon64.exe"), 
   @("autoruns.exe", "$Src\SysinternalsSuite\autoruns64.exe") 
) 

$copyfile | ForEach-Object { 
   $dst = Join-Path "$Home\Desktop" $_[0] 
   Copy-Item $_[1] $dst 
} 
$shortcuts | ForEach-Object { 
   $dst = $_[0] 
   $sc = $wsh.CreateShortcut("$Home\Desktop\$dst.lnk") 
   $sc.TargetPath = $_[1] 
   $sc.Save() 
} 

All it does is make PowerShell execute at unrestricted by default and place a few shortcuts
on the desktop to my analysis tooling. You can obviously do more here. ### Caveats I am
only recommending the Windows Sandbox for very simple dynamic analysis, mainly for: -
unpacking packed binaries with [x64dbg][] and [ProcessHacker][] - verifying hypotheses
formed during static analysis - deobfuscating obfuscated PowerShell, JScript, and VBScript
dynamically It is not well-suited for more complex scenarios. There was a [very nice piece
about Windows Sandbox internals][CPBLOG] which illustrates how you can replace the
Windows Sandbox base image with your own. The article is very interesting but quite frankly,
I would rather set up a proper VM than hack a different base image into the Windows
Sandbox. The big advantage for me is that I get an extremely well-hardened virtualization
solution with close to zero effort. [WSDOCS]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
