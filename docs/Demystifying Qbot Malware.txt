Executive summary
The Trellix SecOps Team has observed an uptick in the Qbot malware infections in recent
months. Qbot has been an active threat for over 14 years and continues to evolve, adopting
new infection vectors to evade detection mechanisms.

At Trellix, we are committed to protecting our customers from upcoming and emerging threats
on the their network, inclusive of those that are found being exploited in the wild. Trellix
SecOps strives to build advanced detection features, improving product’s overall Threat
Detection capabilities. Over the next few sections of this blog, we will highlight TTPs of Qbot
malware, detection capabilities in Trellix products. and some detection strategies which help
protect customers against this and future attacks of similar nature.

Introduction
Qbot, also known as QakBot, QuackBot and Pinkslipbot, is a common trojan malware designed
to steal passwords. Over time this malware has evolved from simple infostealer malware to an
infostealer with a backdoor functionality. The malware has been active since 2008 and is
primarily used by financially motivated actors. Qbot actors have also served as ‘Initial Access
Brokers’ to many ransomware partners including REvil/Sodinokibi. In the latest versions of
Qbot Payload, we have observed significant changes in its TTPs, including new delivery
vectors to evade detection mechanisms.

In 2022-Q1&Q2, Trellix has detected ~500K Qbot URLs in FAUDE (FireEye Advanced URL
Detection Engine) with a peak of 189,313 URLs in Apr-2022.

Trellix has been studying this malware and discovered a significant uptick in the spread of Qbot
malware over the first half of 2022 using several new techniques. We put together a
comprehensive analysis detailing its TTPs, IOCs, Detection & Hunting Schemas and defence
mechanisms from Trellix products.

Qbot threat landscape
The Qbot threat landscape with reference to the geopolitical regions and industry verticals has
changed from time to time and we have compiled regions and verticals targeted as shown in
below section:

Figure 2: QbBot threat landscape summary
 

Infection vector: email
Initially Qbot was distributed by Emotet malware, but currently the major infection vector is
malspam email campaigns with multiple variants. Over the next section, we discuss the
prevalent variants across customers.

Breaking down the Qbot malware
The most prevalent way Qbot infects its victims is via email. The emails used in the latest
campaign carry an HTML file (TXRTN_2636021.html). The user downloads the HTML
attachment and opens it in their browser which downloads a password-protected ZIP archive
(TXRTN_2636021.zip) with an ISO file inside.

Figure 7: The html file renders in the user browser showing the password to open the dropped
zip file 

 

HTML smuggling: highly evasive malware delivery technique
(MITRE: Defense Evasion/Obfuscated Files or Information: HTML Smuggling (T1027.006))
HTML smuggling is an evasive payload delivery method that helps an attacker smuggle a
payload past content filters and firewalls by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly
benign HTML files. On opening the html file in vscode/ notepad ++ we can easily see how this

6/30



is being done. There is a very long base64encoded variable that is present in the javascript
section of this HTML file. The javascript assembles the zip package and drops it to the device.

Figure 8: HTML content showing the smuggled zip payload
On Unzipping the ZIP file with the password shown the in h tml document, user gets the ISO
file.

Figure 9: 7zip snip showing the zip file and iso
On mounting the ISO, user sees only the ‘LNK ’(Shortcut) file; the rest of which are hidden.

(MITRE: Defense Evasion/Subvert Trust Controls: Mark-of-the-Web Bypass (T1553.005))

Figure 10: Lnk File shown to User
On unpacking this ISO, there are 4  files inside of it as shown below. The ISO contains a .LNK
file(shortcut), calc.exe (Windows Calculator), and two DLL files, namely WindowsCodecs.dll
and Qbot payload named 102755.dll

Figure 11: ISO contents showing dll’s, lnk file and calc.exe
The user clicking the shortcut file triggers the Qbot malware infection by executing the
‘calc.exe’ through the Command Prompt.

Why a Windows 7 calculator?
DLL Sideloading:
(MITRE: Defense Evasion/Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002))
Windows allows applications to load DLLs at runtime. Applications can specify the location of
DLLs to load by specifying a full path, using DLL redirection, or by using an application
manifest. If none of these methods are used, it attempts to locate the DLL by searching a
predefined set of directories in a set order.

When the shortcut loads, the Windows 7 Calculator, it automatically searches for and attempts
to load the legitimate WindowsCodecs DLL file. However, it does not check for the DLL in
certain hard coded paths and will load any DLL file with the same name if placed in the same
folder as the Calc.exe executable.

In the below snip, you can see that Calc.exe was placed in the desktop path and executed.
Once it starts execution, it searches and loads WindowsCodecs DLL. However, the DLL was
not present in the desktop path, hence it shows in ‘Result’ tab as “NAME NOT FOUND”.

Figure 13: Calc.exe sideloading windowscodecs.dll
This doesn’t work anymore with the Windows 10 version of the calculator application. Hence
the threat actors behind Qbot, bundled Windows 7 calc.exe along with this.

Now What?
The attacker takes advantage of this flaw by creating their own malicious WindowsCodecs.dll
file that launches the other dll file, which is nothing but the QuakBot malware(loader module).
Thus, by launching Qbot through a trusted program like the Windows Calculator, attackers can
easily fool security analysts and some security software.

10/30



How is it so stealthy?
The bundled calculator app is a legit benign Windows 7 calculator. But with the aforementioned
flaw, the calculator loads the ‘windowscodecs.dll’ from the same directory, which is specifically
crafted by the adversary. On executing the calculator, it loads windowscodecs.dll which in turn
loads the Qbot loader payload via regsvr32.

Figure 14: Windows codecs leveraging regsvr32 via CreateProcessW to load the Qbot loader
DLL 
This  Qbot loader DLL is a x32 bit Delphi compiled binary, with no export functions.

Figure 15: Qbot loader DLL (Delphi compiled 32bit binary)
But as it is executed and gets unpacked, the core Qbot payload is a VC (C/C++) compiled
binary (DLL) with export functions.

11/30



Figure 16: Qbot core module (C/C++ compiled 32bit binary)
On analyzing this core module further, it does the same che cks as seen in previous versions of
Qbot payloads.

Below shows the malware payload checking for Windows Defender Emulation using WinAPI
GetFileAttributes “C:\INTERNAL\__empty”.

Figure 17: Qbot checking GetFileAttributesW
The payload also uses flag SELF_TEST_1 w hich appears to be for self-debugging purposes to
check if the machine is infected or not.

Figure 18: Qbot self-check using SELF_TEST_1 flag
After the self-check debugging test, the malware crea tes a new thread and starts its execution.

12/30



Figure 19: Qbot creating remote thread
Later, this payload module loads/import s DLLs, enumerating the system process along with
anti-debug checks and leading the payload to inject to explorer.exe/wermgr.exe via process
hollowing.

How does it gain persistence?
As Qbot has evolved, it continues to rely on the use of scheduled tasks and registry
keys/runkeys for its persistence with variations on its implementation.

As the core payload gets executed, the Qbot gains its persistence via 3 steps:

1. Copying itself to below mentioned folder:
%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\{Random Strings}

2. Creating a registry value pointing to the above payload
3. Scheduled task to launch the loader 102755.dll

Folder Creations:

Dropped DLLs are loaded via regsvr32.exe as shown in below:  

13/30



Figure 21: Executing Dropped DLLs via RegSvr32
 

Registry entries:
(MITRE: Persistence/Defense Evasion/Modify Regsitry)
In the latest payload versions, Qbot has moved from creating its config file in “.dat” format.
Now, it writes its cloned dDLL entry in the victim host along with its botnet/campaign ID as
encrypted registry keys to the ‘HKCU\Software\Microsoft\’ Hive.

Figure 22: Registry keys created in HKCU Hive
Registry entries are encrypted using system de pendant password hash, config IDs, etc., which
upon decrypting reveals the BotID/Campaign ID, time of the infection, DLL loader path, etc.

14/30



Figure 23: Decrypted registry keys
 

Scheduled task persistence:
(MITRE: Persistence/Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task)
One of the most significant ways payload versions of Qbot differ are their creation of
Scheduled Tasks for persistence. Recent Qbot payloads have been seen using random
generated task names during its creations.

The injected Explorer.exe creates scheduled task leveraging schtasks.exe

Figure 24: Scheduled tasks creation
Above command is base64decoded  and can be decoded which results in below figure:

15/30

Calling home: C2 communications
(MITRE: System Binary Proxy Execution/Command & Control)
Once it executes and successfully infects the victim, it calls home. It pings each of the IPs from
its hardcoded C2 list. As the IP responds, it sends the POST request with the victim
fingerprinting data.

The injected process (explorer.exe/ wermgr.exe), pings every one of its IP in the C2 lists
leveraging wininet, dnsapi and sleep function. Sleep function is set so the requests to IPs
aren’t creating bottlenecks in communication.

Figure 26: wermgr process initiated a C2 connection
 

16/30



Figure 27: C2 communications
To those C2s which responds b ack to ping requests, the Qbot sends POST requests which
consists of victim fingerprinting details as seen below:
