malware case study and provide mitigation steps.

Kroll has observed an increase in the number of active GOOTLOADER malware
campaigns targeting a variety of sectors, including the legal, financial and professional
services sectors.
Analysis of Kroll cases identified that GOOTLOADER was delivered into victim
environments via search engine optimization (SEO), using compromised WordPress
sites that host malicious documents masquerading as generic legal and contract
templates.
Following the initial GOOTLOADER compromise, further tooling such as
COBALTSTRIKE, SYSTEMBC and open-source scripts were observed being deployed
into victim environments.
In Kroll’s observations, a secondary payload, such as ransomware, was not deployed.
Requests for extortion were not observed and even in cases with significant exfiltration,
Kroll did not identify the stolen data to be leaked or discussed on the dark web or other
threat actor websites.
Based on these findings, Kroll assesses that the goal of these attacks is likely to
conduct corporate espionage to gain insight into intellectual property such as the
financial details of mergers and acquisitions or proprietary research and development
plans.

malware case study and provide mitigation steps.

Summary
Kroll has analyzed incidents throughout Q1 2023 where drive-by compromise was the initial
infection vector for GOOTLOADER malware. It is likely that the threat actors are utilizing
SEO to drive individuals to either their own malicious website or to infected WordPress sites.
These sites are then used to host documents that would be attractive to employees within
the legal and professional services sectors. A key search term used by victims across Kroll
cases and open-source reporting is “agreement,” such as “transition services agreement,”
“stock purchase agreement” and “transaction agreement”. Upon using search terms similar
to the above, the malicious websites will display in the top results of the search engine,
through SEO poisoning. Similar to a tactic we’ve observed where threat actors manipulate
Google Ads in order to drive users to malicious sites, this technique encourages users to
click on a malicious link that will take the victim to an actor-controlled site where
GOOTLOADER is hosted. GOOTLOADER leverages a vulnerable WordPress plugin to
detect and ensure that the victim has not visited the site before, their operating system is
Windows, they are English-speaking and the associated IP address is not blocked, before
downloading a zip file from another compromised site. The zip file contains a JavaScript (JS)
file named after the item searched, which, when opened, creates a scheduled task to
execute a second stage JS file from the user profile.

This script sets up a SYSTEMBC remote access trojan to connect to command-and-control
(C2) IP addresses before increasing remote access by deploying COBALTSTRIKE. It is
highly likely that the threat actors then undertake a “hands-on” approach to identify data for
exfiltration by utilizing tools such as FileZilla to upload to cloud storage sites.

Based on Kroll’s observations, there has been no evidence of extortion, ransomware
encryption or discussion about any exfiltrated data on the deep and dark web (DDW). In
these internally observed cases, it is unlikely that the activity was of a financially motivated
criminal group, and it is more indicative of a corporate espionage-related activity. However,
the foothold gained by a threat actor using GOOTLOADER could be leveraged by other
groups, such as ransomware actors. 

Typical GOOTLOADER Infection Chain

Initial Infection
GOOTLOADER is observed during the initial access phase of a compromise and is
commonly seen distributed by SEO. Threat actors have also been observed compromising
legitimate websites to host their malicious content, and often vulnerable WordPress
sites have been exploited to deliver the malware. The benefits of SEO poisoning compared
to other social engineering techniques, such as phishing, is that it is much harder for
defenders to detect activity at this stage as there is no interaction with the victim
infrastructure; it is just essentially waiting for a user to reach out and download the malicious
content.

SEO Poisoning

6/16



SEO Poisoning

SEO poisoning is a technique that abuses the way search engines index sites for
prioritization for a user. There are a number of ways in which a threat actor may conduct
SEO poisoning, such as copying content from a legitimate site into their own or filling a
page with keywords to manipulate the search engine algorithm and increase the site’s
visibility. These sites are also likely tailored to commonly used words to target a specific
victim or industry sector and aligned to the lure file that contains malware.

Regarding GOOTLOADER delivery, we have seen themes focused on business-related lures
such as legal matters, agreements and contracts. Some of the file names we have observed
being downloaded by victims are:

what_states_have_tax_reciprocity.zip
workplace_technology_agreement.zip
what_is_isda_agreement.zip”

In one example, the presented webpage (below) appeared to look like a forum with
comments that related to the search term. This forum thread was also seen in a number of
different GOOTLOADER campaigns in open source, therefore it is almost certain that the
threat actor set it up https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/threat-intelligence-
reports/q3-2022-threat-landscape-insider-threat-trojan-horseto provide legitimacy for posting
the malicious link. The comment from the page “Admin” contained a download of the
malicious .zip file named identical to the search term used by the victim.

Execution and Persistence
In cases from March and April 2023, we observed users downloading .zip files containing a
malicious JS file that was identified as GOOTLOADER using internal threat intelligence
sources and open source. Once the zip file was unzipped and malicious JS file was executed
by the user, a second JS file was dropped into the %APPDATA% folder. The second-stage
script then attempted to connect to C2 domains via wscript.exe and cscript.exe, executed by
PowerShell scripts (example shown below).

The initial JS file also goes on to create a registry key to add a root certificate, and also
creates a scheduled task that typically points to the second JS file for persistence. In other
incident response cases, the execution of a COBALTSTRIKE DLL was also observed for
persistence in these scheduled tasks.

Example Execution Chain

Following this initial foothold by a threat actor, Kroll observed the following post-compromise
activity:

Toolkit Deployment
Once a connection is made to the C2 domains, the threat actor loads the adversary
simulation framework COBALTSTRIKE onto the infected machine and attempts to move
laterally via named pipes and remote service creation. The remote access trojan known as
SYSTEMBC is also leveraged to maintain persistent access to the network by utilizing
SOCKS5 proxies to hide network traffic from security appliances.

Internal Scouting
After gaining initial access and establishing a foothold within the network, the threat actor
leverages tools such as Advanced IP Scanner and the Bloodhound variant PSHound.ps1 to
enumerate endpoints on the network and Active Directory information. The PowerSploit tool

Powerview.ps1 was also observed  likely in an attempt to identify file servers for data
exfiltration. Process Hacker is sometimes used to view running software, likely to identify
security tooling.

Escalation
Privilege escalation is likely gained via COBALTSTRIKE or PowerSploit modules. Multiple
legitimate accounts are then leveraged to gain access to other endpoints and file servers.
Lateral Movement  

Legitimate accounts are leveraged along with COBALTSTRIKE remote service execution to
move around the network laterally. Typically, only a small number of endpoints are utilized,
with the key goal of gaining sensitive documents.

Mission Execution
The threat actor attempts to exfiltrate sensitive information via automated collection tools
such as FileZilla and FreeFileSync to upload to a remote cloud storage site. The file transfer
protocol (FTP) may also be leveraged to send files to controlled infrastructure. Kroll has not
identified ransomware encryption in internal cases, nor has Kroll observed sales within DDW
marketplaces or discussions relating to stolen data from GOOTLOADER. This suggests that
this activity is a targeted espionage campaign.

Detection Opportunities
The following are examples of events that could provide detection opportunities to identify
GOOTLOADER activity early in the attack chain:

Script files creating scheduled tasks (particularly PowerShell and JS)
Script files spawning PowerShell, followed by external connections
User opening .zip files with .js file inside
.php URLs downloading a .zip file (will likely require tuning to environment to identify
anomalies)
