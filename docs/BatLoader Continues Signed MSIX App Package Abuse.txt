TALK TO AN EXPERT
Adversaries don’t work 9-5 and neither do we. At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with
Elite Threat Hunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to
threats within minutes.

We have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our
space – including the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.

Our Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat
Response and Advanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU
team.

In TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent
threat investigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what
recommendations we have going forward.

Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…

What did we find?
In July, the eSentire Threat Response Unit (TRU) identified multiple BatLoader cases
investigated by our SOC team. In these cases, the victims fell for suspected malicious
advertisements impersonating Zoom and TradingView after performing web searches for

2/15



these products.

The victims had then downloaded malicious MSIX installer files (such as Zoom-x64.msix)
which attempted to infect their systems with Redline Stealer and SectopRAT. These were the
first such observations in our telemetry since May 2023. Our analysis here will focus on
discovering imposter websites and MSIX samples currently being used in BatLoader
campaigns.

BatLoader Imposter Sites Registered on June - July 2023
TRU identified several suspected BatLoader payload sites hosted on IP 80.68.159.10
registered in June and July 2023:

tradling-view[.]com
get-adobe[.]net
zooml-us[.]com
open-aii[.]com
mldiourney[.]com
store-steampowered[.]net
mlcrosoft-online[.]net
qul-cken[.]com

The domain names suggest an array of brands are impersonated in these attacks, including
Microsoft, Zoom, Adobe, Steam, OpenAI, etc. (a more complete list can be found at the end
of this blog). These brands have been used historically in previous BatLoader attacks, and
landing pages comprise of an imposter download page for these products.

When visited manually, these sites present empty content or 403 HTTP errors, and
successful recreation of infection chains has been minimal thus far. This may suggest
operators may have improved the cloaking of these sites to evade discovery by researchers
and scanners.

We did identify one successfully rendered page for Steam (store-steampowered[.]net)
submitted to Urlscan.io on June 6, which shows an imposter page for the gaming service.
The website was registered the same day and served a legitimate Steam binary at the time.

We assess this site likely served Steam-x64.msix (md5:
c37aee1ebad9b0f7bd2e7755a3133d0e) in mid-July 2023 shown in Figure 2 below.

BatLoader Continues to Abuse Signed MSIX Packages
As we covered in our May blog, MSIX files are a relatively new installer format designed for
Windows 10 and above. It requires the package contents to be signed; a barrier intended to
limit abuse by threat actors. Unfortunately, these code signing certificates do find their way
into threat actor hands and can be acquired on underground forums for a fee.

In a February post on XSS forums, a suspected BatLoader operator vouched for a code
signing service offered by another forum member by providing a screenshot of their previous
transaction with this member:

purports to be the purchase of a code signing certificate from another forum member.
 

It's highly probable that BatLoader operators are purchasing the required code signing
certificates used in their campaigns from other threat actors.

The latest MSIX app packages reviewed by TRU contained content signed by IMPERIOUS
TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED, a private limited company based out of the UK.

configured with Russian-language settings.

When launched, the package executes with elevated privileges then executes an embedded
PowerShell script then drops and executes a legitimate copy of the Steam installer as a
decoy. The PowerShell script (“NEW_mormons_v1.ps1”, MD5:
d87bc0bcfa1976ffa6a165545fb7ca62) contains a similar structure to prior samples, with
some minor updates. It downloads Redline Stealer binary disguised as a jpg file (“czx.jpg”,
MD5: d5a1d54158e110a8d9b0eea06d37e26f) from hxxps://tatmacerasi[.]com and
SectopRAT/ArechClient (“zhelp.exe”, MD5: 3AC860860707BAAF32469FA7CC7C0192) from
hxxps://fullpower682[.]store.

Additional details on the PowerShell script can be seen in the annotated image below.

Similarities with prior BatLoader samples include:

Payloads
SectopRAT is downloaded as an encrypted RAR archive and decrypted using 7zip (also
downloaded). The SectopRAT payload (MD5: DD50DE3ACC26293986F40EB04F0F1A99) is
written to AppData\Local\Temp\ and injected into MsBuild.exe. It retrieves its C2
configuration from Pastebin and connects to 194.26.135[.]180 for command and control.

command-and-control.

How did we find it?
MDR for Endpoint identified MSIX activity and blocked subsequent behavior.

What did we do?
Our team of 24/7 SOC Cyber Analysts isolated the host and alerted the customer while
an investigation took place before remediating the threat.

What can you learn from this TRU positive?
Imposter sites distributed via ad platforms (such as Google Ads) have diminished since
the start of 2023 but remain a concern. It’s probable these ad services have improved
their processes to tamp down on abuse, but it’s also apparent that threats like
BatLoader have improved their tradecraft to circumvent these controls.

11/15



Targeted brands include products and services commonly found in business
environments. Infected, domain-joined systems offer more value for data theft and
follow-on intrusion attacks (e.g. ransomware).

Both Redline and SectopRAT provide a foundation to monetize infected assets
and exploit them for further intrusion actions.

Signed code is a barrier that can be circumvented. Code signing certificate services
can be acquired from criminal forums for a fee; BatLoader has likely used these
services to sign MSIX packages.
Suspicious MSIX execution can be identified by monitoring for PowerShell (or other
script formats) execution under aistubx64.exe.

For example: svchost.exe -> aistubx64.exe -> PowerShell.exe

Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU):
Protect endpoints against malware by:

Ensuring antivirus signatures are up-to-date.
Using a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool to
detect and contain threats.

Raise awareness of malware masquerading as legitimate applications, and include in
your Phishing and Security Awareness Training (PSAT) program. An effective PSAT
program emphasizes building cyber resilience by increasing risk awareness, rather
than trying to turn everyone into security experts.
Windows Defender Application Control provides options for managing packaged apps
(MSIX).
