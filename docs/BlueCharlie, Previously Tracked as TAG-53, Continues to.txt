Insikt Group has been tracking the threat activity group BlueCharlie, associated
with the Russia-nexus group Callisto/Calisto, COLDRIVER, and Star
Blizzard/SEABORGIUM. BlueCharlie, a Russia-linked threat group active since
2017, focuses on information gathering for espionage and hack-and-leak
operations. BlueCharlie has evolved its tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) and built new infrastructure, indicating sophistication in adapting to
public disclosures and improving operations security. While specific victims are
unknown, past targets include government, defense, education, political
sectors, NGOs, journalists, and think tanks.

Breakdown of terms used in BlueCharlie activity since November 2022

Recently, Insikt Group observed BlueCharlie build new infrastructure for likely
use in phishing campaigns and/or credential harvesting, which consists of 94
new domains. Several of the TTPs seen in the recent operation depart from
past activity, suggesting that BlueCharlie is evolving its operations, potentially
in response to public disclosures of its operations in industry reporting. Since
Insikt Groupâ€™s initial tracking of the group in September 2022, we have
observed BlueCharlie engage in several TTP shifts. These shifts demonstrate
that these threat actors are aware of industry reporting and show a certain level
of sophistication in their efforts to obfuscate or modify their activity, aiming to
stymie security researchers.

To counter BlueCharlie's threat, network defenders should enhance phishing
defenses, implement FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication, use threat
intelligence, and educate third-party vendors. BlueCharlie's continued use of
phishing and its historical adaptation to public reporting suggest it will remain
active and evolve further in its operations.
