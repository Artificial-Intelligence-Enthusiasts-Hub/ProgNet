We searched for EvilCoder Project samples in the wild and identified a few active instances of XWorm,
indicating that XWorm is a more prevalent and sophisticated variant. The malware is a .NET compiled
binary, using multiple persistence and defense evasion techniques.

The malicious binary can drop multiple malicious payloads at various system locations, can add and modify
registry entries, and can execute commands. Figure 2 shows the XWorm builder panel as shown on the
developer’s site.

Technical Analysis
XWorm is a .NET binary whose size is 45.5 KB. The file details of “XWorm.exe” are:

Upon execution, the malware sleeps for one second and performs various checks such as checking for a
mutex, detecting virtual machines, emulators, debugger, sandbox environments, and Anyrun. If any of
these instances are present, the malware terminates itself.

Figure 5 – Anti Analysis

Techniques Used by XWorm
The malware enumerates the installed programs in the users’ machine and checks for strings, VMWare,
and VirtualBox. If these are present, the malware terminates itself, as shown in the figure below.

7/17



Figure 6 – Malware Checks for Virtualization Software
The malware uses the tick count of the machine to detect emulators. The malware then calls the
CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent() method to identify the debugger’s presence in the user’s machine.

The malware can also detect the sandbox environment if “SbieDll.dll” is present in the system. The malware
specifically checks if it is running in the Anyrun sandbox environment by checking the response text from ip-
api.com.

If the response is set to “True, ” it terminates its execution. The figure below shows the anti-analysis code
snippet.

Figure 7 – Malware Performs Various Anti-Analysis Checks
To establish persistence, the malware drops itself into the start-up folder. The malware also copies itself into
the “AppData” folder and creates a scheduled task entry.

Finally, the malware creates an autorun entry in the registry to ensure the malware executes whenever the
system restarts. The figure below shows the persistence activities performed by the malware.

9/17



Figure 8 – Malware Routine to establish persistence on a victim machine
After establishing persistence, the malware initiates communication with the C&C server. Then, the
malware creates a new thread that collects and sends system details to the  C&C domain
system6458[.]ddns[.]net on Port 6666.

Exfiltrated details include information such as processor count, UserName, MachineName, OSVersion,
Malware version, date of malware creation, administrative privileges, webcam details, and antivirus
programs installed in the system.

Figure 9 – Malware Sending the System Details to C&C
All the important information such as C&C, encryption key, filename, and mutex name is stored in a public
class, “Settings,” as shown in the figure below.

Figure 10 –

Hardcoded Configuration Details of Malware
After the initial communication, the malware waits for instructions from the C&C server. The malware can
perform multiple tasks such as keylogging, screen capture, auto-update, self-destructing, running scripts,
and ransomware operations.

The malware has the routine Read(), which receives AES encrypted commands from the C&C, which are
then decrypted and used to perform associated operations. Some of these important operations are
discussed in the following section. The below figure shows the code snippet of malware that performs

DDoS and Clipper operations.

Figure 11 –

Routine to Perform DDoS and Clipper Operations
The malware has a routine to perform file folder operations like create files/folder, show, or hide files/folder,
exfiltrate files, etc. The figure below shows the file operation routines.

Operations of the Malware
The following figure shows the keylogging, screen capture, and mouse operations, along with
corresponding commands.

Figure 13 –

Routine for Keyboard Mouse and Screen Operations
The malware author also provides an encryption routine for ransomware operations, as shown below.

Figure 14 –

File Encryption Routine
This malware also has a routine for performing a Hidden Virtual Network Computing (HVNC) attack. HVNC
is a tactical means for malware to control a remote machine without the victim’s knowledge. The figure
below shows the routine for performing an HVNC attack.

Conclusion
This post showcases that even a malware developer with minimum or no responsibility can develop
malicious programs and sell them to various forums for monetary gains.

To get more customers, the malware developers provide multiple highly impactful and dangerous features
such as ransomware, HVNC, etc., to TAs.

We have observed similar trends earlier, where malware developers provide highly sophisticated tools to
cybercriminals for their own financial gain.

We will continue monitoring the latest threat actors and trends across the surface, deep and dark web and
keep our readers informed.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:  

How to prevent malware infection?

Download and install software only from official app stores like Play Store or the iOS App Store.
Use a reputed antivirus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as
PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Enable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile
device where possible.
Be wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone.
Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.
Be careful while enabling any permissions.
Keep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.

How to identify whether you are infected?

Regularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed on mobile devices.
Keep an eye on the alerts provided by Antiviruses and Android OS and take necessary actions
accordingly.
