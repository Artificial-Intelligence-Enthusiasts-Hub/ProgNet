Scenario, Requirements and Quiz Material
Traffic for this quiz occurred in an Active Directory (AD) environment during April 2023. The
infection is similar to previous IcedID activity tweeted by Unit 42 in March 2023. Details of the
Local Area Network (LAN) environment for the pcap follow.

LAN segment range: 10.4.19[.]0/24 (10.4.19[.]1 through 10.4.19[.]255)
Domain: boogienights[.]live
Domain controller IP address: 10.4.19[.]19
Domain controller hostname: WIN-GP4JHCK2JMV
LAN segment gateway: 10.4.19[.]1
LAN segment broadcast address: 10.4.19[.]255

This quiz requires Wireshark, and we recommend using the latest version of Wireshark, since it
has more features, capabilities and bug fixes over previous versions.

We also recommend readers customize their Wireshark display to better analyze web traffic. A
list of tutorials and videos is available. As always, we recommend using Wireshark in a non-
Windows environment like BSD, Linux or macOS when analyzing malicious Windows-based
traffic.

To obtain the pcap, visit our GitHub repository, download the April 2023 ZIP archive and extract
the pcap. Use infected as the password to unlock the ZIP archive.

Quiz Questions

2/22



For this IcedID infection, we ask participants to answer the following questions previously
described in our standalone quiz post:

What is the date and time in UTC the infection started?
What is the IP address of the infected Windows client?
What is the MAC address of the infected Windows client?
What is the hostname of the infected Windows client?
What is the user account name from the infected Windows host?
Is there any follow-up activity from other malware?

Quiz Answers
The AD environment for this pcap contains three Windows clients, but only one was infected with
IcedID.

Answers for this Wireshark quiz follow.

Malicious traffic for this infection started on April 19, 2023, at 15:31 UTC.
Infected Windows client IP address: 10.4.19[.]136
Infected Windows client MAC address: 14:58:d0:2e:c5:ae
Infected Windows client hostname: DESKTOP-SFF9LJF
Infected Windows client user account name: csilva
Follow-up activity: BackConnect traffic

Pcap Analysis: IcedID Chain of Events
To understand IcedID network traffic, you should understand the chain of events for an IcedID
infection. A flow chart illustrating this chain of events is shown in Figure 1.

3/22



Figure 1. Flowchart for chain of events in the April 2023 IcedID infection.
Most IcedID infections use a standard variant of IcedID. These infections typically use an EXE or
DLL that acts as an installer. This installer generates an unencrypted HTTP GET request that
retrieves a gzip-compressed binary. The installer then converts this binary into malware used for
a persistent IcedID infection.

The newly created, persistent IcedID generates HTTPS traffic to communicate with command
and control (C2) servers. The C2 activity can lead to BackConnect traffic, Cobalt Strike and
Virtual Network Computing (VNC) activity.

If the infected host is part of a high-value environment, an IcedID infection would likely lead to
ransomware.

Pcap Analysis: Infection Vector
Using Wireshark customized from our tutorials, apply a basic web filter to see if anything stands
out. Review the results in your column display. Look for unencrypted HTTP traffic over TCP port
80 directly to an IP address without an associated domain. This is a common characteristic in the
chain of events for various malware infections.

At 15:31:08 UTC, the host at 10.4.19[.]136 generated an HTTP GET request to
hxxp://80.77.25[.]175/main.php as shown below in Figure 2.

4/22



Figure 2. Suspicious HTTP traffic directly to an IP address shown in Wireshark.
Follow the TCP stream for this HTTP GET request, as shown in Figure 3. This should generate a
window for TCP stream 32, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 3. Following TCP stream for suspicious HTTP GET request. 

5/22



Figure 4. TCP stream for the suspicious HTTP GET request and response.
Figure 4 reveals HTTP request headers that contain a User-Agent string ending with
Edg/112.0.1722.48. This string indicates the traffic was likely generated by the Microsoft Edge
browser. However, web traffic generated by malware can spoof different User-Agent strings, and
some browser extensions also have this ability, so we cannot be certain this was actually
Microsoft Edge.

The HTTP response headers in Figure 4 show a 302 code, redirecting traffic to the following
URL:

6/22



hxxps://firebasestorage.googleapis[.]com/v0/b/serene-cathode-
377701.appspot.com/o/XSjwp6O0pq%2FScan_Inv.zip?alt=media&token=a716bdce-1373-44ed-
ae89-fdabafa31c61

This Firebase Storage URL has been reported as malicious by at least seven security vendors on
VirusTotal, and it appears in URLhaus tagged as IcedID. Fortunately, Google has taken the URL
offline, and it is no longer active.

To further refine our search, add the client’s IP address 10.4.19[.]136 to the basic web filter as
shown below in Figure 5. This reveals HTTPS traffic to firebasestorage.googleapis[.]com shortly
after traffic to the initial URL at hxxp://80.77.25[.]175/main.php.

Figure 5. HTTPS traffic to firebasestorage.googleapis[.]com after the initial suspicious
URL.Follow the TCP stream for the initial frame showing fire in the Wireshark column display.
The TCP stream reveals 273 KB of data sent from the server to the Windows host, as shown
below in Figure 6. This indicates a file might have been sent to the Windows host. 

7/22



Figure 6. TCP stream showing 275 KB of data sent from firebasestorage.googleapis[.]com to the
Windows host.While the Firebase Storage URL is tagged as IcedID on URLhaus, this only
indicates a distribution method for the IcedID installer. Based on this pcap, the victim opened a
link that led to the Firebase Storage URL, and that URL delivered a file for an IcedID installer.
The URLhaus entry for this Firebase Storage URL reveals the ZIP archive it previously hosted,
as shown in Figure 7.

8/22



Figure 7. URLhaus entry for our firebasestorage URL shows it delivered a zip archive.
The ZIP archive was submitted to Malware Bazaar. The archive is password-protected with the
ASCII string 1235, and it contains a file named Scan_Inv.exe. This Windows executable file is an
IcedID installer.

Pcap Analysis: IcedID Traffic
An IcedID loader first generates an unencrypted HTTP GET request over TCP port 80 to a
domain using GET / without any further URL. This returns a gzip binary used by the installer to
create the persistent malware on the victim’s host.

To find the gzip binary, use the same basic web filter with the victim’s IP address noted earlier in
Figure 5. Scroll down to an HTTP GET request to skigimeetroc[.]com at 15:35:39 UTC and follow
the TCP stream as shown below, in Figure 8.

Figure 8. Following the TCP stream for IcedID installer’s initial HTTP GET request.

9/22



This is TCP stream 53 from the pcap, as shown below in Figure 9. The HTTP request headers
for traffic generated by the IcedID installer have no User-Agent string. Note the cookie sent in the
request headers in Figure 9.

Figure 9. HTTP GET request generated by the IcedID installer.
The cookie line follows:

Cookie: __gads=422998217:1:1808:131; _gid=A0CA96894E9D;
_u=4445534B544F502D534646394C4A46:6373696C7661:46353431423635424230383346354633;
__io=21_1181811818_1193560798_2439418475; _ga=1.591597.1635208534.1022;
_gat=10.0.22621.64

Cookie parameters for the HTTP GET request caused by this IcedID installer follow:

__gads= IcedID campaign identifier and information from the infected host.
_gid= Value calculated using MAC address of the infected host.
_u= ASCII text representing hex values of the victim’s hostname, Windows user account
name and another undetermined value.
__io= Domain identifier from the infected host’s security identifier (SID).
_ga= Information based on the infected host’s CPU.
_gat= Windows version. For example, 10.0.22621.64 is an identifier for 64-bit Windows 11
version 22H2 and 10.0.19045.64 is an identifier for 64-bit Windows 10 version 22H2.

10/22



These cookie parameters are unique to IcedID infections. You can identify this traffic as IcedID
without understanding the values. However, the _u= parameter reveals the victim’s hostname
and Windows user account name. This information is very useful for our investigation. These hex
values translate to a hostname of DESKTOP-SFF9LJF and a Windows user account name of
csilva, as shown below in Figure 10.

Figure 10.

Using the _u= cookie parameter to determine the victim’s hostname and Windows user account
name.
After retrieving the gzip binary, an IcedID installer creates persistent IcedID malware that takes
over the infection. The infected Windows host then starts generating HTTPS traffic to IcedID C2
servers.

These C2 servers use different domain names and IP addresses than the initial domain
contacted by the IcedID installer. IcedID’s HTTPS C2 traffic starts within a minute or two after the
installer retrieves the gzip binary, and this activity uses at least two domains with random
alphabetic names.

Our pcap reveals HTTPS traffic from the infected host to two domains after skigimeetroc[.]com at
15:35:39 UTC. These HTTPS C2 servers are askamoshopsi[.]com on 104.168.53[.]18 and
skansnekssky[.]com on 217.199.121[.]56.

To find these servers, use the same basic web filter with the victim’s IP address noted earlier in
Figure 5. HTTPS traffic starting at 15:36:41 UTC reveals these domains, as shown below in
Figure 11.

11/22



Figure 11. HTTPS C2 traffic after HTTP request by the IcedID installer.
Both C2 servers at askamoshopsi[.]com and skansnekssky[.]com use self-signed certificates for
their HTTPS traffic. Self-signed certificates for HTTPS traffic will generate warnings about
potential security risks when the site is viewed in any modern web browser.

Why do web browsers display warnings about websites that use self signed certificates?
Because these are not validated by a Certificate Authority. Criminals can generate self-signed
certificates that impersonate an existing company, or they can use generic values for the
certificate issuer. Without a validated certificate, web browsers cannot be sure a website is what
it says it is.

Figure 12 shows what the server at askamoshopsi[.]com looked like when we attempted to view
it with the Firefox web browser. This warning allows users to view the server’s self-signed
certificate.

12/22



Figure 12. Attempting to view the web server at askamoshopsi[.]com using Firefox.As shown
above in Figure 12, the certificate uses values like Internet Widgits Pty Ltd for the issuer’s
Organization name and Some-State for the State/Province name. Values for self-signed
certificates used by IcedID C2 servers are the same default values seen when using OpenSSL to
create a certificate in Xubuntu as shown below in Figures 13 and 14. 

Figure 13. Creating an x509 certificate for a web server using OpenSSL in Xubuntu. 

13/22



Figure 14. Default values when creating an x509 certificate for a web server using OpenSSL in
Xubuntu.
Since Internet Widgits Pty Ltd is a default value for a self-signed certificate in HTTPS traffic, and
this value is sometimes seen in C2 traffic for malware. This should be more closely examined if
it’s found when investigating a suspected malware infection. We can easily check any pcap for
this value using the following Wireshark filter:

x509sat.uTF8String eq "Internet Widgits Pty Ltd"

The results from our pcap reveal the same IP addresses used by IcedID C2 servers for
askamoshopsi[.]com at 104.168.53[.]18 and skansnekssky[.]com at 217.199.121[.]56. Expand
the frame details for any of the results to find the same certificate issuer data, as shown in Figure
15.

14/22



Figure 15. Self-signed certificate by IcedID C2 servers using Internet Widgits Pty Ltd as the
Organization name shown in Wireshark.
This certificate data is not unique to IcedID. The same values for self-signed certificates are also
seen in HTTPS C2 traffic by other malware families like Bumblebee.

Pcap Analysis: BackConnect Traffic
Undetected IcedID infections lead to follow-up activity like BackConnect traffic.

For the past several months, BackConnect traffic caused by IcedID was easy to detect because it
occurred over TCP port 8080. However, as early as April 11, 2023, BackConnect activity for
IcedID changed to TCP port 443, making it harder to find.

This BackConnect activity from IcedID Unit 42 tweeted on April 11, 2023 used an IP address of
193.149.176[.]100 over TCP port 443. Filter for that IP address in Wireshark and combine it with
tcp.flags eq 0x0002 as shown below, in Figure 16. This reveals the beginning of three streams.

15/22



Figure 16. Filtering in Wireshark for BackConnect traffic in our pcap.
Follow the TCP stream for the first result, which is TCP stream 950. This stream reveals encoded
or otherwise encrypted TCP traffic, as shown in Figure 17.

Figure 17. The first TCP stream for BackConnect activity.
Go back to the Wireshark filter used to reveal the TCP streams to 193.149.176[.]100. Follow the
TCP stream for the second frame in the results, which is TCP stream 951. This reveals encoded
or encrypted data followed by a command to reveal all hosts under the domain controller for
boogienights[.]live as shown below, in Figure 18.

16/22



Figure 18. BackConnect traffic with a command to and results enumerating the victim’s AD
environment.
The response to this command enumerates the victim’s AD environment, showing three clients
logged in to the domain:

DESKTOP-JAL4D68
DESKTOP-RETP4BU
DESKTOP-SFF9LJF

Go back to the Wireshark filter used to reveal the TCP streams to 193.149.176[.]100. Follow the
TCP stream for the last frame in the results, which is TCP stream 953. This lists disk drives on
the victim client, and it provides a directory listing for each of these drives, as shown below in
Figure 19.

The C:\ drive is the victim’s system drive. Z:\ is likely a mapped drive from a server’s shared
directory that does not contain any files.

17/22



Figure 19. BackConnect traffic showing contents of the victim’s system drive and mapped drive.
Previous IcedID infections reveal this threat can use BackConnect traffic to load and run Cobalt
Strike. We tweeted about one such case from March 24, 2023. However, this pcap does not
contain any indicators of Cobalt Strike.

Previous IcedID infections also reveal this threat can generate VNC traffic over the same IP
address used by BackConnect traffic. This happened during the same IcedID infection from
March 24, 2023.

Pcap Analysis: Victim Details
The common internal IP address for the malicious traffic we have reviewed is 10.4.19[.]136. This
is our victim’s IP address. To find the Windows user account name, filter on that IP address and
kerberos.CNameString as shown in Figure 20.

18/22



Figure 20. Finding the Windows user account name for our infected Windows host.
In some cases, lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) might also provide the full name of
the user. Use the following Wireshark filter:

ldap.AttributeDescription == "givenName"

This should provide four frames in our column display. Select any of them and expand the frame
details until you find the user’s full name, Cornelius Silva, as shown below in Figure 21.

19/22



Figure 21. Finding the victim’s full name from LDAP traffic.
Perhaps the easiest way to find a victim’s hostname in Wireshark is to combine the victim’s IP
address with a search for ip contains "DESKTOP-" as shown below, in Figure 22. Several results
in the info column show Host Announcement DESKTOP-SFF9LJF sent by our infected Windows
host at 10.4.19[.]136.

Figure 22. Finding the Windows hostname in Wireshark.
To find the victim’s MAC address, just correlate the IP address to the host’s MAC address in any
of the frame details windows, as shown below in Figure 23.

Conclusion
This blog provides answers and analysis for our Unit 42 Wireshark quiz featuring an IcedID
infection from April 2023. IcedID is important to identify and stop, because it is a known vector for
ransomware infections.

Many organizations lack access to full packet capture in their IT environment. As a result,
security professionals might lack experience reviewing IcedID and other malware traffic. Training
material like this Wireshark quiz can help. Pcap analysis is a useful skill that helps us better
understand malicious activity.
