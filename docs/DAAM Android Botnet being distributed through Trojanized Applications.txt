Botnet With Ransomware And Data Theft Capabilities
In recent years, the widespread use of Android devices has made them a prime target for cybercriminals. Android
botnet is a common malware type that cybercriminals use to gain access to targeted devices. These devices can be
controlled remotely to carry out various malicious activities.

Cyble Research & Intelligence Labs (CRIL) recently analyzed an Android Botnet shared by MalwareHunterTeam. The
mentioned malicious sample is the Trojanized version of the Psiphon application and identified as DAAM Android
Botnet, which provides below features:

Keylogger
Ransomware
VOIP call recordings
Executing code at runtime
Collects browser history
Records incoming calls
Steals PII data
Opens phishing URL
Capture photos
Steal clipboard data
Switch WiFi and Data status

The DAAM Android botnet provides an APK binding service wherein a Threat Actor (TA) can bind malicious code with a
legitimate app. CRIL analyzed an APK file named PsiphonAndroid.s.apk with the hash value of
“184356d900a545a2d545ab96fa6dd7b46f881a1a80ed134db1c65225e8fa902b” which contains DAAM botnet
malicious code bonded with a legitimate Psiphon application.

The malware connects to the Command and Control (C&C) server hxxp://192.99.251[.]51:3000, and the figure below
shows the DAAM Android botnet admin panel.

The C&C server is also present in various malicious applications, some of which were initially identified in August 2021.
This indicates that the DAAM Android botnet has been operational since 2021 and constantly targeting Android users.

Initially, the malware establishes a socket connection and communicates with the C&C server at
hxxp://192.99.251[.]51:3000 to obtain commands for carrying out a range of malicious activities, as depicted in the
figure below.

The DAAM Android botnet provides various command operations, which are explained below:

3/12



Keylogger:
Malware uses the Accessibility Service to monitor users’ activity. It saves the captured keystrokes along with the
application’s package name into a database, as shown in the figure below.

Figure 6 – Keylogger activity

Ransomware:
The DAAM botnet provides a Ransomware module that leverages the AES algorithm to encrypt and decrypt files on
the infected device. It retrieves the password required for encryption and decryption from the C&C server. The malware
also saves a ransom note in the “readme_now.txt” file.

The Ransomware activity is illustrated in the figure below.

VOIP call Recordings:
The DAAM botnet exploits the Accessibility service to monitor the components of social media applications such as
WhatsApp, Skype, Telegram, and many others responsible for VOIP calls. If the user interacts with the below-
mentioned components, malware initiates audio recording.

Below is the list of components targeted by the DAAM botnet:

Collecting Browser History:
The malware can gather bookmarks and browsing history stored on the target device and send them to the C&C
server, as depicted below.

Executing code at runtime:
The malware can execute the code at runtime using DexClassLoader by receiving the method name, class name, and
URL from the C&C server. The malware communicates with the received URL to fetch parameters of the targeted
method, which is responsible for executing other malicious activities. The dynamic code runner module is illustrated in
the below image.

Stealing PII data:
In addition to the functionalities mentioned above, the DAAM botnet gathers Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
from the infected device, including but not limited to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, files, basic device details, and
location data.

Opening URL:
Malware can receive a phishing URL from a C&C server, then load it into a WebView component to steal the victim’s
login information. The TA can use this feature to launch a social engineering attack by sending a phishing URL of their
choice from the C&C panel.

Collecting Screenshots:
The code in the below image is used by malware to steal screenshots saved at the external Storage path
“/Pictures/Screenshots” of an infected device and sends them to the C&C server.

Capturing Photos:
Additionally, the malware captures pictures by opening the camera of the victim’s device upon receiving a command
from the admin panel and subsequently sending pictures to the C&C server.

In addition to the main functionalities mentioned earlier, the DAAM botnet can carry out additional tasks such as
switching WiFi and data, showing random toast, and collecting clipboard data.

Conclusion
Malware authors often leverage genuine applications to distribute malicious code to avoid suspicion. DAAM Android
botnet also provides a similar APK binding service where TA can bind malicious code with a legitimate APK to appear
genuine.

Detailed analysis of the DAAM Android botnet indicates that it offers several intriguing capabilities, such as
Ransomware, runtime code execution, and Keylogger, among others. Although relatively fewer samples have been
identified so far, based on the malware’s capability, it may target a wide number of users in the coming days.
