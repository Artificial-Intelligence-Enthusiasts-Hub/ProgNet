Overview
A new attack campaign of SideCopy APT has been discovered targeting the Indian Defence
sector. The group utilizes phishing email attachments & URLs as the infection vector to
download malicious archive files leading to the deployment of two different Action RAT
payloads and a new .NET-based RAT. There are three infection chains with themes utilized:
DRDO’s “Invitation Performa,” which is part of its Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), a
honeytrap lure, and also the Indian Military with “Selection of Officers for Foreign
Assignments” theme.

The ongoing campaign came to light after a senior DRDO scientist was arrested for leaking
sensitive information to Pakistani agents who honey trapped him. “Honey Trap” has
increased significantly on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc., with
millions of illegitimate accounts used as bots or baits.

Similarly, in March 2023, the same infection chain was utilized targeting DRDO, with the
decoy theme being “HVAC Air Conditioning Design Basis Report” for its K4 Missile Clean
Room. Another theme used in the same month was “Advisory on Grant of Risk & Hardship
Allowance JCOs & ORs.” Even in April, they targeted Defence Ministry with the theme “Saudi
Arabia Delegation with Indian Armed Forces Medical Officials.”

SideCopy has been known for persistently targeting Indian Defence (Military and Armed
Forces) since its discovery in 2019.

Key Findings
Three infection chains lead to the same payloads hosted on the domain
elfinindia[.]com.
The infection chain is shown below, where an archive file contains a malicious shortcut
(LNK) file masqueraded as DOCX, PNG, and PDF, respectively. The LNK files trigger
MSHTA to execute remote HTA files on this domain.

Fig. 1 – Infection Process

The deployment of two variants of Action RAT and a new .NET-based RAT that
supports 18 C2 commands has been observed.

3/7



Action RAT downloads and executes a larger variant that exfiltrates all documents and
images inside the Desktop, Documents, and Download directories. The legitimate
‘credwiz.exe’ file is utilized to sideload both the RATs.
C2 infra has a known hostname commonly found, and all the TTPs directly point to
SideCopy’s known infection throughout the years.

Summary
This year, SideCopy has been actively targeting India, especially the defence sector. The
same attack chain targets victims in spear-phishing campaigns and honeytrap lures. As
Pakistani agents have increasingly used honey traps to lure defence personnel, one can only
anticipate the magnitude of damage it can cause. Hence, it is imperative to take the
necessary steps to end it. Pakistan and many other threat actors around the globe are using
honeytraps, with recent cases found stealing intelligence in this form of cyber espionage. An
in-depth analysis of the latest infection chain and a comparison with previous variants can be
found in our whitepaper.
