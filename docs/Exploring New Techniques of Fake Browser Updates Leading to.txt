Trellix detected an ongoing campaign using fake Chrome browser updates to lure victims to install a
remote administration software tool called NetSupport Manager. Malicious actors abuse this software to
steal information and take control of victim computers. The detected campaign has similarity with
previously reported SocGholish campaign, which was run by a suspected Russian threat actor. However,
the link to SocGholish is not conclusive, and there are differences in the tools used.

This blog will discuss the detected campaign and the tactics used to deliver the final payload to victims,
similarities, and differences with previously reported campaigns.

Joseph Tal, senior vice president of Trellix Advanced Research Center, said that “Chromium with 63.55%
of market share is now the de facto most targeted browser for NetSupport RAT attacks, due to the global
usage. Most large enterprise are using the Chromium browser as the main tool for web applications. I am
concerned about low efficacy endpoint solutions that are unable to detect the types of attacks. Board room
discussions should include this increasing attack surface as part of cyber’ discussions. Organisations need
holistic global threat intelligence and innovative security solutions to get the governance and tools needed
to reduce the cyber risk.”

Campaign overview
In late June 2023, the Trellix Advanced Research Center noticed a fake browser update campaign through
the detection of the first stage JavaScript downloader. The campaign uses compromised sites to present a
fake Chrome browser update to entice victims, leading them to install a remote administration software

tool (RAT) called NetSupport Manager.

The compromised websites are injected with a simple HTML script tag that loads JavaScript content from
the threat actor’s command and control server. The malicious script injection is likely automated and
follows a certain directory structure.

Figure 1. Injected code in a compromised Chamber of Commerce web site. 
Compromised sites may be identified by searching for the path, ‘/cdn-js/wds.min.php’. The success of this
campaign depends on the reach of the compromised website. From Trellix telemetry, we found a recent
compromise of a Chamber of Commerce website that has traffic from the Federal Government, financial
institutions, and consulting services. The site is already cleaned of the injected script and was
compromised for at least a day.

Figure 2. Fake browser update page. 
The injected script in the compromised website leads to a fake browser update page as in Figure 2. This
fake browser update theme leading to a NetSupport RAT is not new and was reported years ago. This lure
was also used by SocGholish , where it also leads to the installation of NetSupport RAT. However, there is
no conclusive evidence found to connect this current campaign to SocGholish.

The notable difference between the reported SocGholish campaign and the current one is in the tools
used. SocGholish used PowerShell with WMI functionality to download and install the RAT. By contrast,
this current campaign uses batch files (.BAT), VB scripts and the Curl tool instead of PowerShell scripts to
download components and the RAT payload. This is described in detail in the following section.

Technical details

Figure 3. Infection chain 
Clicking the Update Chrome link found in the fake browser update page leads to the download of a ZIP
archive, “UpdateInstall.zip”, which has an embedded malicious JavaScript file. The malicious script
named, “Browser_portable.js”, is a downloader of the next stage.

Figure 4. Relevant “Browser_portable.js” code to load second stage. 
In Figure 4, the file “Browser_portable.js” sends a request to the C2 to retrieve and execute yet another
malicious JavaScript code. The second stage JavaScript, “Chrome_update.js”, uses some obfuscation and
heavily padded with junk comment strings. Simplifying the code, we have Figure 5.

Figure 5. Simplified second stage malicious JavaScript, “Chrome_update.js”. 
The second stage script named, “Chrome_update.js”, is a downloader. It downloads a batch file, “1.bat”, in
the local ‘C://ProgramData’ folder and executes it.

Figure 6. “1.bat” uses 'curl' to download further components 
In Figure 6, the batch file “1.bat” drops VBScript and batch files. The VBScript files are still in development
or act as a dummy as it is noted that the “Wscrit.Arguments” is misspelled and the scripts are not
executed. By contrast, the batch files are executed and use “curl” to download further components. These
components are the portable 7-zip file archiver, NetSupport Manager RAT software package, and finally
the batch file, “2.bat”, to install and execute the RAT.

The NetSupport Manager RAT is extracted using the downloaded 7-zip utility and executed through
scheduled tasks in the victim computer by the downloaded “2.bat” file. This batch file is also responsible
for creating the persistence mechanism of the RAT to be executed upon system startup.

Looking at the configuration file of the RAT, “client32.ini”, the gateway address is set to 5.252.178.48. At
this point, in which the RAT is downloaded and installed in the victim computer, the threat actors have
gained almost complete control of the victim machine. They can now install more malware, exfiltrate data,
scan the network and move laterally.

Conclusion
Various threat actors may employ almost similar techniques in their attacks if those techniques work and
prove effective. In this campaign, we have observed that threat actors continue to actively use the lure of a
fake browser update, which had been utilized in different attacks.

The abuse of readily available RATs continues as these are powerful tools capable of fulfilling the
adversaries’ needs to carry out their attacks and achieve their objectives. While these RATs may not be
constantly updated, the tools and techniques to deliver these payloads to potential victims will continue to
evolve.

Threat actors continually update their TTPs to evade detection. They use available tools in the target
environment to avoid unnecessary download and creation of custom components. They also use text-
based or scripting languages that can be obfuscated in different ways, posing a challenge in creating static
detection. In this campaign, a combination of native Windows OS scripting languages such as VBScript
and Batch script were used together, along with the popular data transfer tool, curl, which has been
available in Windows since 2017.
