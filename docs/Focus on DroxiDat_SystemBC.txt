Unknown Actor Targets Power Generator with DroxiDat and Cobalt
Strike
Recently we pushed a report to our customers about an interesting and common component
of the cybercrime malware set – SystemBC. And, in much the same vein as the 2021
Darkside Colonial Pipeline incident, we found a new SystemBC variant deployed to a critical
infrastructure target. This time, the proxy-capable backdoor was deployed alongside Cobalt
Strike beacons in a south African nation’s critical infrastructure.

Kim Zetter closely reviewed the preceding Colonial Pipeline incident in her BlackHat 2022
keynote “Pre-Stuxnet, Post-Stuxnet: Everything Has Changed, Nothing Has Changed”,
calling it a “watershed moment”. We are now seeing targeting and tactical similarities
elsewhere in the world.

A lot of abstract content and interesting trend analysis has been published about industrial
ransomware attacks “The second quarter of 2023 proved to be an exceptionally active period
for ransomware groups, posing significant threats to industrial organizations and
infrastructure”, but very little technical detail in the way of particular electric utility
ransomware incidents has been publicly reported. We know that surveyed utilities, on a

1/6



global basis, are reporting more and more in the way of targeted activity and higher risk:
“56% [of respondents] report at least one attack involving a loss of private information or an
outage in the OT environment in the past 12 months”. While not all of the activity is attributed
to ransomware actors, perhaps the relevant ransomware attackers are avoiding retaliation by
strong government agencies and alliances, while continuing to act on a game plan that
demonstrated previous successes. Regardless, this increased utilities targeting is a real
world problem with serious potential consequences, especially in areas where network
outages may affect customers on a country-wide basis.

Notably, an unknown actor targeted an electric utility in southern Africa with Cobalt Strike
beacons and DroxiDat, a new variant of the SystemBC payload. We speculate that this
incident was in the initial stages of a ransomware attack. This attack occurred in the third and
fourth week of March 2023, as a part of a small wave of attacks involving both DroxiDat and
CobaltStrike beacons across the world. DroxiDat, a lean ~8kb variant of SystemBC serving
as a system profiler and simple SOCKS5-capable bot, was detected in the electric utility. The
C2 infrastructure for this electric utility incident involved an energy-related domain
“powersupportplan[.]com” that resolved to an already suspicious IP host. This host was
previously used several years prior as a part of an APT activity, raising the potential for an
APT-related targeted attack. While our interest was piqued, a link to that previous APT was
never established, and was likely unrelated. Ransomware was not delivered to the
organization, and we do not have enough information to precisely attribute this activity.
However, in a healthcare related incident involving DroxiDat around the same timeframe,
Nokoyawa ransomware was delivered, along with several other incidents involving
CobaltStrike sharing the same license_id and staging directories, and/or C2.

DroxiDat/SystemBC Technical Details
The DroxiDat/SystemBC payload component is interesting in its own right as a changing,
malicious backdoor, often used as a part of ransomware incidents. Multiple “types” of
SystemBC have been publicly catalogued. The SystemBC platform has been offered for sale
on various underground forums at least since 2018 as a “malware as a service,” or MaaS.
This platform is made up of three separate parts: on the server side, a C2 web server with
admin panel and a C2 proxy listener; on the target side is a backdoor payload. Regarding an
earlier SystemBC variant, other researchers have stated that “SystemBC is an attractive tool
in these types of operations because it allows for multiple targets to be worked at the same
time with automated tasks, allowing for hands-off deployment of ransomware using Windows
built-in tools if the attackers gain the proper credentials.”

This DroxiDat variant is very compact compared to previous and common 15-30kb+
SystemBC variants. Detected SystemBC objects going back to at least 2018 (a SystemBC
executable compiled in July 2017 was observed) have numbered in the thousands and were
used by a long list of ransomware affiliates. In fact, it appears that most of the functionality

provided in previous SystemBC payloads was stripped from its codebase, and the purpose
of this DroxiDat malware variant is a simple system profiler – its file name suggests its use
case as “syscheck.exe”. It provides no download-and-execute capabilities, but can connect
with remote listeners and pass data back and forth, and modify the system registry. Also
interesting, within this power generator network, DroxiDat/systemBC was detected
exclusively on system assets similar to past DarkSide targets. And, a Darkside affiliate hit
Electrobras and Copel energy companies in Brazil in 2021. The combination of C:\perflogs
for storage with DroxiDat/SystemBC and CobaltStrike executable objects was used in past
Egregor and Ryuk incidents as well.

File type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows

File size 8192 bytes

File path C:\perflogs\syscheck.exe

Two instances of this DroxiDat malware appeared in C:\perflogs alongside two Cobalt Strike
beacons on multiple systems.
Essentially, this variant provide s several functions:

Retrieves active machine name/username, local IP and volume serial information.
Instead of creating an exclusive-use mutex, it checks and then creates a new thread
and registers a window, class “Microsoft” and text “win32app” (included in all variants of
systemBC).
Simple xor decrypts its C2 (IP:port) settings and creates a session to the remote host.
Encrypts and sends collected system information to the C2.
May create and delete registry keys and values.

Missing from this Windows variant that is common to past variants:

File creation capability.
File-execution switch statement, parsing for hardcoded file extensions (vbs, cmd, bat,
exe, ps1) and code execution functionality.
Mini-TOR client capabilities.
Emisoft anti-malware scan.

The object contains xor-encoded configuration settings:

HOST 1: 93.115.25.41

 
HOST2: 192.168.1.28

So in this case, its immediate C2 destination is 93.115.25.41:443
Up until November 2022, this IP host provided bitcoin services. O wnership likely changed in
December 2022, as the above backdoor was compiled mid-December.
A second DroxiDat executable was sent down to the same systems wit h capabilities to add
executable entries to the “Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” registry key with
a “socks5” entry, i.e.:

1 powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -Command "c:\perflogs\hos.exe"

A third DroxiDat object, this time a dll, was sent down to a server.

It implements essentially the same functionality as “syscheck.exe” above without the ability
to modify the registry. It also maintains the same HOST and PORT values, and 40-byte key.

Cobalt Strike beacons and related infrastructure
Cobalt Strike beacons were detected on these systems as well, located in the same directory
and similar infrastructure. In a couple of instances, the beacons arrived and were detected
on the same day as DroxiDat. In several instances, a couple of the beacons first arrived and
were detected in the same perflogs directory two days later, and several more six days later.
It’s highly likely that the same attackers maintained access via stolen credentials or another
unknown method.

The beacons’ infrastructure was power-utility themed:
powersupportplan[.]com, 179.60.146.6

 
URL: /rs.css, /skin

Several beacons calling back to this C2 included the same license_id value:
"license_id": "0x282d4156"  

We identified one other Cobalt Strike C2 server and beacon cluster, possibly spoofing a
power-utility theme as well, along with other related data points: epowersoftware[.]com,
194.165.16.63.

The ssh server on this epowersoftware host shares the same ssh version and RSA key(s)
with the one at powersupportplan[.]com. Additionally, the CS beacon calling back to this
domain maintains the same license_id, as seen above: “license_id”: “0x282d4156”.

Attribution
We have a consistent set of data points across multiple incidents mentioned in our private
report, helping suggest an assessment may be made with low confidence. Several of these
suggest this activity may be attributed to Russian-speaking RaaS cybercrime. In this case,
we may be looking at an activity from a group known as Pistachio Tempest or FIN12, a group
HHS reported “has specifically targeted the healthcare industry” in 2022, frequently
deploying SystemBC alongside CS Beacon to deploy ransomware:

Consistent use of the same perflogs staging directory across this intrusion set within an
early 2023 timeframe.
SystemBC consistently paired alongside Cobalt Strike.
Shared profile data across Cobalt Strike hosts.
Nokoyawa ransomware deployment alongside DroxiDat within a health care
organization early 2023.

More details can be found in our private crimeware intelligence report “Focus on
DroxiDat/SystemBC – Unknown Actor Targets Power Generator with DroxiDat and
CobaltStrike” released in June 2023.
