Report

document and enables macros, it triggers the execution of malicious code, allowing
SideCopy to gain initial access. The malware used is a new version of ReverseRAT, which
has enhanced obfuscation and sleep calls to avoid detection.
Once ReverseRAT gains persistence, it enumerates the victim 's device, collects data,

encrypts it using RC4, and sends it to the Command and Control (C2) server. It waits for
commands to execute on the target machine, and some of its functions include taking
screenshots, downloading and executing files, and uploading files to the C2 server.
