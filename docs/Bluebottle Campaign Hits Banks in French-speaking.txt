Countries in Africa

Threat Hunter TeamSymantec

Bluebottle, a cyber-crime group that specializes in targeted attacks against the financial sector,
is continuing to mount attacks on banks in Francophone countries. The group makes extensive
use of living off the land, dual-use tools, and commodity malware, with no custom malware
deployed in this campaign.

The activity observed by Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software, appears to be a
continuation of activity documented in a Group-IB report from November 2022. The activity
documented by Group-IB spanned from mid-2019 to 2021, and it said that during that period
this group, which it called OPERA1ER, stole at least $11 million in the course of 30 targeted
attacks.

Similarities in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between the activity documented
by Group-IB and the activity seen by Symantec include:

1/9



Same domain seen in both sets of activity: personnel[.]bdm-sa[.]fr
Some of the same tools used: Ngrok; PsExec; RDPWrap; Revealer Keylogger; Cobalt
Strike Beacon
No custom malware found in either set of activity
The crossover in targeting of French-speaking nations in Africa
Both sets of activity also feature the use of industry-specific, and region-specific, domain
names

While this does appear to be a continuation of the activity documented by Group-IB, the activity
seen by Symantec is more recent, running from at least July 2022 to September 2022, though
some of the activity may have begun as far back as May 2022. Some new TTPs have also
been employed in recent attacks, including:

Some indications the attackers may have used ISO files as an initial infection vector
The use of the commodity malware GuLoader in the initial stages of the attack
Indications the attackers have adopted the technique of abusing kernel drivers to disable
defenses

Attack chain
The initial infection vector is unknown, but the earliest malicious files found on victim networks
had French-language, job-themed file names. These likely acted as lures. In some cases, the
malware was named to trick the user into thinking it was a PDF file, e.g.:

fiche de poste.exe ("job description")
fiche de candidature.exe ("application form")
fiche de candidature.pdf.exe ("application form")

It’s most likely these files were delivered to victims via a spear-phishing email, which would
align with the initial infection vector documented by Group-IB for the OPERA1ER activity.

Although the majority of the activity observed by Symantec researchers began in July 2022, at
least one victim was found to have an infostealer with a similar naming theme on its network as
early as mid-May 2022. In that case, the malware arrived in the form of a ZIP file containing an
executable SCR file.

fiche de candidature(1).zip (ZIP file)
fiche de candidature.scr  (executable SCR file)

The file is an older, likely commodity, malware. It's difficult to determine when it was used to
target the organization. It is, however, consistent with infection vectors reported as used by
OPERA1ER in 2021.

2/9



However, the job-themed malware in July was observed in paths suggesting it had been
mounted as CD-ROMs. This could indicate a genuine disc was inserted, but it could also be
that a malicious ISO file was delivered to victims and mounted. An ISO file is an archive file that
contains an identical copy or image of the data that would be found on an optical disc.
Malicious ISO files have been used as an initial infection vector in other campaigns in 2022,
including being used alongside the Bumblebee loader in a campaign where delivering
ransomware was the ultimate goal. If the Bluebottle and OPERA1ER actors are indeed one and
the same, this would mean that they swapped out their infection techniques between May and
July 2022. ISO files were not seen in the activity documented by Group-IB.

In many cases, the job-themed malware delivered to victims was the commodity loader called
GuLoader. GuLoader is a shellcode-based downloader with anti-analysis features. In addition
to malicious files, the loader deploys some legitimate binaries as a decoy for its malicious
activity. GuLoader was distributed to victims in a self-extracting NSIS executable. This NSIS
script decrypts and injects obfuscated shellcode into another process. The process most often
observed in the July activity was ieinstal.exe, the Internet Explorer Add-on Installer, but also
included aspnet_regbrowsers.exe, the ASP.NET Browser Registration tool.

The process for the Internet Explorer Add-on Installer was likely used to download a malicious
.NET downloader from URLs such as hxxp://178.73.192[.]15/ca1.exe. Multiple .NET
downloaders were found that abused the file transfer service transfer[.]sh to download a file
named with an RTF extension. This payload is unknown, but the downloaders are designed to
load it as a .NET DLL.

After GuLoader and the .NET loaders were deployed, various other post-compromise tools
were seen on victim networks. These include the publicly available Netwire remote access
Trojan (RAT) and the open-source Quasar RAT. The attackers also used the commercial post-
compromise tool Cobalt Strike Beacon. The Cobalt Strike Beacon variant used by Bluebottle
employed an API hammering technique in order to hamper analysis. 

Use of a signed driver to kill processes
A set of malware was also deployed by the attackers that had the likely goal of disabling the
security products on victim networks. The malware consisted of two components, a controlling
DLL that reads a list of processes from a third file, and a signed 'helper' driver controlled by the
first driver and used to terminate the processes in the list.

Attackers used Windows Service Control (sc.exe) to load the driver:

sc create fgt binPath= %TEMP%\fgt.sys type= kernel

sc start fgt

3/9



In August 2022, Symantec observed the same driver being used in suspected pre-ransomware
attack activity against a non-profit in Canada. Another tool found on the victim network was
Infostealer.Eamfo, a hacktool that has been associated with Cuba, Noberus, and Lockbit
ransomware attacks.

The same driver also appears to have been used by multiple groups for similar purposes.
Mandiant documented a financially motivated threat group it calls UNC3944 using this same
driver to disable defenses. It referred to this driver as POORTRY and the malware that uses it
as STONESTOP. However, Mandiant did note at the time that “POORTRY appears across
different threat groups and is consistent with malware available for purchase or shared freely
between different groups.”

Sophos also documented an instance where Cuba ransomware operators used a loader called
BURNTCIGAR to load signed drivers to kill defenses. The loader operates similarly to the
malicious DLL seen in this activity.

These drivers were reported to Microsoft by other vendors, and the company suspended the
developer accounts and added defenses to address them.

The short-term goal of Bluebottle in this recent activity appears in part to be persistence and
credential theft. The actors used credential theft techniques and tools, such as modifying the
WDigest setting and deploying Mimikatz, as well as an open-source fake login screen
keylogger.

For lateral movement, the attackers deployed the penetration testing tool SharpHound for
domain trust enumeration and executed additional files across the victim organizations using
PsExec.

For persistence, evidence suggests the attackers added additional accounts using the 'net
localgroup /add' command. They also deployed an open-source RDPWrap script to enable
multiple concurrent RDP sessions on victim systems. This script also modifies the registry and
opens port 3389 on the firewall to allow RDP traffic through.

Indications are that this activity was likely “hands-on-keyboard” activity rather than automated.
While we do not see what further activity is carried out by the attackers, the victims and the
crossover with the activity documented by Group-IB all indicate that this activity is likely
financially motivated.

Victims
Three different financial institutions in three African nations were compromised in the activity
seen by Symantec, with multiple machines infected in all three organizations.

The activity on one of the infected institution’s networks ran as follows:

4/9



The first activity was seen in mid-July 2022, when job-themed malware was spotted on the
infected system. A downloader was then deployed, before the Sharphound hacktool was
detected and a tool called fakelogonscreen was also deployed.

About three weeks after the initial compromise of the network, the attackers were seen using a
command prompt and PsExec for lateral movement. It appears the attackers were “hands on
keyboard” at this point of the attack. The attackers used various dual-use and living-off-the-land
tools for numerous purposes, including:

Quser for user discovery
Ping for checking internet connectivity
Ngrok for network tunneling
Net localgroup /add for adding users
Fortinet VPN client - likely for a secondary access channel
Xcopy to copy RDP wrapper files
Netsh to open port 3389 in the firewall
The Autoupdatebat 'Automatic RDP Wrapper installer and updater' tool to enable multiple
concurrent RDP sessions on a system
SC privs to modify SSH agent permissions - this could have been tampering for key theft
or installation of another channel

Malicious tools used included:

GuLoader
Mimikatz
Revealer Keylogger
Backdoor.Cobalt
Netwire RAT
The malicious DLL and driver for killing processes

Multiple other unknown files were also deployed on this network. The last activity seen on this
network was in September 2022, but the Ngrok tunneling tool remained on the network until
November 2022.

Some of the same tools were also deployed on the other victims, with GuLoader seen in all
three victims. Other activity linking the activity in all three victims includes:

Same .NET downloader
Malicious driver used
At least one overlapping transfer[.]sh URL

Conclusion

5/9



While Symantec cannot confirm whether or not Bluebottle successfully monetized the
campaigns we saw it carrying out, the group’s success at monetizing its activity between 2019
and 2021, as documented by Group-IB, indicates that this group has had a significant amount
of success in the past.

The effectiveness of its campaigns means that Bluebottle is unlikely to stop this activity. It
appears to be very focused on Francophone countries in Africa, so financial institutions in these
countries should remain on high alert for the activity documented in this blog. The attackers
appear to be French-speaking, so the possibility of them expanding this activity to French-
speaking nations in other regions also cannot be ruled out.

Glossary of tools mentioned
