Don't ask me what crypters to use, I cannot give feedback for any crypter as I have never
bought one. If you find a native crypter, ask the developer if his crypter is compatible with
Gaudox. don't use crypters with dependencies. I will code a native crypter soon.

 

Gaudox HTTP

Gaudox is a HTTP loader completely coded from scratch in C/C++ language with a few lines
of Assembly, which means that it does not require of any dependencies ( C-Runtime, NET
Framework, Java VM ). The bot has been fully tested and working on all Windows versions
from Windows XP SP2 to Windows 10 (32/64-bit). It is also worth mentioning that I coded
this bot with very efficient and stable designed code to handle thousands of connections at
once.

 

Features:

 

Usermode Rootkit

1/5



Bot has Rootkit functionality which hides all bot resources and prevents from being accessed
from explorer process. This feature does not drop any to disk, the code is internally
embedded in the bot file and injected in the target process from memory. It is also has self-
protection that prevents the hooks from being removed by third-party programs or any
security tool. This feature is currently working on 32-bit systems.

 

Persistence/Watchdog

Bot prevents it from being removed from the system by bot killers, security tools or user
actions. This feature is currently supporting process protection and working on both 32/64-bit
systems but its maximum compatibility is in 32-bit.

 

Traffic Encrypted

The communication between the bot and the control panel is obfuscated. This prevents
middle attacks.

 

Anti-Analysis/Research

Bot contains several methods for preventing from being analyzed by researchers or
unauthorized users. some methods are from preventing static analysis by obfuscating code,
data up to detect the presence of debuggers, avoid running the bot in virtualized
environments, etc. some methods may not be mentioned.

How to install:

1) Open the Builder and create a new profile, you will use these values KEY #1 and KEY #2
in the panel.

2) Create a new database (recommended)

2) Open setup.php with browser and complete the form.

3) Delete setup.php and open login.php with browser.

5) When creating the bot clients do not forget to use the same profile you used to install the
panel, otherwise the bots will not connect to the panel.

 

Notes:

 

1) I highly recommend disabling strict mode in MySQL.

2) I f you test the bot from a local server, the panel may be showing "US" in location, it's not
an error, the panel expects to always get an external IP.

How to update:

 

1.1.0.0 to 1.1.0.1+

You will need to install the panel again, sorry for the inconvenience. The database is now the
final version and it would be compatible with all future versions ( I hope, unless I have
forgotten something or want to add a new feature, in any case I will code a script to update
the database ).
