BlueShell Used in APT Attacks Against Korean and Thai
Targets

By Sanseo September 11, 2023

BlueShell is a backdoor developed in Go. It is available on GitHub and supports Windows,
Linux, and Mac operating systems. Currently, it seems the original GitHub repository has
been deleted, but the BlueShell source code can be downloaded from other repositories.
Notably, the ReadMe file containing the guidelines is in Chinese, and this suggests that the
creator may be a Chinese speaker.

There aren’t many cases where BlueShell is known to have been used in the attacks unlike
SparkRAT, Silver C2, or other malware published on GitHub. However, examining attack
cases in Korea shows that a variety of threat actors are continuously using BlueShell in their

attacks.

AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) is monitoring APT attack cases using
BlueShell. In this post, we will provide a summary of such cases. The attack cases that have
been identified by AhnLab are mostly those that targeted Windows systems of Korean
companies. However, attacks against Linux systems include cases where not only Korean
but Thai broadcasting companies were also targeted.

 
1. BlueShell
One of the main characteristics of BlueShell is that it was developed in Go. Because of the
many advantages of the Go language including the fact that it is easy to develop with and
offers cross-platform support, it is used often to not only develop applications but also create
malware. SparkRAT included in a Korean VPN installer [1] and Sliver C2 used in the attack
campaign exploiting the vulnerability in Sunlogin, a Chinese remote control utility [2] are both
malware developed in Go and published on GitHub. Besides these, there have been a
growing number of cases where APT threat groups used Go to create malware; the Kimsuky
threat group developed a downloader that installs Meterpreter, [3] the RedEyes (APT37)
threat group developed a backdoor by abusing the Ably service, [4] and the Andariel threat
group developed a variety of malware including 1th Troy reverse shell, Black RAT, Goat RAT,
and Durian Beacon. [5]

In terms of features, BlueShell is a backdoor with a simple structure. It supports TLS
encryption in communications with the C2 server and bypasses network detection. Features
that can be run according to the commands from the threat actor include remote command
execution, file download/upload, and Socks5 proxy.

BlueShell has three configuration data: the IP address of the C2 server, the port number, and
the wait time. Ordinarily, these are hard-coded into the binary when the malware is created,
and the init() function initializes the configuration data.

2.1. Attack Cases of the Dalbit Threat Group
The Dalbit group is a threat group based in China. The group usually targets vulnerable
servers to breach information including internal data from companies or encrypts files and
demands money. [6] Their targets of attack are usually Windows servers that are poorly
managed or are not patched to the latest version. Besides these, there are also attack cases
that targeted email servers or MS-SQL database servers.

The Dalbit group is known for using open-source tools in most stages of their attack from
initial infiltration, privilege escalation, internal reconnaissance, to lateral movement, until their
goals are achieved. The malware used in the actual command and control stages are also
publicly available tools such as CobaltStrike, Metasploit, Ladaon, and BlueShell.

Out of the various attack cases, here, we will cover the case where BlueShell was collected
during the attack process. While it has not been confirmed whether the threat actor used
BlueShell in the actual attack, the BlueShell malware with the default C2 server set in the
original source code was collected during the attack process. The collected files have x86
and x64 architectures. The source code information in the binary and the time they were
collected by VirusTotal allows us to assume that these files were probably included in the
collection of attack tools used by the threat actor.

/root/pentesttools/BlueShell/client.go

In attacks against web servers, the Dalbit threat group usually exploits the WebLogic or file
upload vulnerability to upload web shells. Various JSP web shell files were also found in this
attack case.

In the internal reconnaissance stage, the threat actor used the Lsass dump tool to steal
account credentials and used the fscan tool to scan the internal network. It is presumed that
the collected information would have been used for lateral movement using the Impacket
tool.

The most prominent characteristic of the Dalbit group is that it uses Fast Reverse Proxy
(FRP) as the proxy tool. In the attack process, the Frpc tool, its configuration file, and
another proxy tool by the name of Venom [7] were used.

2.2. Attack Against a Korean Corporation
Although the case above was not one where BlueShell was used in its normal way in the
attack process, a case of attack against a Korean corporation using BlueShell was later
identified. Due to a lack of relevant information, the initial attack vector or whether the threat
actor is the same one as the Dalbit group of the past could not be ascertained, but it is
notable that BlueShell and Frpc were used together in the attack.

Examining the source code information in the binary shows that the threat actor likely
created BlueShell in a Windows environment. Two versions of BlueShell were identified in
the attack process; while both communicate with the same C2 server, one is obfuscated.

D:/skens/SK/BlueShell-master/client.go

The Frpc used in the attack is also obfuscated, and instead of being the default format of
Frpc, it is a version customized by the threat actor. Ordinarily, Frpc reads and loads
configuration data in file format, but the Frpc used in the attack decodes the encoded
configuration data in the memory area during execution.

3. Linux Version

3.1. Cases of Attack Presumed to Have Targeted Korea and Thailand
BlueShell, developed in Go, offers cross-platform support and thus can run not only in
Windows environments but also in Linux systems. While monitoring BlueShell targeting Linux
environments, ASEC identified customized types of BlueShell from VirusTotal. As they were
uploaded to VirusTotal from Korea and Thailand, it seems that the two areas were the targets
of attack.

The threat actor first created a dropper and used this to install BlueShell. The dropper is
responsible for creating and executing BlueShell like ordinary droppers, but the difference
here is that upon execution, an environment variable by the name “lgdt” is configured and
executed. The created BlueShell finds the “lgdt” environment variable, decodes it, and uses it
as the C2 server URL. Thus, BlueShell by itself cannot find the C2 server URL.

 
A. Analysis of the dropper
During the execution process, the dropper Xor-decrypts BlueShell saved in the internal .data
section with the 0x63 key. The decrypted data is in compressed form, and it is decompressed
and copied into the “/tmp/kthread” path.

Figure 7.

The dropper’s main routine
After “/tmp/kthread” (BlueShell malware) is executed, it deletes itself, so BlueShell only runs
in the memory area. The dropper has two other characteristics. The first is that the argument
“/sbin/rpcd” is transmitted when BlueShell is run and changes the name of the running
process into “/sbin/rpcd” to disguise it. As such, the name of the disguised process is visible
in the ps command or “/proc/[pid]/cmdline”.

8. Changed process name
It is also notable that when the created BlueShell is run, the environment variable “lgdt” is
configured before execution. Thus, the “lgdt” environment variable
“MjAuMjE0LjIwMS4xNjYgNDQzIDE1” is given as an argument for the sys_execve system
call, and the child process BlueShell executed accordingly also receives this environment
variable.

B. Analysis of customized BlueShell
The BlueShells used in the attacks have the same features aside from a few notable points.
Instead of having configuration data such as the C2 server URL or the port number in the
binary, a certain environment variable is read and decrypted to obtain said data. In the case
above, the dropper configured the environment variable “lgdt” before executing BlueShell,
and therefore the environment variable was inherited. BlueShell decodes the environment
variable “lgdt” with Base64 and uses this as configuration data.

Figure 10. Routine that decrypts environment variables and uses them as configuration data
In the attack case in Korea covered above, three arguments are found after decoding with
Base64. These are the C2 server URL, port number, and wait time.

8/11



Decrypted environment variable: 20.214.201[.]166 443 15

The BlueShell uploaded from Thailand is created in the path “/tmp/.ICECache”. When the
environment variable is decoded, four pieces of data can be identified. The values are the
same for up to the third configuration data. The fourth is used to distinguish between infected
systems. The customized BlueShell uses the hostname() function to obtain the host name of
the currently running system and runs only when this value matches the fourth data.

It is difficult to pinpoint the attack targets using only the host name of the infected system, but
the host name of the decoded string is the same as one of the broadcasting companies in
Thailand. The country that uploaded to VirusTotal and the malware’s conditions for infected
systems show that this threat group possibly launched an APT attack against targets in
Thailand.

Table 2. Configuration data of the customized BlueShell
Additionally, the BlueShells used in attack cases in both Korea and Thailand were built in the
Go language environment version 1.18.4. Through the following source code information, it
can be inferred that attacks would have been ongoing from at least September 2022.

4. Conclusion
Being a backdoor, BlueShell can receive commands from the threat actor to perform actions
in the infected system, such as command execution, file download/upload, and Socks5
proxy. As it is developed in Go, Linux environments can also become targets of attack along
with Windows environments. Various threat actors are using it in attacks because it is
available on GitHub as an open source.

To prevent such security threats, vulnerable settings must be reviewed, relevant systems
must always be kept upgraded to the latest version to protect them against attacks. Also, V3
should be updated to the latest version so that malware infection can be prevented.
