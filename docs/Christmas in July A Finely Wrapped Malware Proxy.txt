Christmas in July: A Finely Wrapped Malware Proxy
Service

It is not often that Spur has the opportunity to glean full insight into a malware proxy service.
Because we track hundreds of proxy and VPN services, our focus is generally on the proxies
from a network standpoint rather than any related malware or its provenance. Even rarer do
we get awareness into the actor(s) operating a malware network facilitating the proxy
service.

But thanks to a recent article from Black Lotus Labs, and with the help of Brian Krebs’s
investigative reporting, Christmas has come early this year at Spur.

The Disappearance
A few weeks ago, we noticed a few key metrics and details associated with SocksEscort —
one of the oldest malware proxy services we track — suddenly change. The amount of
proxies we had insight into plummeted, and the communicating infrastructure seemingly
moved.

Around July 11, we started noticing a significant downward trend in the number of available
endpoints. The count of available endpoints for a given service tends to ebb and flow but this
halving of the online proxy count merited a closer look.

The proxy control servers appeared to still be online based on the indicators we use to track
them. The below is a screenshot from driftnet.io, an excellent infrastructure profiling service
showing a seemingly still-active SocksEscort control server after the decrease in proxy

counts.

However, around the same time, we also saw the count of victims per server (as shown for
June in the figure below) drop to 0.

Server         Victim Count 
155.254.23.254 7506 
139.59.231.113 6792 
188.138.41.157 167 
85.25.214.74 129 
85.25.217.95 129 
148.72.155.187 107 
148.72.155.189 107 
148.72.155.112 96 
50.30.36.132 96 
148.72.155.174 95 
50.30.36.27 93 
69.64.55.106 69

It is not uncommon for the actors operating a malware proxy service to push a code update
or rotate their infrastructure, but up until this point, SocksEscort had always been stable. We
were mostly blind; nothing about the service itself appeared to have changed. A frustrating
result of focusing our efforts on tracking the proxy service at the network level rather than the
malware itself at a broader threat intelligence level is that we’re frequently left to only guess
at the explanations for these kinds of events.

The Takedown

2/4



Purely coincidentally while perusing LinkedIn, I came across interesting research done by
Danny Adamitis and Steve Rudd of Black Lotus Labs, the threat intelligence arm of Lumen
(formerly known as CenturyLink). The specific article, posted just a few weeks ago on July
12, dives deep into a piece of SOHO-based malware they are calling AVrecon. Instead of
rehashing the article, I highly recommend reading it. It would do it an injustice to try to
summarize it.

Whenever I read similar research posts by other organizations, I’m curious to figure out what
(if any) call-back proxy service is tied to the malware as residential proxies tend to be a
popular monetization vector for malware operators. It only took a brief overview of the full
IoCs published by Black Lotus Labs to identify SocksEscort as the malware proxy service
tied to this particular botnet based on the C2 infrastructure.

The smoking gun was in Lumen’s remediation as mentioned in the conclusion of the above
article: black hole-ing the IP addresses belonging to the stage 2 C2 infrastructure for
AVrecon. Assuming Lumen null-routed the control servers sometime shortly before their
research team published their article on July 12, we finally had a clear picture as to the
reason behind the plummeting proxy numbers for SocksEscort.

The Other Side
As previously mentioned, Spur focuses on tracking a massive breadth of proxies and tunnel
services at a network level. We tend to stop short of identifying any potential related malware
and its particularities, as it falls outside our bailiwick. Likewise, we also tend not to track the
actors operating these botnets and associated services, deferring this tall order to the likes of
Brian Krebs and other investigative journalists and threat intelligence specialists in the
security space.

Indeed, Krebs wrote about SocksEscort shortly after the 911.re takedown took place
(SocksEscort was a front-runner for a 911 replacement). He’s recently published another
article examining the potential actors ultimately behind the malware proxy service, linking it
to an individual as well as a commercial VPN service. Again, instead of attempting to
summarize the findings, the article merits its own read.

The Village
Black Lotus Labs and Krebs have been simultaneously investigating the same malware, just
from different angles. Our unique insight into malware proxy networks was the missing link
connecting their separate research.

And so now a full picture is painted of SocksEscort, tying together the malware itself, with the
service profiting from the infections (perhaps one of many), to the proxy operators.

The security community is filled with experts like Krebs and the smart people at Lumen’s
research wing. Sometimes it takes a few organizations to piece together the puzzle. Spur
greatly appreciates the work done by groups like Black Lotus Labs that can better identify
and track the malware associated with these services. Additionally, their remediation efforts
have put a serious strain on SocksEscort and vastly dropped their available proxy inventory.

If you or your organization have interesting research to share that may concern malware
proxies, we’d love to hear from you!
