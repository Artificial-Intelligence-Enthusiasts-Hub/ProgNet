AtomSilo Ransomware Enters the League of Double
Extortion

zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/atomsilo-ransomware-enters-league-double-extortion

Ransomware is used widely in cyberattacks to disrupt the victim's organization. Over the
last two years, many attackers have evolved their ransomware tactics to include data
exfiltration. This tactic is known as "double-extortion": attackers demand ransom for the
data decryption in addition to the ransom to prevent public release of the stolen data.
ThreatLabz monitors these threat actors and analyzes the attack sequences of double
extortion attacks. AtomSilo is a new player on the scene, and in this blog, we'll break down
the details of their attacks.

Introduction
AtomSilo ransomware emerged around September 2021, with their tactics including
exfiltrating and publishing their first victim's data.

We'll break down one of their attacks, which started with initial access through exploiting a
vulnerability in Atlassian’s Confluence collaboration software. The ransomware operators
planted a back door using legitimate software via a dll side loading technique. The backdoor
allowed remote code execution of Windows Shell commands through WMI (Windows
Management Interface), which operators exploited using compromised administrative
accounts before dropping AtomSilo.

Technical Analysis

1/9



The AtomSilo payload is 64-bit and packed with a modified UPX packer. Once executed, it
enumerates each drive and drops a ransom note in each folder except the few listed in
Table1. The ransom note is named “README-FILE-{COMPUTER_Name}-{DateTime}.hta”.

It enumerates each file and encrypts all folders and files EXCEPT those that contain the
below names:

Folder name File name
Boot autorun.inf

Windows index.html

Windows.old boot.ini

Tor Browser bootfont.bin

Internet Explorer bootsect.bak

Google bootmgr

It also does not encrypt files with the following extensions:

.hta .idx

.hlp .ini

.html .sys

.icl .cab

.exe .spl

.icns .cur

.dll .ocx

.ico .cpl

.cpl .drv

File Encryption

3/9



Ransomware appends  “.atomsilo” extensions to files after encryption. Ransomware uses
“CreateFileMappingA” and “MapViewOfFile” APIs to map the file in memory and moves the
pointer to the start of the mapped file. AtomSilo uses XOR and AES Encryption algorithms
to encrypt files. It generates AES round keys using the “AESKEYGENASSIST”  instruction
as shown in the below figure.

Figure 2: AtomSilo generates encryption keys using AESKEYGENASSIST

The encryption key is 240 bytes. The first 32 bytes are randomly generated by the payload,
and other 208 bytes are generated using the “AESKEYGENASSIST” instruction. In the file ,
it takes 16 bytes of plain text  and does XOR as a first stage encryption. Then, it encrypts it
with 14 rounds of AES encryption. It uses “AESENC” instruction for the first 13 rounds and
the last round uses  “AESENCLAST” instruction.

It encrypts chunks of the file, not the complete file. It encrypts the first 16 bytes, leaves the
next 32 bytes as-is, encrypts the next 16 bytes, and so on. The below screenshot shows the
comparison of the normal file and encrypted file, where we can see that chunks of files are
not encrypted. The encryption key and other information are encrypted and appended at the
end of the encrypted file.

Data Leak site
According to their leak sites, AtomSilo actors won't attack the following types of
organizations:

Hospitals.
Critical infrastructure facilities (nuclear power plants, power plants, water treatment
facilities).
Oil and gas industry (pipelines, oil refineries).
Educational unit.
Non-profit companies.

They also promise to provide free decryption if the victim company is on the above list.

The first data leak was from a Brazilian Pharmaceutical company. AtomSilo published
around 900 GB data as shown in the below screenshot:
