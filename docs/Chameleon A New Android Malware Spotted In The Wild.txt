Banking Trojan targeting mobile users in Australia and Poland
Cyble Research & Intelligence Labs (CRIL) has identified a novel Android Banking Trojan, which we are referring to
as “Chameleon,” based on the commands used by the malware primarily due to the fact that the malware appears to
be a new strain and seems unrelated to any known Trojan families. The Trojan has been active since January 2023
and is specifically observed targeting users in Australia and Poland.

The Chameleon Banking Trojan utilizes the Accessibility Service to perform malicious activities like other Banking
Trojans. The malware pretends to be the popular cryptocurrency app CoinSpot, a government agency in Australia,
and IKO bank from Poland.

In January 2023, the Trojan was observed using icons of different software, such as ChatGPT, Chrome, Bitcoin, etc.,
to infect Android users, as illustrated in the image below.

Chameleon malicious applications are distributed through compromised websites, Discord attachments, and
Bitbucket hosting services. The following URLs are known to be used for distributing the malware:

Auto-uninstallation
Disabling Google Play Protect

The Chameleon Banking Trojan is currently in its early stages of development and has limited capabilities. Its
primary method of stealing users’ credentials is through injection and keylogging techniques. However, it is possible
that new features may be added to the malware in the future.

This analysis focuses on a recently discovered malware sample called CoinSpot.apk, with the SHA-256 hash value
of 153410238d01773e5c705c6d18955793bd61cb2e82c5c7656e74563bb43b3ffa.

The malware is disguised as a legitimate cryptocurrency application called CoinSpot from Australia and connects to
a Command and Control (C&C) server  hxxp://146.70.41[.]143:7242/.

The malware initially performs anti-emulation checks, including verifying whether the device is rooted or debugging
is activated. If the malware identifies any one of these emulation checks, it will terminate its execution.

The below figure shows the code used by malware for anti-emulation checks.

Figure 4 – Anti-emulation checks
Upon identifying the targeted device, the Chameleon Banking Trojan requests the victim to activate the Accessibility
Service. Once the victim grants permission, the malware exploits the Accessibility Service to automatically grant
permissions, prevent uninstallation, disable Play Protect, and perform other malicious activities.

Meanwhile, in the background, the malware connects to the C&C server hxxp://146.70.41[.
[143:7242/api/v1/bots/a2dee0d3-9c1e-e1aa75fce-88c64b9a9de and sends the basic device information such as
device version, model, root status, county, and location as shown in the below image.

Cookie Stealer:
After sending the basic device information, the malware opens the legitimate CoinSpot URL
https://www.coinspot.com.au in a WebView, but in the background, it silently steals the cookies of the loaded URL
and sends them to the server using the ‘cookies’ command.

Figure 7 – Malware stealing cookie for URLs loaded into WebView
The malware uses the below URL pattern to communicate with its C&C server for performing different malicious
activities:

/task – malware sends a GET request and can receive a command in response to execute malicious tasks
/log – malware sends stolen data from the victim’s device
/statistic – malware sends accessibility log

Keylogger:
The malware has incorporated keylogging capabilities by exploiting the Accessibility Service. The malware monitors
and captures the keystrokes using the functions editLog() and writeLog(), and subsequently saves the keylogs in a
database along with the application package name. The keylogs are later sent to the C&C server via the
sendkeylogs() method.

The process is illustrated in the image below.

Injection:
The malware monitors the accessibility event and checks if the “injection” variable is set to “True.” Once this variable
is found to be “True”, the malware calls upon the inject() function, which cross-checks the application’s package
name against a list of targeted applications stored in a local database. If a match is found, the malware proceeds
with the injection.

Figure 9 – Starting injection activity
The injection is a process of creating an overlay on the targeted application by downloading HTML phishing pages
from the C&C server. The malware carries out validation to determine if the HTML phishing page for the targeted
application has already been stored in a database.

If the page is absent, the malware downloads it from the C&C server and stores it in a database. Once the download
process is finished, the malware loads the injection into a WebView, as demonstrated in the provided image.

Lock Grabber:
By exploiting the Accessibility Service, the malware can steal the victim’s device password. First, it identifies the type
of lock being used – whether it is a password, PIN, or even swipe pattern, and then saves the entered credentials
into the database with the lock_grabber command.

SMS Stealer:
The malware has registered an SMSBroadcast Receiver to monitor incoming text messages from the victim’s device
and send the stolen messages to the C&C server. The attacker can harvest the stolen messages later to obtain One-
Time Passwords (OTP) and bypass the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system employed by the bank.

Figure 14 – Malware stealing incoming SMSs
The Chameleon Banking Trojan utilizes shared preference variables such as “is_chameleon,” “app_chameleon”, and
“app_chameleon_name” for auto-uninstallation and preventing uninstallation of the malware. Based on the usage of
this shared preference variable, the malware is dubbed as “Chameleon Banking Trojan”.

The code displayed in the image below uses the Accessibility Service to identify whether the victim is performing any
actions associated with uninstallation, implying that the victim may have suspicions that the installed app is harmful.
If such activity is identified, the malware examines the values saved in the shared preference variable and uninstalls
itself from the device to erase any evidence of its existence.

The malware contains an unused feature that enables it to download a payload during runtime. The code snippet
shown in the image illustrates how the malware downloads the payload and saves it as a “.jar” file. Later, the code
uses DexClassLoader to execute the payload.

Conclusion

8/10



Based on our analysis, Chameleon Banking Trojan can pose a threat to Android users. The malware has been
operational since January 2023 and currently possesses the basic functionalities of a Banking Trojan.

However, there is a potential for malware to introduce new and more sophisticated features in the future, which could
expand its target base beyond its current scope. If such features are introduced, it could potentially make
Chameleon Banking Trojan a significant threat and put it in the same category as prominent and prevalent Banking
Trojans.

Cyble Research & Intelligence Lab (CRIL) will continue to monitor the evolution of this malware and keep our
readers updated with our latest findings.
