Overview 
Throughout the summer and fall of 2023, DarkGate entered the ring competing for the top spot in the remote
access trojan (RAT) and loader category. It was observed in use by multiple cybercrime actors and was spread
via many methods such as email, Microsoft Teams, Skype, malvertising and fake updates. 

Proofpoint researchers are tracking a particularly interesting operator of the DarkGate malware. At the time of
publication, researchers are not attributing this cluster of activity to a known threat actor and are temporarily
calling it BattleRoyal. Between September and November 2023, at least 20 email campaigns used DarkGate
malware with GroupIDs “PLEX”, “ADS5”, “user_871236672” and “usr_871663321”. The GroupID is a
configuration setting that is also referred to as username, botnet, campaign, or flag 23. The campaigns are
notable for: 

Delivery: via email and RogueRaticate fake browser updates 
Volumes and geography: email campaigns include tens of thousands of emails targeting dozens of
industries primarily in USA and Canada 
Attack chain: includes a variety of notable tools such as 404 TDS, Keitaro TDS, and .URL files exploiting
CVE-2023-36025

Volume of DarkGate campaigns based on four GroupIDs discussed in this report. 

TDS all the things! (an email campaign example) 
On October 2, 2023, Proofpoint identified one of the first campaigns in this cluster. It was notable due to the use
of more than one traffic delivery system (TDS), specifically 404 TDS and Keitaro TDS. Additionally, the .URL
files involved exploited CVE-2023-36025, a vulnerability in Windows SmartScreen. While other parts of the
attack chain from this actor changed or varied, .URL files were involved in every campaign.  

The emails in this campaign contained: 

404 TDS URLs that, if clicked by the user, redirected to Keitaro TDS 
Keitaro TDS was observed serving an internet shortcut (.URL) file 
The internet shortcut, if double clicked, downloaded a zipped VBS script 
The VBS in turn downloaded and executed several shell commands (cmd.exe) 
The shell commands (a) created a directory on C: drive, (b) copied curl.exe from system folder to this new
directory, (c) used the curl to download Autoit3.exe, (d) used curl to download and save an AutoIT script,
and (e) ran the downloaded AutoIT script with the downloaded AutoIT interpreter 
The AutoIT script ran an embedded DarkGate 

Attack chain summary that follows the flow of: Email > 404 TDS > Keitaro TDS > .URL > .VBS > Shell
commands > AutoIT / AutoIT script > DarkGate.

Proofpoint has identified multiple cybercriminal campaigns exploiting CVE-2023-36025; however, the
BattleRoyal cluster exploited this vulnerability more than any other actor observed in Proofpoint threat data.
Notably, this activity cluster exploited CVE-2023-36025 before it was published by Microsoft. SmartScreen is a
security feature that is designed to prevent people from visiting malicious websites. The vulnerability could allow
an actor to bypass the SmartScreen defenses if a user clicked on a specially crafted .URL file or a hyperlink
pointing to a .URL file. More specifically, a SmartScreen alert would not be triggered when a .URL points to a
SMB or WebDav share as file:// and the malicious payload is inside a ZIP file which is specified in the URL
target.   

RogueRaticate (fake browser update campaign example) 
On October 19, 2023, an external researcher identified and publicly shared details of the RogueRaticate fake
update activity cluster using an interesting obfuscation technique first identified in 2020. Proofpoint subsequently
identified the activity in Proofpoint data. This campaign delivered fake browser update requests to end users on
their web browsers that dropped a DarkGate payload with the “ADS5” GroupID. The threat actor injected a
request to a domain they controlled that used .css steganography to conceal the malicious code. The
stenography would then make a request to an actor controlled Keitaro domain that would filter out unwanted
traffic. Users who passed the traffic inspection would be redirected to a fake browser update. If an end user
clicked on the fake browser update button, it would download a similar .URL file as the email campaign
described above and follow the attack chain from that point to deliver DarkGate.

Switch to NetSupport (an email campaign example) 
In late November to early December, Proofpoint analysts observed the activity cluster replace DarkGate with
NetSupport, a legitimate remote access tool, in observed campaigns. Compared to DarkGate, NetSupport is a
more established tool in the toolbelt of various crime actors. It has steadily been observed in the landscape in
the past four years. Meanwhile, the use of DarkGate before summer 2023 has been very rare. It remains to be
seen if the reason for payload switch is due to the spike in DarkGate’s popularity and the subsequent attention
paid to the malware by threat researchers and security community (which can lead to reduction of efficacy), or
simply a temporary change to a different payload. Besides the payload switch, another notable change in this
campaign that represents a gradual evolution of the cluster includes the use of two .URL files instead of one. 

In an example campaign on November 28, 2023, the emails contained: 

Doubleclick.net URLs that, if clicked by the user, redirected to Keitaro TDS 
Keitaro TDS was observed serving an Internet shortcut (.URL) file  
The Internet shortcut, if double clicked, downloaded another Internet shortcut (.URL) file  
The second Internet shortcut linked to a NetSupport executable 

Attack chain summary that follows the flow of: Email > URL (doubleclick.net) > Keitaro TDS (Cookie: 6e41c) >
.URL > .URL > NetSupport.

Conclusion 
The newly identified cluster of activity Proofpoint calls BattleRoyal is notable for its use of multiple attack chains
to deliver malware. DarkGate can be used to steal information and download additional malware payloads, and
NetSupport can enable threat actors to gain control of an infected host, install additional malware, and enable
lateral movement throughout a compromised environment. The actor’s use of both email and compromised
websites with fake update lures to deliver DarkGate and NetSupport is unique but aligns with the overall trend
Proofpoint has observed of cybercriminal threat actors adopting new, varied, and increasingly creative attack
chains – including the use of various TDS tools – to enable malware delivery. Additionally, the use of both email
and fake update lures shows the actor using multiple types of social engineering techniques in an attempt to get
users to install the final payload.
