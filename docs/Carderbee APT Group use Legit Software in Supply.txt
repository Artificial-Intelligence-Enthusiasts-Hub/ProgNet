 12.20pm BST, 22 August 2023: Updated with additional IoCs

A previously unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) group used the legitimate Cobra
DocGuard software to carry out a supply chain attack with the goal of deploying the Korplug
backdoor (aka PlugX) onto victim computers.

In the course of this attack, the attackers used malware signed with a legitimate Microsoft
certificate. Most of the victims in this campaign are based in Hong Kong, with some victims
based in other regions of Asia.

Korplug is known to be used by multiple APT groups, but we could not link this activity to a
known threat actor so we have given the actor behind this activity a new name —
Carderbee. 

1/5



Cobra DocGuard and Previous Activity
Cobra DocGuard Client is software produced by a China-based company called EsafeNet
and appears to legitimately be used to protect, encrypt, and decrypt software. EsafeNet is
owned by Chinese information security firm NSFOCUS.

According to a report from ESET, in September 2022, a malicious update to this software
was used to compromise a gambling company in Hong Kong. The same gambling company
had been compromised in September 2021 using the same technique by Budworm (aka
LuckyMouse, APT27), which led ESET to attribute this September 2022 attack to Budworm
too. In that attack, a new variant of the Korplug malware was also found. In that instance, it
used the magic header “ESET”, indicating that it may have been modified to try to bypass
ESET products.

A signed version of Korplug was also used in the activity investigated by the Symantec
Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom. This activity began in April 2023. However, we did
not find any other evidence to indicate that this attack was carried out by Budworm. Korplug
is a backdoor that is known to be used by multiple APTs, including APT41 and Budworm. We
do not have any indication of the industry sectors of the companies targeted in this recent
activity, just their geographic location.

Accordingly, it was not possible to link this activity definitively to a known group, which is why
we attributed it to a new group, Carderbee.

Attack Chain
Malicious activity was seen on about 100 computers in impacted organizations; however, the
Cobra DocGuard software was installed on around 2,000 computers, indicating that the
attacker may be selectively pushing payloads to specific victims.

The malicious software was delivered to the following location on infected computers, which
is what indicates that a supply chain attack or malicious configuration involving Cobra
DocGuard is how the attackers compromised affected computers:

"csidl_system_drive\program files\esafenet\cobra docguard client\update"

Over a period of a few months in 2023, multiple distinct malware families were observed
being deployed via this method. In one interesting case, a downloader deployed by the
attackers had a digitally signed certificate from Microsoft, called Microsoft Windows
Hardware Compatibility Publisher. This downloader was used to install the Korplug backdoor
on targeted systems. The downloader attempted to download a file named update.zip from
the following location: http://cdn.stream-amazon[.]com/update.zip.

The update.zip file is a zlib compressed archive file. It decompresses and executes a file
named content.dll. This file is not saved on disk. It acts as a dropper and contains x64 and
x86 drivers, which are dropped depending on the system environment. The dropper creates
services and registry entries. The dropped drivers read encrypted data from the registry,
decrypt it, and inject it into svchost.exe. The injected payload is the Korplug backdoor. 

The Korplug sample downloaded here is able to:

Execute commands via cmd
Enumerate files
Check running processes
Download files 
Open firewall ports
Act as a keylogger

Microsoft Certificate Abuse
Use of Microsoft-signed malware is a known problem. In December 2022, Mandiant noted a
POORTRY driver sample signed with a Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility
Authenticode signature. Most recently, in July 2023, Trend said that it had found a Microsoft-
signed rootkit that appeared to have passed through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs
(WHQL) process for getting a valid signature. Microsoft acknowledged the issue and said
that drivers certified by Microsoft’s Windows Hardware Developer Program (MWHDP) were
being used maliciously in post-exploitation activity. 

The company said it had investigated the issue and “determined that the activity was limited
to the abuse of several developer program accounts and that no Microsoft account
compromise has been identified.” Malware signed with what appears to be a legitimate
certificate can make it much harder for security software to detect.

Supply Chain Attack and Certificate Abuse
It seems clear that the attackers behind this activity are patient and skilled actors. They
leverage both a supply chain attack and signed malware to carry out their activity in an
attempt to stay under the radar. The fact that they appear to only deploy their payload on a
handful of the computers they gain access to also points to a certain amount of planning and
reconnaissance on behalf of the attackers behind this activity. Software supply chain attacks
remain a major issue for organizations in all sectors, with multiple high-profile supply chain
attacks occurring in the last 12 months, including the MOVEit, X_Trader, and 3CX attacks.

Some unanswered questions remain about the activity of Carderbee, such as what sectors
the group was targeting with this activity, and whether there are any links between
Carderbee and other actors such as Budworm.

Symantec researchers will continue to track this activity, and we share indicators of
compromise below so our colleagues in the security community can do so as well.

If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect
and block that file.
