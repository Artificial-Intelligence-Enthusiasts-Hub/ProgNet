We recently discovered a new variety of malicious loader that targets macOS, presumably
linked to the BlueNoroff APT gang and its ongoing campaign known as RustBucket. The
threat actor is known to attack financial organizations, particularly companies, whose activity
is in any way related to cryptocurrency, as well as individuals who hold crypto assets or take
an interest in the subject. Information about the new loader variant first appeared in an X
(formerly Twitter) post.

Earlier RustBucket versions spread its malicious payload via an app disguised as a PDF
viewer. By contrast, this new variety was found inside a ZIP archive that contained a PDF file
named, “Crypto-assets and their risks for financial stability”, with a thumbnail that showed a
corresponding title page. The metadata preserved inside the ZIP archive suggests the app
was created on October 21, 2023.

Exactly how the archive spread is unknown. The cybercriminals might have emailed it to
targets as they did with past campaigns.

The app had a valid signature when it was discovered, but the certificate has since been
revoked.

App signature details

Written in Swift and named “EdoneViewer”, the executable is a universal format file that
contains versions for both Intel and Apple Silicon chips. Decryption of the XOR-encrypted
payload is handled by the main function, CalculateExtameGCD. While the decryption

process is running, the app puts out unrelated messages to the terminal to try and lull the
analyst’s vigilance.

The decrypted payload has the AppleScript format:

AppleScript code executed after the payload is deciphered

The script assembles and runs the following shell command:

Once assembled, the shell command goes through the following steps:

Downloads a PDF file, save it at /Users/Shared/Crypto-assets and their risks for
financial stability.pdf, and opens it. This is a benign file launched as a diversion.

Title page of the PDF decoy

Sends a POST request to the server and saves the response to a hidden file named
“.pw” and located at /Users/Shared/.
Grants permissions to the file and executes it with the C&C address as an argument.

The C&C server is hosted at hxxp://on-global[.]xyz, a domain name registered fairly recently,
on October 20, 2023. We were unable to find any links between the domain and any other
files or threats.

The .pw file is a Trojan we detected back in August. Like the loader, this is a universal format
file:

Details of the .pw file

The file collects and sends the following system information to the C&C:

Computer name
OS version
Time zone
Device startup date
OS installation date
Current time
List of running processes

The data is collected and forwarded in cycles every minute. The Trojan expects one of the
following three commands in response:

Command # Description

0x0 Save response to file and run

0x1 Delete local copy and shut down

Any other number Keep waiting for command

After receiving a 0x0 command, the program saves data sent with the command to the
shared file named “.pld” and located at /Users/Shared/, gives it the read/write/run
permissions and executes it:

Unfortunately, we did not receive a single command from the server during our analysis, so
we were unable to find out the content of the following attack stage. The Trojan can now be
detected by most anti-malware solutions:
