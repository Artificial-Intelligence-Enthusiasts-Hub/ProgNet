Security experts from Qi An Xin company recently uncovered cyberattacks on activists
associated with the Kurdistan Democratic Party by a previously unknown hacker group
named “Caracal Kitten.”

The Caracal Kitten group disguised malware as official Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP)
mobile apps. Users, mistaking these apps for genuine ones, unwittingly installed them,
granting hackers access to their contacts, SMS, and messenger data.

Qi An Xin analysts investigating this malicious campaign found that cybercriminals utilized
two types of malware simultaneously: MOrder RAT and Ahmyth RAT.

MOrder RAT allowed them to receive and execute remote commands from their server,
permitting actions such as uploading contacts, SMS, and other data. Ahmyth RAT, on the
other hand, enabled covert photo and video recording, audio recording, and access to the
victim’s location.

As the report says, the attacks on KDP were carried out in two stages—during the summer
of 2021 and from May 2023 onward. The malware code contained time zone settings
corresponding to the Middle East, and some IP addresses used by the hackers were linked
to major telecom operators in the region.

Due to the group’s tactics, researchers coined the name “Caracal Kitten” for the group, which
refers to a cat breed found in certain Middle Eastern countries.
