Counter Threat Unit Research Team

The COBALT DICKENS threat group persists despite law enforcement actions and public
disclosures, conducting another global campaign targeting universities. Wednesday,
September 11, 2019 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
In March 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted the Mabna Institute and nine Iranian
associates for compromising hundreds of universities to steal intellectual property and
benefit financially. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers assigned the

1/14



name COBALT DICKENS to this likely Iranian government-directed threat group. Despite this
indictment and other disclosures of COBALT DICKENS campaigns, the threat group (also
known as Silent Librarian) shows no signs of stopping its activity as of this publication.
CTU™ researchers have observed the threat actors using free online services as part of
their operations, including free certificates, domains, and publicly available tools.

In July and August 2019, CTU researchers discovered a new large global phishing operation
launched by COBALT DICKENS. This operation is similar to the threat group's August 2018
campaign, using compromised university resources to send library-themed phishing emails.
The messages contain links to spoofed login pages for resources associated with the
targeted universities. Unlike previous campaigns that contained shortened links to obscure
the attackers' infrastructure, these messages contain the spoofed URL (see Figure 1).

Recipients who click this link are directed to a web page that looks identical or similar to the
spoofed library resource. After the victims enter their credentials, their web browsers are
redirected to the next.php file, where the credentials are stored locally in the pass.txt file. The
victim's browser is then sent to the legitimate site being spoofed (see Figure 2).

For this campaign, the threat actors registered at least 20 new domains targeting over 60
universities in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, and
Switzerland. These domains were registered using the Freenom domain provider, which
administers the following free top-level domains (TLDs) unless the domain is considered
"special":

.ml

.ga

.cf

.gq

.tk

 
Many of these domains use valid SSL certificates, likely to make the spoofed pages appear
authentic. The overwhelming majority of the certificates observed in 2019 were issued by
Let's Encrypt, a nonprofit organization that programmatically issues free certificates.
However, past campaigns used certificates issued by the Comodo certificate authority.

COBALT DICKENS uses publicly available tools, including the SingleFile plugin available on
GitHub and the free HTTrack Website Copier standalone application, to copy the login pages
of targeted university resources. Metadata in a spoofed login page created on August 1
suggests that COBALT DICKENS sometimes uses older copied versions of target websites.
A comment left in the source code indicates it was originally copied on May 1, 2017 (see
Figure 3). However, the university was targeted by numerous COBALT DICKENS operations,
including the August 2018 and August 2019 campaigns.

Metadata in other spoofed web pages supports the assessment that the threat actors are of
Iranian origin. Specifically, a page copied on August 3 reveals an Iranian-related timestamp
(see Figure 4).

As of this publication, CTU researchers observed COBALT DICKENS targeting at least 380
universities in over 30 countries. Many universities have been targeted multiple times. The
threat actors have not changed their operations despite law enforcement activity, multiple
public disclosures, and takedown activity.

Some educational institutions have implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) to
specifically address this threat. While implementing additional security controls like MFA
could seem burdensome in environments that value user flexibility and innovation, single-
password accounts are insecure. CTU researchers recommend that all organizations protect
Internet-facing resources with MFA to mitigate credential-focused threats.

To provide broader awareness of the threat group's campaigns and curtail its activities, CTU
researchers listed all known domains associated with COBALT DICKENS operations in Table
1. Several domains used prior to the indictment remain in use as of this publication. CTU
researchers recommend that organizations use available controls to review and restrict
access to these domains. They may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before
opening them in a browser.
